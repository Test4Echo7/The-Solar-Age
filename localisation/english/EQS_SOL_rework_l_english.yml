  solarreworked.40.t:0 "An Offer that Can't be Refused"
  solarreworked.40.d:0 "Daybreaker sipped on her tea.\n\n"I can't believe that I'm being subjected to such an indignity!" her guest protested as he squirmed and fumed across the table from her. She merely smiled. As he glowered at her, she sipped again on her tea and then daintily set it aside, next to a large stack of tomes that had been placed on the right side of the table.\n\n"Chancellor Neighsay," she began, her voice dripping with false understanding, "I can completely see your point of view, but—" she shrugged "—I'm afraid that I will have to be insistent."\n\nNeighsay, his cyan eyes burning with fury, quivered and shook with rage. While his cheeks turned a deep shade of purple, he snarled, "I will NOT see the EEA turned into nothing more than a mouthpiece for whatever propaganda you purport to be scientific fact! We have standards! We have codes! We have—"\n\n"Almost no funding left," Daybreaker interjected, as she wrote something down on a napkin near her tea. She stuck out her tongue thoughtfully. "By my quick and dirty math, I'd say... you're at approximately... oh, five percent funding as when you entered." When she stated that, she sneered when he gagged in shock and his eyes went wide.\n\n"That's preposterous! I was assured—"\n\n"You were assured nothing! We met to discuss the new EEA curriculum, and how to properly educate our ponies, but you, sadly, believed that it was 'propaganda' and 'brainwashing'." She clicked her tongue. "It'd be such a shame that you'll be remembered as the last Chairpony of the EEA, and the one that led to its demise." Pursing her lips in an expression of mock compassion. "So sad," she pouted.\n\n"B-But I shall not—"\n\n"And that's four percent remaining."\n\n"Y-You can't—"\n\n"Three percent."\n\n"T-These are nothing but—"\n\n"Two percent."\n\n"Fine! Fine!" Neighsay screamed, throwing himself against the table, which made it rattle and spill tea onto his impeccably clean, red tunic. "I will implement the new curriculum! I can't have my legacy destroyed!"\n\nStaying silent for a moment, Daybreaker grinned. She sipped on her tea."
  solarreworked.40.a:0 "Good pet."

  ###Flavour Events###
  solarreworked.100.t:0 "Personal Reminders"
  solarreworked.100.d:0 ""I-It's an, um, pleasure, to host you, Y-Your Majesty," Posey Shy meekly stated as she brought out a pot of tea from the kitchen of she and her husband's humble abode. Cracking an awkward smile, she placed the pot on the small table in their living room. When Daybreaker arched a brow, Posey adjusted her glasses and tittered uneasily. She poured a cup and passed it to Daybreaker, who merely gazed at it for a second before sipping on it.\n\n"Not to be rude, Your Grace, b-but why did you say you came again?" Posey's husband, Gentle Breeze, inquired with a quivering voice. He nervously switched his attention between the two guards that were standing at rapt attention at the entrance to the living room.\n\nAfter taking another drink of her tea, Daybreaker merely looked at him for a moment, then quipped, "Does your Empress require a reason to impose upon her subjects?"\n\n"No! Not at all! I'm merely confused why it would be US?" Gentle glanced between him and his wife. Although it was faint, there was a spark of worry in his eyes, beyond just being in the presence of his better.\n\nBefore Daybreaker could respond, the front door of the Shy's slammed and a carefree, young voice exclaimed, "Yo, Mom! Pops! I'm back from an aching long day. Won't ya come out here and help grab my stuff?" Seconds later, an aquamarine pegasus trotted into the room and gasped. "You're hosting a '"Welcome back, Zephyr" party?!' You shouldn't have!" He shot one glance at Daybreaker. "Heya, Hot Stuff."\n\nBraying indignantly, Daybreaker nodded her head and both guards darted to seize Zephyr. He let out a whinny of surprise, but stated, "You know, if you really like me that much—"\n\n"Silence, foal!" Daybreaker hissed. Bending down to stare him in the eyes, she growled, "As one of the Element Bearers' siblings, ponies look to you, whether you realize it or not."\n\nDaybreaker unfurled a letter. "Normally, draft dodging is below me, but in this case, I'll make an exception."\n\n"N-Now, I'm sure there's an explanation for—" Posey began before Daybreaker glared directly into her soul. She squeaked and went mute.\n\nSquinting, Zephyr inspected the letter while making a low hum. He shrugged, "Sorry, Hot Stuff. Not interested. All that blood and guts would ruin my resplendent mane job."\n\nWith a low growl, Daybreaker bared her teeth and yanked him forward by the muzzle with her magic. Her eyes narrowed. "I wasn't asking, foal!""
  solarreworked.100.a:0 "Nopony defies me!"
  solarreworked.101.t:0 "No Vacation"
  solarreworked.101.d:0 ""Can't believe the nerve of her," Zephyr Breeze grumbled softly as he settled into a nook between a couple of trees. Twelve weeks of basic, just to be thrown a gun and then left out to rot on some smelly battlefield. Did they know how many grains of dirt he'd found underneath his hooves?! More than one! Couldn't even take a Celestia-foresaken nap around his sergeant without getting screamed at.\n\nThankfully no blood had gotten on him yet, but if he had to fight a bug or something with his bayonet, then all that ichor would stain him for months.\n\nSuddenly, a bullet whizzed by his head and broke his reverie. A second later, a couple of screams carried toward him, and he yawned as he tried to drown things out. Apparently there was some battle going on right now, but who cared? He needed to catch up on some zs, and his CO wasn't paying attention right now.\n\nHowever, between the noise of combat and the deep-seated anger he felt from that admittedly looker of an alicorn who hauled him off to boot camp, he could barely get any rest. Cracking an eye open, he grunted when it grew quiet, and he huffed before getting up and checking on the command post, which was nearby. Perhaps one of the nerds there could tell him of a nice hiding spot to snooze away the day.\n\nAfter weaving through a few corridors, which had klaxon sirens blaring, he spotted the quarters of the regiment's general, Cuff Link, and poked his head in. "Heya, General?" he asked, an idea coming to his mind. Nopony was there.\n\nGrinning from ear to ear, he slunk in and poked around in the wardrobe. Sure enough, there was a spare uniform, like he hoped there would be. After quickly donning, he turned around, and screamed when a soldier rushed into the room. However, the soldier saluted, and exclaimed, "General! You were reported killed in battle. What are you doing here?!"\n\nZephyr's mind raced. Sweat trickled down his neck. Stuttering, he fibbed, "W-Well, that's obviously because somepony who LOOKED like me was killed. I was here the entire time. Definitely." He cracked an uneasy smile.\n\nPanic etched into his face, the soldier grabbed him without questioning the lie. "Part of the line has been broken! We need you to direct its regrouping!" Before Zephyr could protest, he was grabbed by a hoof, and pulled toward the communications room. Zephyr could only sigh."
  solarreworked.101.a:0 "This is my life, apparently."
  solarreworked.102.t:0 "A Good Jig"
  solarreworked.102.d:0 "Kicking back in his office chair and sighing, Zephyr Breeze slipped his both his forelegs behind his head pressed as far as he could into the plush leather. In only a few weeks, he had completely transformed that stuffy, old room that the geezer before him had used into a hip and fun place. A few pictures—of himself, of course—an icebox with a selection of various ciders, and a pool table. Could still use a few more amenities, but it was a start.\n\nOutside his office, he could hear ponies rushing to and fro, and one mare quickly poked her head in to inquire, "Have you finished, General?"\n\n"Hm?" Zephyr cracked an eyelid open. "Oh, yeah, yeah!" Swiping a single page from his desk, which he spent all of maybe two seconds reading, he tossed it toward her. From the title, he thought it might have been something about fireworks, or the like.Something with some big booms. Maybe they were all using those giant guns a couple miles away for a show later.\n\n"What about the inventory reports on our current medical supplies?" the aide asked as she took the page in her magic.\n\n"Oh, uh, I gave that to Corporal, uh, Smudge or something," Zephyr mumbled as he started to slip back into sleep. Yawning, he muttered, "You know, delegation is key to success!" He spread his wings to stretch them, then waved her off. "You can go now. I'm just going to, uh, think on some new battle plans. Yeah!"\n\nDutifully, the mare left and his door clicked shut. For a few minutes, the hustle and bustle continued outside, but it soon grew disturbingly quiet as a few sets of hooves stomped toward his office. As the door slammed open, he sighed, "Yo, what'd I tell you about—"\n\nAs his vision cleared, he froze when he saw a unicorn with the exact same fur and mane color as him glowering at him, while standing between two guards, who were also looking outraged. The double, who was probably about fifteen years older, was missing part of an ear, and had a large gauze patch over half his face and neck. He wore a general's uniform.\n\nZephyr gulped. "Ah, General Link! I-I heard that you were KIA. But, uh, I see I was wrong." As the general's glower deepened, Zephyr spied the window in the office, and tensed. "I'd love to chat, but, uh, I kept your seat warm, and uh, I think I'll be going!" Leaping for the window, he punched through the glass, and was soon nothing more than a distant speck on the horizon."
  solarreworked.102.a:0 "Buck! Buck! Buck!"
  solarreworked.103.t:0 "Visitors from the South"
  solarreworked.103.d:0 "It wasn't often that Refraction saw life along the border between [CRY.GetNameDef] and [EQS.GetNameDef]. With her station set along one of the few small settlements of [CRY.GetNameDef], she had a relatively quiet position. In the past, there had been an odd incident or two of an accused changeling infiltrator, before it was determined that it was just a unicorn with a mild allergy to magic. There was even a bugbear once, but it was being directed by Fluttershy to a safe nesting location, so it wasn't much of a threat.\n\nTherefore, when she caught some movement in the sky on her way back to her station for the evening, she frowned. Readying her rifle, she took aim and traced it as it grew larger. Soon enough, she could see it was a lanky pegasus. Since she was concealed by some of the shrubs in the wooded area near the town, she could watch him as he approached.\n\nHe seemed to be fleeing. Every so often, he'd glance over his shoulders like he was being pursued, but he wasn't being followed, from what she could see. When he was about three hundred feet out and above her, she stepped and called, "Halt! You're entering [CRY.GetAdjective] territory!" He screamed with a haggard gasp and noticed her. She held her gun at the ready.\n\nFreezing and looking at her gun, he obeyed and descended. When his hooves touched the earth, he collapsed and began to kiss it. "Thank Celestia!" he exclaimed when he stopped. "Finally somepony to help me!" Before Refraction could ask him anything, he grabbed both her shoulders and shook her. "They're after me! I-I barely made it out! I know they're hunting little ol' me!"\n\nShe pushed him back. Arching a brow, she demanded, "Who's hunting you?" Now that she was closer, she could tell he was wearing a rather sweat-drenched uniform of an [EQS.GetAdjective] officer. "Wait," she began. "Are you an [EQS.GetAdjective] soldier?" She tightened her grip on her rifle.\n\nFor a second, he blinked at her, and then he bobbed his head up and down frantically. "Y-Yeah, totally! Five star gen-er-RAL!" He fluttered his lashes at her innocently. "They were cramping my style, so I said, 'No thanks, buckos!' and then they just started chasing me!" He hopped up. "Super important pony, after all." He shot her a smug grin. "Probably sent a whole army after me."\n\n"Right..." she muttered. "Well, it'll have to be verified, but if you're an [EQS.GetAdjective] general..." Pausing for a second, she finally quipped, "I think we have a job for you.""
  solarreworked.103.a:0 "Oh no."
