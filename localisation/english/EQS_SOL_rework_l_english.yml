  EQS_sanity_bop:0 "The Princess's Burden"
  EQS_sanity_bop_desc:0 "In the changing world, an alicorn must adapt to the necessities of the modern ethos. Princess Celestia has led the nation of Equestria for a thousand years, and in that time she has seen kingdoms rise and fall, villains conquer and be conquered, and technology approach the levels of magic. In these dark times of turbulent war, it falls to her and her alone to shoulder this responsibility and make the difficult decisions for the good of Equestria. However, not even an immortal alicorn is safe from the burdens of war..."

Dissent within the ranks is unacceptable, and it's time that these thorns disappear."

Since the Empress ascended, there have been no games held, and her subjects have begun to clamor for another. If she grants their wish, it shall be the last, since the antiquated mindset has no place in the Solar Empire and should be replaced."

  ###Decisions###
  EQS_solar_fury_category:0 "An Alicorn's §OFury§!"
  EQS_solar_fury_category_desc:0 "It is a dreadful thing to corner an alicorn.\n\nOur enemies know not what they §Rsow§!."
  EQS_fury_of_sun:0 "§RUnleash the Power of the Sun!§!"
  EQS_fury_of_sun_desc:0 "The enemy is at our gates, but we are not without support. Our Empress guides our armies in the heat of battle, and she is capable of destroying entire armies without our aid. If she were to unleash that power, all those that threaten us would fall like dead grass in her wake!"
  EQS_become_daybreaker_bop:0 "§RAscend§!"
  EQS_become_daybreaker_bop_desc:0 "The enemy is at our gates. Ponies perish. [EQS.GetNameDef] is collapsing. Salvation is near, but my ponies must be §Rready§!.\n\nThey [GetCelestiasBopPopularSupport]."
  EQS_CelestiasPopularSupport_max_evil_bop:0 "§Rwill follow me into the gates of Tartarus§!"
  EQS_militias_desc:0 "War has not touched [ROOT.GetNameDef] for centuries. Although the government has the power to institute hard drafts of the populace in times of crisis, this power has never been utilized since it was signed into law, and mmost ponies would be hard-pressed to comply with letters of drafting. However, our ponies deeply love our country, and if we continue to suffer losses on the front, it may be enough to motivate them to join if the desperate hour arises."
  EQS_melt_our_foes:0 "Melt our Foes"
  EQS_pierce_the_heart:0 "Pierce the Enemy's Hearts"
  EQS_endless_service:0 "Death is not the End"
  EQS_invincible_soldiers:0 "Undying Service"
  SOL_societal_unrest:0 "Solidify Control"
  SOL_societal_unrest_desc:0 "Our new regime is a tenuous one. Few ponies currently would follow Daybreaker's lead, and it is clear to all that Celestia is gone. If actions are not implemented swiftly to crack down on dissent and silence the harshest critics, any chance of saving them from themselves will be lost and there could very well be a new war on our hooves."
  SOL_investigate_ponyville:0 "Investigate Ponyville's Castle"
  SOL_investigate_ponyville_desc:0 "Although Daybreaker's regime is now absolute, not everypony follows her completely. In alleyways and backrooms, many still believe that they must "free" Equestria from her reign. After a series of arrests in Manehattan from a series of organized strikes and one damaged factory, [ROOT.GetAgency] has learned that Starlight Glimmer, former friendship student of Twilight Sparkle, is involved with the Resistance. Although she has gone to ground, we must start somewhere, and that somewhere is Twilight Sparkle's former home: the Castle of Friendship."
  SOL_follow_fillydelphia_lead:0 "Follow Leads to Fillydelphia"
  SOL_follow_fillydelphia_lead_desc:0 "The clues found in Ponyville point to Starlight and Trixie spending some time in Fillydelphia, and there is a narrow list of places which they could have attended. Fillydelphia has been pacified, so it should not take long to find with whom they were going to meet."
  SOL_raid_ponyville_cottage:0 "Raid Old Ponyville Cottage"
  SOL_raid_ponyville_cottage_desc:0 "On the edge of Ponyville, there is a cottage that is almost within the Everfree Forest. Evidence obtained while searching the Castle of Friendship points to Starlight and Trixie going there to meet with a supplier. As it is abandoned and surrounded by hostile wildlife, there could be stashes of equipment, and perhaps an indication of where they went to next."
  SOL_raid_freeside_restaurant:0 "Raid Restaurant in Freeside"
  SOL_raid_freeside_restaurant_desc:0 "The information obtained in Fillydelphia points to a restuarant in Summerfield as a front for some Resistance members to meet and plan further insurrection. The proprieter is obviously complicit, and may very well know more of the whereabouts of further Resistance members, and perhaps the two public enemies, as well."
  SOL_investigate_new_horseleans_docks:0 "Investigate New Horseleans Docks"
  SOL_investigate_new_horseleans_docks_desc:0 "Although the Freeside information is scarce, there were a couple of letters between a Daffodil Drop and another member of the Resistance, which indicates that there is an information network within New Horseleans and that the dockyards are generally where Daffodil meets with her contacts. Scouring will take time, but capturing her alive will be well worth it."
  SOL_investigate_dead_drop:0 "Investigate Manehattan Dead Drop"
  SOL_investigate_dead_drop_desc:0 "The evidence found points to Manehattan being a frequent nexus of Resistance members exchanging information, which is not surprising given the extremely well-organized nature that most activity in that region experiences. Although we do not have a member for whom we can search, there is a location of a dead drop, as it recently changed, which gives us the perfect location to wait for a member to come looking for a communique."
  SOL_search_jungle_camp:0 "Search Abandoned Jungle Camp"
  SOL_search_jungle_camp_desc:0 "From what we have been able to gather through witnesses and searching the few possessions Daffodil Drop had, there appears to have been an encampent outside of New Horseleans where a number of Resistance members cooridnated some future attacks. Given how long it took us to find the information, it is unlikely we can catch anypony in the act, but there are bound to be clues that can be discovered."
  SOL_search_manehattan_opera_house:0 "Scour Manehattan Opera House"
  SOL_search_manehattan_opera_house_desc:0 "There was little to be gained from camping the dead drop, but after speaking to one pony, we learned that Trixie Lulamoon was seen there in the last couple of weeks, after the date of the letter regarding the dead drop location. Although it is a small chance, investigating the Manehattan Opera House, where she was last seen, could yield some fruit."
  SOL_raid_dodge_city_post_office:0 "Raid Dodge City Post Office"
  SOL_raid_dodge_city_post_office_desc:0 "The paper scraps in the New Horseleans camp have not yielded much, but on multiple there was a stamp of Dodge City on them. Dodge City is not large, and there are only a hoofful of post offices, especially those that are near the partial address on three of the scraps. If the offices are used a gateway for communication, it should not be hard to sniff it out."
  SOL_hunt_for_mareway_informant:0 "Hunt for Mareway Resistance Contact"
  SOL_hunt_for_mareway_informant_desc:0 "Among the half-burnt paper that we have reclaimed, a common name and location springs up in many of them. Sunrise Showers, a resident of Mareway, appears to be working with the Resistance, perhaps as a fence, perhaps as a proper member. A marehunt across all of Mareway will take some time, but capturing her alive will ideally give us a name or locations of recent Resistance meetings."
  SOL_raid_friendship_school:0 "Raid Ponyville Friendship School"
  SOL_raid_friendship_school_desc:0 "When the Empress's rule began, the School of Friendship in Ponyville was one of the first things to be shut down. Starlight and Trixie were both employees of the school, and it seems that they have used it as a meeting place in the past. There could be valuable information left behind there to bring us closer to stamping out this Resistance for good."
  SOL_investigate_raritys_manehattan_boutique:0 "Investigate Rarity's Manehattan Boutique"
  SOL_investigate_raritys_manehattan_boutique_desc:0 "Continuing to follow Trixie's scraps of information, we have been led to "Rarity for You," as there were receipts for a new cape and hat which were being custom-made by one of the tailors there. The owner, Coco Pommel, has been a loyal assistant to the Empire. Questioning her should be most frutiful."
  SOL_search_castle_for_clues:0 "Search for Clues in Everfree Castle"
  SOL_search_castle_for_clues_desc:0 "Evidence from the search of the School of Friendship point to the Everfree Forest, specifically, the Castle of the Two Sisters. A hidden, remote, and dangerous location such as it would pose a perfect staging ground for meetings and clandestine agreements. Since it is a desolate place, it should not take long to surface anything."
  SOL_find_information_in_canterlot_library:0 "Search [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Library for Information"
  SOL_find_information_in_canterlot_library_desc:0 "A piece of paper from our search of the old castle point to the head library of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as a safehouse and communications dispatch for the central region of the Empire. If we are able to apprehend a live Resistance member there, we should stand a strong chance of finding one of the heads of the Resistance."
  SOL_investigate_raritys_canterlot_boutique:0 "Investigate Rarity's [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Boutique"
  SOL_investigate_raritys_canterlot_boutique_desc:0 "It appears that [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Carousel is a hive of activity, and that multiple suspects have been seen going there in the last few months. With the latest clues, it's clear that its proprieter, Sassy Saddles, is involved. It is time that she is paid a visit."
  SOL_capture_sassy:0 "Capture Sassy Saddles"
  SOL_capture_sassy_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, Sassy Saddles was "away" on a business trip, which her underlinsg were reluctant to divulge originally. However, we now know that she is in Las Pegasus, ostensibly to broker business deals in the absence of Rarity, but more than likely an attempt to drum up more funding for the Harmonic Resistance. If we strike fast, we can still capture her, and finally learn all we need about the Resistance."
  SOL_destroy_resistance:0 "Crush the Resistance"
  SOL_destroy_resistance_desc:0 "With Sassy finally broken, we have learned the location of the next planned meeting of the different rebel cell heads. Prominent members include herself, Starlight Glimmer, Trixie Lulamoon, Limestone Pie, and others. We shall alert the Empress to this information, and we can expect the full weight of military to come down upon them and finally rid us of rebellion forever!"
  SOL_mop_up_stragglers:0 "Mop Up the Stragglers"
  SOL_mop_up_stragglers_desc:0 "The Harmonic Resistance's leadership has been crushed. There is no chance that another organized insurgency of their influence and strength will rise again. However, they were still able to thwart our stability and order, and there are still some who need to be shown the path of enlightenment. With their leaders imprisoned or killed, it will not be difficult to wipe out what's left of the rabble, and return our lands to peace once more."
  SOL_choose_flagship:0 "Designing the Empress's Flagship"
  SOL_choose_flagship_desc:0 "As our naval doctrines have improved and the underlying technology of warfare has advanced, it's become clear that the old ships that were built before the Empress ascended are no longer adequate for somepony of her stature. It is time that we decide upon what shall bear her name to all the world and stand as a symbol of the Imperial Navy's unmatched might!"

  EQS_project_nightvale:0 "§BProject Nightvale§!"
  EQS_project_astartes:0 "§YProject Astartes§!"
  EQS_project_astartes_desc:0 "Threats to our ponies exist around every corner. Whether it is from their brethren who wish to see the Order of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s Harmony shattered or it is from those who are jealous of our prosperity and security, every day it is a struggle for our survival. While the Empress protects us, she cannot be everywhere at once. Therefore, we must expand who is able to do so. She is the ultimate pony, and nopony else can hope to achieve her levels of perfection. However, that does not mean we cannot try, especially with a few merciful donations."

They do not require sustenance like the faithful does, nor do they need sleep, as they are creatures of darkness and sin. When they perish, their debts will be paid, but until then, they shall labor for us, and provide from the wealth of the earth."

  EQS_repair_temple_of_sun:0 "Repair the Pyramid of the Sun"
  EQS_repair_temple_of_sun_desc:0 "In ancient times, the Neighua ponies worshiped the sun and constructed expansive complexes with towering pyramids, aligned to the solstices and equinoxes. Historical evidence and oral history indicate that sacrifices were performed at these sites, but when contact was made with Equestrian explorers, it eventually fell out of favor when they learned of Celestia's benevolance. Daybreaker is not Celestia, and it is time that they return to their worship of her, for it is only the appropriate response to being ruled by a god."
  SOL_further_flurrys_war_training:0 "Further Firestorm's Training in War"
  SOL_further_flurrys_war_training_desc:0 "As she is still far too young to lead soldiers, Firestorm will be given extensive lessons outside of her normal curriculum, so that she may be one of the chosen leaders of the God-Empress. As an alicorn, she should take to it quite quickly."

  SOL_finalize_with_personal_instruction:0 "Finalize Firestorm's Training Personally"
  SOL_finalize_with_personal_instruction_desc:0 "Since Firestorm began her intensive studies and exercises in all aspects of war, she has become a formidable foe on the battlefield, but there are still many things that can be taught to her, for the God-Empress has not deigned Firestorm worthy of learning many of her own secrets. That shall change, with her last instructions being personal contests between herself and the God-Empress."
  SOL_remove_temporary_laws:0 "Rescind Wartime Measures"
  SOL_remove_temporary_laws_desc:0 "Although they were necessary to ensure smooth transitions to a more orderly society, many of the militarized aspects of some of our wartime laws are beginning to show their inflexibility. Military matters cannot properly deal with civilian problems, and the cudgels used for our defense are now beginning to harm us. We should reimplement some of the old laws until we can move to a fully-realized §Oempire§!."
  SOL_take_flurry:0 "Retrieve Flurry Heart"
  SOL_take_flurry_desc:0 "The Empress's young niece has lived under the influence of weak and impotent tutors from her birth, and Princess Cadance and Shining Armor have done little to further her understanding of the blessing with which she has been bestowed as a natural-birth alicorn. As Daybreaker is concerned for Flurry Heart's education, a visit to inform Cadance of her new home is in order."

  SOL_construct_cathedral_of_sun_desc:0 "[3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] is the center of [ROOT.GetNameDef] and the heart of all ponykind, and as the seat of the Empress's throne, loyal ponies from across the land frequently travel to pay their respects to their guardian. Although there have been attempts in the past to build something to honor Princess Celestia, it was always shut down. But now that the Empress has ascended, she is not averse to being given proper acknowledgement.

While it would need renovating and repairs, it is an excellent building for housing a new branch of the Empress's School for Blessed Unicorns, as numbers in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] are continuing to burgeon, and will soon overfill the school itself if we do not act."

  fancy_albino_sunhorse_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 16th of March, 986 ALB in Vanhoover\n\nBorn to a simple working class family in one of the boroughs of Vanhoover, Arcane Nova was always aware from an early age of the dangers that were present not a couple hundred miles north of the metropolis. From her parents and teachers, the radio and newspapers, the changeling menace was always something that was in the back of her, and many of her generation's minds. Although there never was a changeling infiltration like some ponies in Vanhoover feared, the backdrop of the threat shaped many of her early interests in military strategy. When Queen Chrysalis almost toppled the Equestrian government in 1002, it only further pushed the teen Arcane Nova to apply for every military academy that would potentially take her.\n\nAn appreciation for war in pre-dawn Equestria was looked upon as strange or frightening, but after acceptance into the class of 1005 to Fillydelphia Military Academy, her talent for analyzing combat situations and adapting to unexpected developments became apparent. When she set a new record for holding out in a scenario designed to be an impossible defense, she was transferred to Canterlot's academy to further refine her aptitude to war and war-related magic.\n\nIn the ensuing restructuring of the military after Daybreaker's ascension, her unwavering dedication to guarding Equestria and her astute observations earned her a position within the military science wing of the Solar Empire. When she was summoned by Daybreaker to personally oversee and ensure the loyalty of New Mareland, she was more than eager to prove her abilities to her Empress.\n\nIn New Mareland, she has guaranteed that there is nothing that can be used to question the Empress's decrees. Unrest has been met with disproportionate punishment, and any and all mention to Luna, thestrals, or other creatures of the night have been suppressed. In time, the troublesome colony will become a model subject of the Empress, where the Dawn Star is revered at all times, and all dissidence is eliminated with cauterizing efficiency.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

Although her abilities are unquestioned, her past has been shrouded in more mystery than her superiors would prefer.\n\nAccording to her recruitment file, she grew up in one of the prosperous families of Manehattan, although the only ponies who match her parents' names barely have earned their cutie marks. From her wealthy upbringing, she has had the opportunity to travel abroad, through the lands of Equus, Griffonia, and Zebrica, where she traveled off the beaten path, and practiced remaining unseen to experience the greatest sights. In her interview, she failed to elaborate on specifics of these trips.\n\nHowever, her enigmatic past is overshadowed by her ability to earn results. As an adept at remaining unseen, she has uncovered countless backroom deals in both the political and corporate sphere. On a couple of her reports, she pointed to information in places she never visited and were verified by other agents. How she obtains the details remains another mystery to the rest of her peers. When asked, she merely winks or informs them that it would be spoilers.\n\nShe has lived up to her promises in her initial recruitment. Competent and mysterious, she has yet to fail a mission, no matter where she is sent. Although her flirtatious, and sometimes psychotic behavior has led to fellow agents requesting transfers from operations conducted together, she does, in the end, exemplify the spirit of the Empire's intelligence community.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

Whether it is to hinder nations surrounding the Empire or keeping tabs on the citizens within it, he has either done it before or something close like it.\n\nGrowing up in Vanhoover, Absconditus utilized his wits to his advantage on the streets, when his family at times could barely afford the rent of even the cheapest subsidized housing. Through either subterfuge or guile, he frequently brought home enough food to survive when he wasn't in school, which turned into more elaborate heists as he grew older, leaving him an expert in winding the streets and avoiding undue attention. To him, harmony meant little when his family was destitute.\n\nIt was only when a S.M.I.L.E. agent stationed in Vanhoover as changeling activity became more worrying noticed him that his luck turned. Instead of arrest, as he had almost succeeded in stealing from the agent, he instead was given an offer to assist S.M.I.L.E., which he took, if grudgingly, however, his training was far from finished when the Solar Empire was declared. Within the Empire, his chances of advancement were far greater, as agents defected or were arrested for not bowing the knee to Daybreaker.\n\nAlthough still fresh, he has completely embraced the power and opportunity that the Solar Empire presents. Its idea of retooling harmony into something that works for everypony, instead of only those that are already advantaged, speaks to the wounds still smarting from his life in Vanhoover. Above all else, the order of Daybreaker must be preserved, and he will help guard against it, whenever the chance is given.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§!"
  POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_SOLAR_AGE_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography:§! Since the dawn of pony nations, there have been tales of two sisters, bearing the hallmarks of the three tribes. The magic of unicorns, the strength of earth ponies, and flight of pegasi. From the onset, the eldest took upon herself the greater task of raising the sun to warm and bless all, while the younger raised the moon as a guiding light. These myths morphed and changed each generation, but all pointed to the two sisters, Princesses Celestia and Luna.\n\nLittle is known about their origin, as in the time of the three tribes, they appeared to lead the fledgling nation of Equestria, taking the mantle of the heavenly bodies, and guided all their new subjects into harmony. Through their example, they encouraged everypony to tolerate, love, and care for each other.\n\nTime can sour the strongest relationships, however, and eventually Luna's soul was burdened with jealousy for her sister's recognition. By striking out as Nightmare Moon, she showed the first crack in the otherwise serene and loving diarchs. With Nightmare Moon's banishment, Celestia assumed sole leadership of a broken Equestria, which she healed in time through sweat and tears. For a thousand years, her ponies were protected from all that threatened them by their Princess. No compensation was requested nor expected, as she loved her ponies like a mother does their children.\n\nIn the modern era, countries deride the idea of compassion, and war's onslaught, with the blood, death, and ruin that it brings unveils that the beliefs and ideals of a millennia-old mindset have run their course. Although Celestia tried, Harmony could not be preserved. A mother's love was tested by every lost battle that transpired.\n\nUltimately that love pushed her to new heights. As her ponies suffered, Celestia's purpose changed. Protection came not from the pen, but the sword. Embracing the fires of her wrath, Celestia, now ascended as Daybreaker Sun, reformed the impotent Equestria into an efficient and orderly Empire. While her ponies may protest at the radical and sudden alterations, it is irrelevant. All she needs is a nation ready to lay down its life to guard Harmony from all threats, within and without.\n\n§YPortraits By:§! RyanBoi, Avrameow, and December Breeze"

Although part of a minor family of the Canterlot elite, he rarely speaks of his background as a point of pride. According to him, his parents were rather uninspired and were completely content to remain in their position of wealth and obscurity, but he was not.\n\nAfter studying in Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns with a degree in advanced abdjuration and conjuration magic, he penned a number of papers that ultimately earned the attention of the EEA, where he was made a board member to oversee the quality of magical education within Equestria. Once he was appointed as the new chancellor, various reforms and revisions passed through his office, all of which were instantly approved. While none of his changes were against the ideals of Harmony as advocated by Celestia per se, new red tape for "grade standards" prevented many non-ponies, and event thestrals, from attending any EEA-accredited institution.\n\nWhen Twilight Sparkle opened her School of Friendship, he was quick to vocalize his and the EEA's distrust of the non-ponies allowed to attend, although ultimately he was forced to allow it to operate outside of the EEA when Cozy Glow's plans to siphon all magic from the land was exposed. However, he remains a staunch advocate of the "quality" education that the EEA provides and remains a voice for stricter interaction with outside nations that don't "understand ponykind's needs."§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §Lphp97§!"

As the first of their kind, the subjects that survived the ordeal have been hardened and show little sign of ever faltering in protecting the Empire from internal and external threats. The pedigree does make them somewhat arrogant toward the other legions, but as they were all hoof-trained by the Empress, this confidence is warranted, and leads to them being a cut above many of the other legions that will follow.§!"
  EQS_SOL_history_legio_II:0 "§LThe Dawn Angels are an almost exclusively unicorn legion, both from willing and unwilling subjects. Like Legio I Primaris, Legio II has a number of original test subjects from Project Astartes, although not to the same number. While clothed in the same armor as Primaris and every other legion, they rely less on their magical weapons and more on their innate magic, and can be identified by their pure white plating with orange flares. Blueblood has been offered by Bunsen Beaker and Pinpoint to undergo the process of becoming a Praetorian in order to lead the Dawn Angels, but he has so far steadfastly refused, citing the danger and the potential loss of identity in the creation process.§!"
  EQS_SOL_history_legio_III:0 "§LLegio III is comprised of many pegasi who willingly underwent the process of becoming Praetorian Guards during Project Astartes' final days, with the promise that they could forever serve as guardians of the sky and the Empire. A number of guards within the legion are also former aces or other war heroes, which has made it one of the flashier and more popular legions after the Praetorian Guard was revealed to the populace. Part of the process of becoming Praetorians affects pegasi somewhat differently, which causes many subjects to lose what inhibitions they may have had in battle. Due to this, they frequently fly into the heat of battle, and become drenched in the blood of the Empire's enemies. These feats have earned them the name Blood Ravens, and they have since adopted that color to be their color standard, leading to a terrifying sight on the battlefield.§!"
  EQS_SOL_history_legio_IV:0 "§LLegio IV Sun Sworn is the last of the "pure" legions, as they have a plurality of guards who were earth pony subjects during Project Astartes' development. While they do not have the magic of Legio II or the flight of Legio III, what the Sun Sworn lack in terms of unique features they make up for in bravery and grit. Primaris is frequently tasked with protecting the Empress herself, and the Dawn Angels and Blood Ravens have their tactical advantages. The Sun Sworn are the blunt hammer on the battlefield, and will risk life and limb charging into heavy fire, so that the normal ponies of the Empire may be protected. Ponies that they once were, and wish to see have a life of Order and Harmony.§!"

These additional enchantments require them to be helmeted at all times, as their vision is too sensitive for the day, and their increased agility makes them twitchy, even for the ever-alert Praetorian. Although they are smaller in number compared to other legions, they are just as dedicated to ensuring the Empire stands, and Order and Harmony prevail. They are the unseen saviors, protecting the citizens of the Empire while they sleep, and eliminating any dangers that lurk in the dark.§!"

  SOL_imperial_factory_tour_desc:0 "Before the Empress ascended, she had not seen a working gun model since the first smoothbores were brought back from Griffonia and shown to her.

When Princess Luna returned, there was a clear line of succession if something were to ever happen, but she is not suited to lead our land now, nor would she wish to. In the past, ideas of a regency council have been floated, but every time they were shot down, and [ROOT.GetLeader] has emphatically refused to agree to one for the one thousand years she has led [ROOT.GetNameDef] by her lonesome.\n\nWhile we do not expect her to perish, at the same time, it would be unwise to not have a formalized path in the unlikely event that she is wounded and unable to effectively lead until she heals. Given that Princess Luna's flight has left [ROOT.GetNameDef] in uncertain territory again, the matter should be pressed. It is not as if [ROOT.GetLeader] lacks ponies who know her well and would faithfully serve her, and who could use the power of being the official, designated regent to great effect."

It is like talking with a brick wall. With a beast. They cannot comprehend our goodness, like we cannot stand their debased ways.\n\nWhispers in the morning remind me of my calling.

Benevolence cannot hope to stop the wave of evil that is on the horizon, the foe that wishes to see the utter annihilation of Harmony and destruction of everything for that has been striven for this last millennia.\n\nI will not allow this to be Harmony and Order's last gasp!\n\nOur enemy thinks me stupid, naive, but I have never been sharper.

That troubles could be defused with words and compromise, but I see the truth now. Some are forever lost; anarchists in disguise, wishing to topple the stability that I have brought for a thousand years!\n\nBut I have seen the error of my ways now. Soft calls in the last light of day have reminded me of my purpose: I am here to protect my ponies, even when they do not appreciate it, and do not see what I do. What I see are enemies, within and without, that will stop at nothing to destroy our Order. Our Harmony!\n\nI will never allow this to be our last stand! They may think me weak and ineffectual, but I have never been more resolved!\n\nIn the sun, there is heat. There is security. There is Order!\n\nI shall become all that I was meant to be.

  solarreworked.50.d:0 ""Celestia! I came as fast as I could!" Luna exclaimed as she burst through the door of Celestia's makeshift office, which her sister had commandeered once the war began. As soon as she entered, her breath caught in her throat when she caught the various stacks of papers, reports, and charts that were scattered around the floor. A pair towered almost as high as the ceiling, which made her crane her neck upward to try and see the top of them.\n\n"Celestia?" she inquired. Somewhere buried in the piles of paper, her sister sneezed and a small cloud of paper flew toward the door from the desk in the middle of the room.\n\nWhen Celestia didn't bid her come, Luna rolled her eyes and trotted toward the desk and floated off the pages, which all appeared to be costs and recent casualty reports. "Sister, you must—" Her train of thought halted when she she saw Celestia. The alicorn's eyes were bloodshot, and her fur was tracked with mascara. Even her normally regal mane was completely frazzled and fraying. About a dozen cups of coffee were scattered across the desktop, along with some stains from spilled refills.\n\nLuna smirked.\n\nFinally peering up at her sister, Celestia whimpered, "Don't look at me."\n\n"Then, pray tell, why did you summon me?" calmly prodded Luna as she made her way around the desk.\n\n"I don't know!" Celestia retorted. Crossing her forelegs together, she shifted to avoid looking at Luna. She flinched when Luna rested a forehoof on her shoulder. Neither said anything, and Luna could feel the tension escalating in the room.\n\n"Is something wrong?" Luna gently nudged at last. Celestia shot a glance back at Luna as tears trickled down her cheeks. Luna hissed, while Celestia simply went back to gazing at her hooves.\n\nSwallowing deeply, Luna prodded, "'Tia... you have taken on so much. Mayhap you should—"\n\n"No!" bellowed Celestia, which made Luna's ears flatten in surprise. Celestia blushed. "I-I mean, I can't. They're my ponies, and I have to protect them, and I can't do that if—" Before she could finish, Luna leaned in and pulled Celestia out of the chair and onto the floor.\n\nLuna simply clicked her tongue as she wrapped her wings around Celestia. "You love them, 'Tia, which is why you fret." As tears started streaking down her own muzzle, Luna pulled up Celestia's chin with a wingtip, and she choked out, "But you can't do it on your own. Let me help. Please."\n\nAs she returned to an embrace, she heard Celestia sniffle, "Okay.""

  solarreworked.51.d:0 ""I—I just don't know, Lulu," Celestia sighed tiredly. Outside, she could hear the steady beat of hooves as ponies marched through the command post. It was not far from the front lines, but that was how Luna preferred it. If she wasn't leading her troops directly, she wasn't truly a leader. Celestia simply massaged one of her temples. Black circles ringed her eyes, and her body ached.\n\n"That... is certainly an ordeal, 'Tia," Luna breathed, her eyes tracking Celestia as the princess anxiously got to her hooves and began to pace in the tent. "When was the last time you properly slumbered?"\n\n"I slept last night."\n\n"Was it for more than an hour? I was able to attend to my dream duties last night, and I did not sense your presence in the dream realm." Luna arched a brow inquisitively as Celestia fidgeted. "Perhaps you have spent too much time—"\n\nAbruptly interrupting Luna's statement, a blaring alarm siren pierced the air, which whipped the alicorns' heads outward. Almost immediately afterward, a series of gunshots resounded and Luna sprang up from her desk. Various pictures of her with soldiers or half-finished dream catchers were knocked loose by her sudden movement. "An assault?!" she demanded aloud. "Who would be foalish enough to—"\n\nHer answer was a bullet that whizzed through the tarp, which narrowly avoided grazing Celestia's cheek. The two of them stared at each other for a beat, then Luna's horn ignited in a blue flare, before she charged out of the tent.\n\nPanting heavily, Celestia galloped out after Luna with wobbly legs. She whined when she saw a number of ponies fighting each other, although some of the ones that lost reverted in bright green flashes to their changeling form.\n\nIn the chaos of gunshots and screams, she lost track of Luna. When there was a loud explosion of magic, she quickly darted to Luna's location. She arrived to see Luna standing over three corpses, breathing heavily. However, she was oblivious to a fourth pony who was creeping up on her, knife between his teeth.\n\n"Luna!" she shrieked, just as the disguised changeling pounced. As he landed on Luna, about ready to stab, Celestia roared in fury, and a sudden ball of fire wrapped around the changeling. He batted at himself for a second before scrambling off Luna, and collapsing in a stinking pile of burnt chitin.\n\nWhen her vision cleared, she saw her work, and collapsed, her stomach giving out. She joined the changeling on the ground, the taste of bile in her mouth."

  solarreworked.52.d:0 "Barely containing the fire that was raging in her chest, Princess Luna marched through the hallways of Canterlot Castle. Her peripheral vision was tinged red, and she softly ground her teeth against each other. Every guard that was stationed along her path toward Celestia's chambers dove out of her way. None had to be mind-readers to see the veritable cloud of emotion that was visible on her face.\n\nWhen she arrived at her sister's door, she inhaled deeply and mimicked the technique that Cadance had showed her. Apparently it greatly assisted Twilight whenever she was in a tizzy. After repeating it a few times, she came to one conclusion: it was bunk. If anything, she wanted to plant the hoof she had used through Celestia's wall, and then—\n\nShe cut herself off before it turned into an internal rant. Instead, she rapped heavily on Celestia's door before she barged in. Celestia, her mane rather frizzy and unkempt, jerked up her head at Luna's entrance. She gawked silently.\n\nIn an overly sweet and caring voice, Luna smiled in a saccharine manner and inquired, "Sister, please, perchance, if you could inform Us what possible reason that THOU WOULDST AGREE TO THIS INSANITY?!" Her outburst managed to crack some of the marble around the door's entrance and under her hooves. Furiously, she held out a series of papers, authorizing, with Celestia's seal, a thinly-veiled all out assault on [BUF.GetNameDef].\n\nCelestia simply stared at it for a second, then hastily poured herself a goblet of wine and guzzled it down. She didn't reply. Rather, she started to pour over reports on her desk.\n\n"Dost thou need another reprimand?!" Luna demanded, stomping over to Celestia's desk and slamming the papers approving the "special military operation". "Verily, We didst not conceive that thou wouldst agree to thy warmonger advisors' counsel." Shooting Celestia a glare, she demanded, "Pray tell, what hast thou for thy defense?!"\n\n"Dialect, Lulu," Celestia finally grunted, although she avoided looking at her sister.\n\n"Nay, We shall speak to thee as We wish! What hast possessed thee?! Our sister would never—"\n\n"I don't know!" Celestia barked, making Luna flinch and back. "I-I just felt like... somepony else was controlling me. I—" She gulped back tears. "I don't know..."\n\nSighing, Luna brushed back her mane and stated, "We—I suppose there is one solution. It may save us some embarrassment."

  solarreworked.53.d:0 ""Oh PLEASE, Princess, just because YOU happen to run ONE school that has not completely collapsed without the EEA's direction doesn't mean that you can suddenly dictate national policy!" Chancellor Neighsay spat, his voice echoing through the throne room of Canterlot Castle. Aside from himself and Twilight Sparkle, it was empty. Day Court had been suspended for some time, what with the war going on. From her vantage point on her throne, Celestia stared tiredly at the two of them.\n\nHer head was pounding. Racing around in her skull were thoughts of returning to more important matters, such as writing condolences for families, communicating with sympathetic countries, and directing the war effort. Yet, she would always make time for Twilight, who had requested this audience.\n\nOf course, that decision could have been a mistake.\n\nAt Neighsay's thinly veiled insinuation at her competency, Twilight snorted and ruffled her wings. "Chancellor, as much as I still respect the EEA, I am also required, as the Princess of Friendship, to point out extreme violations of basic ideals of [EQS.GetAdjective] society!" With a small cough, she materialized a large stack of papers, and started flipping through them. "For example, on page seventy-two of the current EEA guidelines, revision seven, on paragraph six, section C—"\n\n"YES, Princess, we both understand that you have read the guidelines." Neighsay gritted his teeth. Barely withholding a smile, Celestia swore that she saw a couple of grey hairs sprout on his head. "Now, do you have a point, about the rules regarding species specific entrances?"\n\n"They're completely degrading!" Twilight barked, throwing the papers away and pointing accusingly at him. "Imagine if I went to [YAL.GetNameDef] and they made me go through—"\n\n"They are safety features!" interjected Neighsay. Marching a couple of steps closer, he growled and his turquoise eyes flashed with fury. "Imagine if a yak or an adult dragon—"\n\n"Safety for whom?!"\n\n"For themselves. For other ponies!" Neighsay rolled his eyes. "Please, Princess, you must understand that they are far larger than us, and—"\n\n"Make all entrances bigger! It's not hard to make everycreature feel welcome and—"\n\n"Maybe we should just calm down?" Celestia stated meekly as she massaged her temples with her front hooves. However, both educators completely ignored her, further delving into the pros and cons of architectural decisions into account for schools.\n\nShe sighed. She should have grabbed a wine bottle, first."

Outside, the din of a thousand conversations of ponies walking about the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] carried in through the open windows and balcony of Celestia's private quarters. "The visit to the Acornage Memorial in fifteen minutes. You're scheduled to speak there for thirty, but if you can cut it down to twenty, we'll have plenty of time to—"\n\nCutting herself off, Raven wiped at her brow, given the rather warm weather conditions of mid-summer, and she sighed as she looked at Celestia. Celestia was restlessly wriggling one of her hindlegs and otherwise listening to the talk down below the castle. Her face was lined with stress, and she hadn't even touched her tea. Or, more impressively, her cake.\n\n"Princess?" inquired Raven as she sipped on her own glass. When Celestia didn't respond, Raven snorted. "Princess!" she repeated, her outburst managing to make Celestia jump in surprise. Raven arched a brow. "I said we have to leave for your speech, and then if we—"\n\n"I-I heard you, Raven," Celestia interjected, her voice low and huffy. Raven merely rolled her eyes. Eyeing her cake, Celestia poked at it and queried, "And what is after presenting a charity check to Countess Coloratura for the displaced fillies orphanage?" Raven could see that she bit her tongue and tensed her jaw. Although Celestia may have been able to hide things from nobles who saw her infrequently, there wasn't a detail that her secretary could miss. Especially when it meant more paperwork.\n\n"What is it?" she asked. She stowed the pencil she had into the nook of her clipboard.\n\nAs Raven adjusted her glasses, Celestia mulled a response. Poking her tongue against her cheek, she finally stuttered, "I-I am merely seeing all those—" She shuddered "—All the ponies I'll have to apologize to. That funeral—"\n\n"It was one soldier. You—"\n\n"No! It was a PONY! One of MY ponies!" Jumping to her hooves, Celestia paced to and fro, and Raven started to automatically stroke off planned events with a sigh. Celestia snarled, "She should have never been on the front lines! My ponies are not safe when—"\n\n"Princess, if I may, I've taken the liberty to cancel all your appearances today, and I will order a second cake from Sugar Cube Corner." Getting up, Raven added as she reached the door. "I'll make a statement that you are indisposed because of an emergency war council session."\n\nTaking a deep breath, Celestia relaxed slightly and muttered, "Thank you, Raven.""

  solarreworked.70.d:0 "When the battlecruiser HMS Golden Dawn and its entourage of screening ships arrived in the harbor of Sunset, the mood was instantly soured, although it was not because of a lack of fanfare. In a matter of fifteen minutes, Jet Set was alerted to the arrival of somepony from [EQS.GetNameDef] and hurried to the pier. His heartreat skyrocketed when he saw a few of his soldiers already there in parade formation.\n\nFor the last couple of minutes, he stood patiently, feeling the sea breeze blowing through his mane and spraying droplets of saltwater onto his glasses. However, he didn't touch them. Not when the unannounced visitor could emerge any moment. He swallowed nervously.\n\nJust as he was about to give into the irritation, there was clanking of gangplanks, and soon one was lowered from the side of the battlecruiser. He stiffened at the sight of a uniformed mare, flanked on either side by guards. For a brief second, she surveyed the pier, then stalked down the gangplank. She disembarked and marched directly in his direction.\n\n"Governor General Jet Set, how kind of you to finally greet me," she spat as she reached him. In an instant, her piercing blue eyes had completely sized him up. Somehow, he could sense that she saw right through him. If there was one thing he noticed about her, was that she was YOUNG. Why would [EQS.GetLeader] send somepony who was so green?\n\nAfter gathering his voice, he merely responded with, "[EQS.Leader] didn't inform me that I should be expecting an—" He coughed "—an honored guest." At that, she lightly tittered.\n\n"How quaint," she retorted with a snort. Momentarily a snarky twinkle appeared in her eyes, and she brushed back her braided mane behind her topcoat. "Why would she announce that you should expect her official representative? You could easily hide damning details."\n\nJet's breath hitched. "I assure you, there is nothing that—"\n\nWaving a hoof dismissively, she strode past him. "Save your platitudes! I'm not an idiot. We shall see if there is a reason to trust your word." She paused. Turning back, she added, "But do be sure that it's a challenge. Certainly more than that pin of the old regime." She nodded at a symbol of the two sisters on his chest.

Cracking an awkward smile, she placed the pot on the small table in their living room. When Daybreaker arched a brow, Posey adjusted her glasses and tittered uneasily. She poured a cup and passed it to Daybreaker, who merely gazed at it for a second before sipping on it.\n\n"Not to be rude, Your Grace, b-but why did you say you came again?" Posey's husband, Gentle Breeze, inquired with a quivering voice. He nervously switched his attention between the two guards that were standing at rapt attention at the entrance to the living room.\n\nAfter taking another drink of her tea, Daybreaker merely looked at him for a moment, then quipped, "Does your Empress require a reason to impose upon her subjects?"\n\n"No! Not at all! I'm merely confused why it would be US?" Gentle glanced between him and his wife. Although it was faint, there was a spark of worry in his eyes, beyond just being in the presence of his better.\n\nBefore Daybreaker could respond, the front door of the Shy's slammed and a carefree, young voice exclaimed, "Yo, Mom! Pops! I'm back from an aching long day. Won't ya come out here and help grab my stuff?" Seconds later, an aquamarine pegasus trotted into the room and gasped. "You're hosting a '"Welcome back, Zephyr" party?!' You shouldn't have!" He shot one glance at Daybreaker. "Heya, Hot Stuff."\n\nBraying indignantly, Daybreaker nodded her head and both guards darted to seize Zephyr. He let out a whinny of surprise, but stated, "You know, if you really like me that much—"\n\n"Silence, foal!" Daybreaker hissed. Bending down to stare him in the eyes, she growled, "As one of the Element Bearers' siblings, ponies look to you, whether you realize it or not."\n\nDaybreaker unfurled a letter. "Normally, draft dodging is below me, but in this case, I'll make an exception."\n\n"N-Now, I'm sure there's an explanation for—" Posey began before Daybreaker glared directly into her soul. She squeaked and went mute.\n\nSquinting, Zephyr inspected the letter while making a low hum. He shrugged, "Sorry, Hot Stuff. Not interested.

  solarreworked.101.d:0 ""Can't believe the nerve of her," Zephyr Breeze grumbled softly as he settled into a nook between a couple of trees. Twelve weeks of basic, just to be thrown a gun and then left out to rot on some smelly battlefield. Did they know how many grains of dirt he'd found underneath his hooves?! More than one! Couldn't even take a Celestia-foresaken nap around his sergeant without getting screamed at.\n\nThankfully no blood had gotten on him yet, but if he had to fight a bug or something with his bayonet, then all that ichor would stain him for months.\n\nSuddenly, a bullet whizzed by his head and broke his reverie. A second later, a couple of screams carried toward him, and he yawned as he tried to drown things out. Apparently there was some battle going on right now, but who cared? He needed to catch up on some zs, and his CO wasn't paying attention right now.\n\nHowever, between the noise of combat and the deep-seated anger he felt from that admittedly looker of an alicorn who hauled him off to boot camp, he could barely get any rest. Cracking an eye open, he grunted when it grew quiet, and he huffed before getting up and checking on the command post, which was nearby. Perhaps one of the nerds there could tell him of a nice hiding spot to snooze away the day.\n\nAfter weaving through a few corridors, which had klaxon sirens blaring, he spotted the quarters of the regiment's general, Cuff Link, and poked his head in. "Heya, General?" he asked, an idea coming to his mind. Nopony was there.\n\nGrinning from ear to ear, he slunk in and poked around in the wardrobe. Sure enough, there was a spare uniform, like he hoped there would be. After quickly donning, he turned around, and screamed when a soldier rushed into the room. However, the soldier saluted, and exclaimed, "General! You were reported killed in battle. What are you doing here?!"\n\nZephyr's mind raced. Sweat trickled down his neck. Stuttering, he fibbed, "W-Well, that's obviously because somepony who LOOKED like me was killed. I was here the entire time. Definitely." He cracked an uneasy smile.\n\nPanic etched into his face, the soldier grabbed him without questioning the lie. "Part of the line has been broken! We need you to direct its regrouping!" Before Zephyr could protest, he was grabbed by a hoof, and pulled toward the communications room. Zephyr could only sigh."

In only a few weeks, he had completely transformed that stuffy, old room that the geezer before him had used into a hip and fun place. A few pictures—of himself, of course—an icebox with a selection of various ciders, and a pool table. Could still use a few more amenities, but it was a start.\n\nOutside his office, he could hear ponies rushing to and fro, and one mare quickly poked her head in to inquire, "Have you finished, General?"\n\n"Hm?" Zephyr cracked an eyelid open. "Oh, yeah, yeah!" Swiping a single page from his desk, which he spent all of maybe two seconds reading, he tossed it toward her. From the title, he thought it might have been something about fireworks, or the like.Something with some big booms. Maybe they were all using those giant guns a couple miles away for a show later.\n\n"What about the inventory reports on our current medical supplies?" the aide asked as she took the page in her magic.\n\n"Oh, uh, I gave that to Corporal, uh, Smudge or something," Zephyr mumbled as he started to slip back into sleep. Yawning, he muttered, "You know, delegation is key to success!" He spread his wings to stretch them, then waved her off. "You can go now. I'm just going to, uh, think on some new battle plans. Yeah!"\n\nDutifully, the mare left and his door clicked shut. For a few minutes, the hustle and bustle continued outside, but it soon grew disturbingly quiet as a few sets of hooves stomped toward his office. As the door slammed open, he sighed, "Yo, what'd I tell you about—"\n\nAs his vision cleared, he froze when he saw a unicorn with the exact same fur and mane color as him glowering at him, while standing between two guards, who were also looking outraged. The double, who was probably about fifteen years older, was missing part of an ear, and had a large gauze patch over half his face and neck. He wore a general's uniform.\n\nZephyr gulped. "Ah, General Link! I-I heard that you were KIA. But, uh, I see I was wrong." As the general's glower deepened, Zephyr spied the window in the office, and tensed. "I'd love to chat, but, uh, I kept your seat warm, and uh, I think I'll be going!" Leaping for the window, he punched through the glass, and was soon nothing more than a distant speck on the horizon."

With her station set along one of the few small settlements of [CRY.GetNameDef], she had a relatively quiet position. In the past, there had been an odd incident or two of an accused changeling infiltrator, before it was determined that it was just a unicorn with a mild allergy to magic. There was even a bugbear once, but it was being directed by Fluttershy to a safe nesting location, so it wasn't much of a threat.\n\nTherefore, when she caught some movement in the sky on her way back to her station for the evening, she frowned. Readying her rifle, she took aim and traced it as it grew larger. Soon enough, she could see it was a lanky pegasus. Since she was concealed by some of the shrubs in the wooded area near the town, she could watch him as he approached.\n\nHe seemed to be fleeing. Every so often, he'd glance over his shoulders like he was being pursued, but he wasn't being followed, from what she could see. When he was about three hundred feet out and above her, she stepped and called, "Halt! You're entering [CRY.GetAdjective] territory!" He screamed with a haggard gasp and noticed her. She held her gun at the ready.\n\nFreezing and looking at her gun, he obeyed and descended. When his hooves touched the earth, he collapsed and began to kiss it. "Thank Celestia!" he exclaimed when he stopped. "Finally somepony to help me!" Before Refraction could ask him anything, he grabbed both her shoulders and shook her. "They're after me! I-I barely made it out! I know they're hunting little ol' me!"\n\nShe pushed him back. Arching a brow, she demanded, "Who's hunting you?" Now that she was closer, she could tell he was wearing a rather sweat-drenched uniform of an [EQS.GetAdjective] officer. "Wait," she began. "Are you an [EQS.GetAdjective] soldier?" She tightened her grip on her rifle.\n\nFor a second, he blinked at her, and then he bobbed his head up and down frantically. "Y-Yeah, totally! Five star gen-er-RAL!" He fluttered his lashes at her innocently. "They were cramping my style, so I said, 'No thanks, buckos!' and then they just started chasing me!" He hopped up. "Super important pony, after all." He shot her a smug grin. "Probably sent a whole army after me."\n\n"Right..." she muttered. "Well, it'll have to be verified, but if you're an [EQS.GetAdjective] general..."

Then she heard a loud, long slurp as the other pony—correction, one of the other ponies—guzzled HER coffee. She snarled.\n\nWhen his eyes locked with hers, he stopped mid-slurp and just looked at her. He wiggled his eyebrows playfully.\n\n"Private, is there a reason you're still in here with your—" Petal eyed him again "—your general?"\n\n"Don't worry about her, Glitter Glow—"\n\n"That isn't even close to my name."\n\n"Whatever."

Not that he really seemed to treat the offices of [CRY.GetAgency]'s with much respect. Or really the offices of anything in [CRY.GetNameDef] that well, from what she saw on her clipboard.\n\nIf it weren't because he was, from what they could verify, a general in [EQS.GetNameDef]'s military, he would have probably been looking at a dishonorable discharge, at best.\n\nWith a long, exasperated sigh, she rubbed her temples for a second or two, then looked at her clipboard. She had to double check his name. Zephyr Sneeze. Straightening her papers, she asked him, "General, if we may begin?"\n\n"Hmm?" he inquired, as he was looking at one of the rank stripes on his [CRY.GetAdjective] uniform. "Oh, sure, shiny stuff.

"All right, so, now that we finally have the bandwidth, what can you tell us about some of [EQS.GetLeader]'s battle plans? Troop compositions? Research projects?"

Between all the uhs, ahs, ums, and wells, he did get out that they picked up the [CRY.GetAdjective] officer up right on the border. Apparently, he was staggering around, and claimed he hadn't had a drink of water in seven weeks, which was simply absurd. Also, when he had seen it was a [STG.GetAdjective] patrol, he then started saying all he needed was vodka. And also began speaking in a thick, stereotypical, [STG.GetAdjective] accent.\n\n"Right," Kirov grunted as he dismissed the peon. By now, they had gotten to the outpost's one interrogation room, and he began to observe the prisoner from behind the one-way mirror. Certainly, he appeared to be a [CRY.GetAdjective] officer, given the rather ragged uniform which he was wearing. Still, he was an Equestrian, given the complete lack of crystal shine. Those were rare.\n\nScratching his chin, Kirov huffed and brushed back some of his dark blue mane before entering. As soon as the officer heard him enter, the stallion ran to him and begged, "Please! I need some hoof trimmers. Poor ol' me hasn't have a good hooficure in AGES!" He coughed. Suddenly in a thick, movie-like accent, he also inquired, "Uh, and comrade, get me an entire bottle of wodka. Da?"\n\nKirov glowered at him.\n\nCoughing into a hoof, the stallion tittered, "W-Well, ah, I thought that'd go better in my head."\n\nIn perfect Equestrian, with little inflection, Kirov grunted, "I speak your language fine, capitalist lackey. Do not insult my intelligence."\n\n"O-Oh, buddy, I'm not ANYPONY'S lackey," he stated while wrapping a hoof around Kirov's neck. "You know, I always said, 'Zephyr uh... Cheese, don't let nopony cramp yer style,' and I am one free soul!" He smiled widely at Kirov and added, "Totally thought outside the box and just—" He whistled and whipped his hoof up high.

Slowly, the light cloud that he had brought down to his humble lean-to fluttered in a light, warm wind. For the first time in he didn't know how long, he was finally at peace.\n\nSure, his parents probably thought he was dead. Fluttershy was worried sick about him, and Rainbow Dash was probably beside herself in hysterics about the thought of never seeing him again, but he was at least safe. No more risk of ruining his perfectly maintained hooves with blood. No more fraying clothes making him feel icky—although he did have a nice collection of medals from his adventures—and no more being bossed around.\n\nHe was the boss of his own life now!\n\nIf he had to reflect on the last few years, it'd be one of contentment. And theft, but he didn't need to think about that. It was more like "permanent borrowing" of food, anyway. It meant he could lounge around thinking and soaking up the sun, since staying so far outside of any civilization meant that the risk of being found by... HER were slim to none.\n\nAs he briefly envisioned that fiery alicorn, he shivered. Sure, she was hot—literally—but being taken back to that army again? No thanks.\n\nScreaming, he leapt out of his cloud as his reverie was shattered by an earth-shaking explosion. In the distance, a shower of dust and smoke filled the air, and more soon followed. Within short order, some soldiers of [BAT.GetNameDef] took to the air. Soon, even more started fleeing in the opposite direction of the blasts.\n\nHowever, as he was about to lie back down, a chill zipped down his spine as he saw few new soldiers march forwrad. It was [EQS.GetNameDef]! He could recognize those white uniforms anywhere.\n\nQuivering, he froze on the spot, then gasped. In a burst of blood-red magic, a tall, imposing figure appeared in front of some troops. Her armor glinted in the sunlight, and her fiery mane raged against the backdrop of the earth. Daybreaker was here! She was looking right at him!\n\nShe'd come for him!\n\nYears of repressed fear seizing him in an instant, Zephyr shrieked and peeled off into the sky. At his speed and distance, he failed to notice Daybreaker's confused frown as he disappeared from view, forever running from the pony who would have him fight."

  solarreworked.120.d:0 "Stalking through the radiant halls of the Kaiserschloss of Griffenheim, Daybreaker could barely withhold a self-satisfied smirk from breaking across her muzzle. It was a sweet irony, to see [GRD.GetNameDef] rise by the point of a sword, only for it to come crumbling down from years of decay, undermining, and politics. Even its resurgence, which she had to admit, wasn't entirely expected, was clearly a last gasp by a dying creature.\n\nAs if to emphasize her thoughts, she saw a grand, sprawling mural of Grover II, depicting his various campaigns across the continent. Conveniently, it ignored the fact that it was a pony who ended the fool. She merely held back a chuckle at it. If Grover II was alive, he would have been appalled at the resplendent lives of his descendants. True, he led life as a noble, but he had been a warrior at heart.\n\nWith her entertainment quota fulfilled, she marched toward her objective: the doors to the young Grover's chambers. She nodded to her two guards that were stationed on either side of them, and she entered. Already, her magic was readied for a surprise attack, but none came. Instead, Grover merely sat by his window. When she entered, he closed his book he was reading and readjusted his glasses.\n\n"What do you want?" he demanded rather testily in a faint Griffenheim accent. A few molting feathers fell off his adolescent face. "You have already bested us. Do you wish to kill me?" He straightened and puffed out his chest, but she could see him quiver faintly in fear. "You won't find me groveling for mercy."\n\nBearing her fangs and chortling, Daybreaker shook her head and clucked, "No, no, my little... griffon. You misunderstand my intentions."\n\n"Really? I have read the reports on what has happened in Equestria," Grover responded with a huff. Daybreaker suppressed a snarl at the mention of her nation's old name.\n\n"What's happened in MY EMPIRE is none of your concern." Trotting closer to him and letting her mane flap about and bathe his chambers in an orange glow, she stated, "But you shall learn in time that my decisions were only for my ponies' protection." As he flared his wings defensively, she sneered and added, "You shall learn much from me."\n\n"Where is [GetGriffonRegent]?!" he demanded. "If [GRD.GetLeader.GetSheHe] has been harmed, I'll—"\n\n"[GRI.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] is... indisposed, little griff," Daybreaker chortled. Batting away a single swipe of his claws as she reached out, she placed a forehoof on his head as a parent would pat their foal and stated, "Don't worry. You'll soon come to think of me as an aunt. I will be all the family you need.""

  solarreworked.121.d:0 "The Sun rose high upon the ancient city of Griffonstone. Amidst the cobbled streets and winding alleyways of the homeland of the griffons, a varied procession of ponies and griffons marched toward the ceremonial coronation hall, formerly the kingly palace of Grover I, and later, of his blood relatives, the Gutos, which reached up to the heavens above the other, destitute buildings of the old metropolis, cutting like a gleaming knife through hot butter.\n\nAlthough the procession itself was a rather proud affair, none of the griffons that had been assembled to spectate made noise. Interspersed throughout, easily noticeable by the wake they created, armed pony soldiers, dressed in brilliant white parade uniform, watched for signs of dissent.\n\nIn the middle of the procession, Daybreaker slowly, haughtily, cantered. For once, instead of wearing her armor, she was adorned in a shimmering golden gown, which trailed behind her and was kept clean through various enchantments. Casting her gaze around her observers, she only sneered in amused contempt at their searing glares. Whatever they thought mattered not, for soon they would be able to question her even less than they already could.\n\nIn only a couple of minutes, the parade had finally reached the entrance to the coronation hall, the pillars of which glistened in the noonday sun. Briefly, Daybreaker remained stationary at the steps of the hall, looking back at the statue of Grover I that they had passed. Its chipped and eroded made her chuckle. Such a fitting picture of an aging empire.\n\nInside the hall, the domed roof permitted the full display of the Sun's beauty to come through. Ahead of the ceremony, perfectly clear crystal chalices, chandeliers, and every other item that could be conceived were set up for the noble guests. She barely registered it, though, as she suppressed a cackle when she saw Grover VI and his regent, [GRD.GetLeader], along with one of the Griffonstone nobles, waiting for her on the dais.\n\nSauntering her way toward the dais after waiting for the choir of griffons to be convinced to pronounce her entrance, she nodded once to the noble, and merely shot Grover a self-assured smirk. Surprisingly, the young griff remained restrained, and kept his face from displaying any emotion. However, she could see in his eyes that he was fighting between furious, combative, and resigned.\n\nIt didn't take long for her goal to be retrieved. The glimmering crown of the Grovers soon was escorted toward the dais, and she bore her teeth in delight. With a single sigh, she took it, placed it upon her head, and waited.\n\nThe only applause she received was dead silence."

  solarreworked.122.d:0 ""I am not going to repeat myself again, griff," Daybreaker huffed as she sat across the other side of the dining table in one of the private rooms of the Kaiserschloss. "I will force feed you if it comes to it." Grover didn't bother replying, though, as he continued to just listlessly fiddle with one of the pieces of food on his plate.\n\n"And if I refuse?" he muttered in response, giving Daybreaker a side-eye and munching on one of the pieces of liver that was displayed on the plate. "You'll finally kill me, like I thought all along?"\n\nDaybreaker rolled her eyes. Finishing her salad, she huffed, "Preposterous! I would have no reason!"\n\n"Other than being a bloodthirsty murderer?" retorted Grover, which earned a raised eyebrow from her. "Do not intend to lie to me about what goes on in Equestria. Your toadies that you leave in your place while you're away blab even when I'm around." He snorted. "They must believe I'm still a chick."\n\n"Bold of you to tell me you spy on conversations that don't concern you," Daybreaker snarled, her mane momentarily flaring a slightly hotter yellow. However, Grover didn't flinch, and the additional light and heat from her soon dissipated. Pushing aside a couple of scrolls which she had been reading in between spurts of conversation, she stated, "But I'm feeling benevolent today."\n\n"How exciting." Grover returned to reading his book, his plate mostly uneaten.\n\nGritting her teeth, Daybreaker grunted, "If you are so curious regarding the state of my empire, then you will begin your education now."\n\n"You do realize that I've been receiving tutelage for over a decade now, no? My education—"\n\n"Is not sufficient," she cut in as she waltzed toward him. In her magic, she brought both her scrollsdropped them into his lap. "Read them. Give me your ruling," she ordered, her tone harsh and commanding.\n\nMomentarily, he stared at her, the faintest hint of fear revealing itself in his raised hackles. He scanned the scrolls. From what he could tell, they were two reports of captured prisoners, one from [EQS.GetNameDef], one from [GRD.GetNameDef].\n\n"The value stolen isn't much. I would... probably give them a small sentence and then release them," he stated. As there was a burst of flame from the liver on his plate, he jumped in shock.\n\n"Incorrect. They will both steal again. The pony has been captured on thirteen charges, the griffon has been in your jails three times." With a smarmy grin, she inquired, "It appears you need a better education after all, don't you think?""

  solarreworked.124.d:0 "Golden sunlight poured through the perfectly clear, crystal windows of the throne room within the Kaiserschloss, bouncing off the marble pillars and imparting a regal hue to any and all those that stood within. Stationed at the entrance to the throne room, as well as on either side of the dais up to the throne, [EQS.GetAdjective] soldiers stood rigidly at attention, potentially more than usual, given that they were within the presence of their Empress.\n\nIn Grover's mind, he couldn't imagine the last time they were this on edge. Even other times that Daybreaker had visited for her duties as regent, she didn't instill as much fear as he saw in them now. As he adjusted his glasses, he studied one of the soldiers closely, noting many of the hidden emotions that were forcing their way out. Subtle cues: tightened jaw, slight working of the teeth, a small fidget in the left hind leg. All indicated that, not only was this pony fearful, he was furious. Most likely upset at being stationed here, not that he'd admit it near his Empress.\n\nAs his mind wandered, he was broken from his observation as Daybreaker cast a small field of magic on some of his hackles, and he growled testily. She straightened them out and grunted, "Silence. I do not wish to be here any more than you do, griff."\n\n"And you did not need to attend, pony," he grumbled in return as she fixed a slight crease in his uniform. When she finished, he huffed and brushed off the topcoat which he wore, which clinked with a few medals that he'd yet to actually earn. Meanwhile, she was gowned in a fire orange dress, and eschewed her normal regalia. In front of them both, a trembling griffon who was hurriedly setting up various mirrors near a camera to reflect the light darted glanced at them occasionally.\n\nDaybreaker scoffed at his statement. "I am your regent. I believe I deserve to be acknowledged."\n\n"I am old enough to—"\n\n"Enough babbling," she interrupted with a hiss, which only earned a glare from him. "This matter is settled. The Empire must see its rulers."\n\n"Or its ruler and her puppet," he quipped back as the photographer motioned for them to stand back. When they were lined up with the throne to create a background with it between them, the griffon made them stop, and Grover furrowed his brow.\n\n"Smile, griff," Daybreaker hissed, just as they were both blinded by the flash of the camera.\n\nHe didn't comply."

  solarreworked.203.d:0 "A cold chill ran down Daybreaker's spine as she watched Flurry Heart twist and whirl through some of her training exercises. Dodge, weave, unleash magic bolt, repeat. Every single one of her targets, various prisoners from rebel camps that had yet to be properly dealt with, fell to her advances. Despite her lithe form, which belied some of her innate, alicorn strength, she dove at one of the nearby, fleeing ponies, who was banging on the door out of the training room.\n\nAs a chime of magic echoed through the arena, there was an agonizing screech, and then it went silent. Slowly, the lights to the room dimmed, and there was a single, light click as the latch to the door was released, by a simple twist by Daybreaker's magic.\n\nIn a burst of light, Daybreaker teleported to the other side of the door, and opened it, revealing Flurry, who was heaving over the charred body of the rebel. She continued to stare at it for a moment, emotions running rampant in her eyes, switching rapidly between rage, confusion, anger, hurt, fear, and shock. While her breaths continued in staccato bursts, she finally got off of the body and staggered on wobbly legs toward Daybreaker.\n\n"You succeeded," Daybreaker stated matter-of-factly. Masking a fake yawn by placing a hoof over her muzzle, she concealed a grin as Flurry collapsed in a heap in front of her.\n\n"I—I—I—" she stammered a few times.\n\n"You succeeded," repeated Daybreaker, stepping forward and resting a hoof on Flurry's shoulder. The young mare looked at Daybreaker, tears welling up as she gazed into her aunt's eyes. "You did not hesitate. You took charge. Like an alicorn must." At Flurry's nod, she smiled. "Tell me: what did you feel?"\n\n"I... felt... furious. Everypony there was a danger to [EQS.GetNameDef]. A danger to you! To me!" At that, Flurry pushed herself back up. "I-If they could coordinate, they could have attacked you!" Realization clearly dawning on her, the dam of emotions broke and she sobbed, "I can't let them hurt you! I can't let them hurt me!" Only a couple of sniffs escaped her nose before she screamed, "I'll break them all!"\n\nAs Flurry wailed, Daybreaker smirked.\n\nShe had finally learned."

  solarreworked.205.d:0 "Encapsulated in one of the specially-designed dungeons of the castle in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Sunset Shimmer sulked on her cot within her cell. Trying to escape with magic was useless, as this had clearly been created to hold powerful mages. Although faint, the memory of Celestia stating as much, and about how they were almost never used, returned to her mind. As soon as it did, her throat caught and she choked back a couple of sniffs.\n\nIt didn't also help that her horn had been locked down with an inhibitor ring.\n\nShe flicked her ear when a scratching on the door's lock caught her attention. On the other side of the bars, two guards, dressed in full parade uniform, stood on either side, while a third unlatched the door. Seconds later, he stepped away, and Sunset's throat latched itself shut.\n\nEntering the room with a confident sashay, Daybreaker performed a cursory inspection of the cell, and then looked to Sunset. "Hello, my long lost—"\n\n"No!" Sunset interjected, shaking her head and crawling back a few paces. "Don't even say that! You aren't Celestia! Don't even try!"\n\nA pained frown fell upon Daybreaker's muzzle, and she shook her head. "My dearest Sunset, I'm just as much her as she is me." Stepping forward, she reached out a forehoof to cup one of Sunset's cheeks, although it was quickly batted away as Sunset retreated further into the cell. Daybreaker didn't pursue. Rather, she arched an eyebrow. "Tell me, why did you not return earlier to help me?"\n\n"I didn't come to help you!" Sunset barked back. Although she managed to keep a straight face, her chest burned with emotion, and she blinked back tears. "I came to help Equestria! To help Twilight!"\n\n"Oh, yes, Twilight." Daybreaker grinned. "But not for me? If so, then why did it take a war to bring you? If you cared more for my Empire and for Twilight, what was preventing you from volunteering for their sake sooner?"\n\n"I—"\n\n"I think that it is more than that, and we're going to spend a bit of time determining what." Again, Daybreaker stepped forward, her radiant mane illuminating the entire cell as she did so. When she was only a few feet away, Sunset attempted to dart past her, but Daybreaker merely grabbed her in a telekinetic field. "Come, my long lost student, I think it's time we aired our grievances.""

  solarreworked.206.d:0 ""Tell me, Sunset, what truly motivated you?" Daybreaker inquired as she sat Sunset down on her cot. With a look of concern, she stood over the unicorn, and motioned for her guards to close the door. It latched with a click. "You were always so ambitious, yet, driven by emotion." Cracking a smirk, she added, "I recall when you attempted to break into one of the—"\n\n"Shut up!" Sunset bellowed as she flattened her ears against her skull and spun away from Daybreaker. "Those aren't your memories! Y-You're just trying to get into my head!" Despite her emphatic declaration, a couple of tears managed to trickle down her muzzle. "There's nothing you can say that will make me believe you!"\n\n"Then how about this?" Daybreaker inquired. She stepped back. As if reflecting a calmer state of mind, her mane's steady, rhythmic waving in an ethereal wind slowed, and the bright orange flame darkened to a blood red. Placing a hoof to her peytral, Daybreaker stated, "I forgive you."\n\nSunset jerked her head around. Although she didn't say anything, Daybreaker could see some of the fire leave her eyes. In return, a spark of curiosity was quickly extinguished by a renewed anger, and Sunset crossed her forehooves and looked away again.\n\n"You heard correctly, Sunset Shimmer, my former student." Since Sunset didn't cut her off, Daybreaker bared her fangs in a sneer and stated, "Just like I forgive all those who truly repent of their rebellion against me."\n\n"Yes, because THAT'S happened so far."\n\n"Do you think me a monster, Sunset?" Daybreaker glanced over her shoulder as she trotted to the one, small window looking out of the cell into the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. "Am I so different from you? From everything Twilight told me, did you not decide you knew what was best for those creatures on the other side of the portal? Did you listen to their needs? Did you understand their wants?"\n\nSunset's expression darkened. "What I did was wrong! I controlled them! Forced them to do my bidding!"\n\n"Ah, but some followed you willingly, did they not? Is that no different from what I must do? Ponies do not always know what is best for them, yet they can be convinced to follow those who do. If you were to go free, would you fight against every one that believes in me? How many would you have to kill to declare that 'evil' has been defeated?"\n\nDaybreaker turned and leaned toward Sunset. "How many until you felt accepted?""

  solarreworked.207.d:0 ""If you were to battle your way through every one of my loyal subjects, what then?" As Daybreaker effectively leered over Sunset, Sunset's posture slumped, and she started to work her jaw nervously. Instead of defiance or anger, her ears were pressed against her head in despair. Steady tears trickled down her muzzle and stained the simple sheets of the cot.\n\nSitting down to be at eye level with Sunset, Daybreaker gently reached underneath Sunset's chin and pulled it up. Sunset's eyes met with hers momentarily, then Sunset jerked away again. Still, the unicorn was clearly fighting back sobs, and she pulled her forelegs close to her chest before scooting back on the bed.\n\n"No answer?" prodded Daybreaker. Closing her eyes, she sighed, "If you were to defeat me? Where would that lead you? Would ponies accept you? Would they see that you did what you did for 'their good'? Would you not simply be imposing your will on them, like you did with the creatures beyond the portal?"\n\n"No... I... would do it out of... love for them." Sunset wiped at her nose.\n\n"And you think I do not love them?" For a second time, the cocky grin that was on Daybreaker's muzzle broke and she solemnly gazed at Sunset. "Do you not think I do this all for them? Am I not the one who is protecting them? From Chrysalis, or [STG.GetLeader], [WNG.GetLeader], Sombra, Tirek, or others? From themselves?"\n\n"I..."\n\nDaybreaker stretched out a hoof. As her reach was far longer, she was able to pull Sunset toward her, and soon pressed her into a tight embrace. Wrapping her wings around Sunset, she stated, "Sunset, my Sunset, you do not have to keep fighting. You do not have to keep seeking approval, whether from Twilight, Equestria, or anypony else. You have a home here.\n\n"You can choose to protect Harmony, like I do for my ponies. You can be accepted for who you are. You don't have to keep wandering, thinking only of your guilt." Daybreaker gently ran a forehoof up and down Sunset's back. "Did you not express how you wished the family you never had back in Tall Tale? You can have that here. You can have all of that, if you help me shield Equestria and Harmony from danger."\n\nSuddenly, whatever was holding Sunset back shattered, and she began sobbing into Daybreaker's fur. As the broken mare's tears soaked Daybreaker's skin, Daybreaker's muzzle twisted into a self-satisfied grin."

  solarreworked.208.d:0 ""I—" Sunset Shimmer began, before her words choked on her tears and she buried her head further into Daybreaker's chest. Gripping one limply onto Daybreaker's other foreleg, she attempted to force back a few coughs and sputters, while Daybreaker continued to shush her while rubbing her back. "I just want... everypony to be safe."\n\n"As do I, Sunset, yet what you thought was the right way would only lead them into more danger. Do you not see that now?" Daybreaker inquired, momentarily leaving the warm hug and wiping away a couple of Sunset's tears. "Do you not see that ponies like us must guide them to safe pastures, whether they agree with it or not?"\n\nWith Sunset's silence, barring the uneasy working of her jaw, Daybreaker clicked her tongue like a chiding, concerned mother, and pulled Sunset back into the embrace. "You do not have to fight any longer. Your journey has come to an end. You're home. Truly home."\n\n"B-But what you want... it isn't me... it's my past. My past isn't my today. I—" Sunset coughed and choked again, before a few hiccups racked her body. With a comforting "shhh," Daybreaker began to softly play her wings along Sunset's back and head. Slowly, the sobs came to a stop, and Sunset stammered, "W-What can be done?"\n\n"You will assist me. You will help everypony who aids me."\n\nLeaving the embrace, Daybreaker stood and patiently left a forehoof out for Sunset to take. Sunset eyed it sullenly, then reached for it. She paused for a second. One last, weak flame of resistance flashed in her eyes, then she sighed. In defeat, she wrapped one of her own forehooves around Daybreaker, and wobbingly stood up.\n\n"I don't know what—"\n\n"Don't say anything, Sunset. You will make me proud." Daybreaker clamped a wing on Sunset's shoulder. "But from henceforth, you are a new pony. Together, Dawnbreak Shimmer, you and I shall preserve Harmony." She squeezed tighter on Sunset's shoulder. "You are home.""

From—" Twilight cut herself off in a couple of sniffs. From where Daybreaker stood, now again impassive and observing her former student, she could see tears glistening in the light streaming in through the stained glass windows.\n\n"But you would," Daybreaker emphasized, keeping her voice calm and collected as she sauntered ever nearer to Twilight. What little bit of fire that had reignited itself within Twilight was quickly flickering and perishing. It would only take a little push to snuff it out permanently.\n\nNow only a couple of inches away from her, Daybreaker simply stated, "Twilight."\n\nFor a moment, Twilight didn't look up, but when she did, her eyes were bloodshot, and she blinked a few times as Daybreaker's mane reflected in her pupils. Dark tracts had been carved into her fur where her tears had stained them. With every passing second, fear, pain, and confusion grew more evident upon the young alicorn's face.\n\nDaybreaker shook her, like a doting mother. "Twilight, Twilight, Twilight. My faithful student." She reassuringly placed a hoof upon Twilight's head, and Twilight flinched. However, with her chains keeping her in place, she could only whine a couple of times while Daybreaker applied a smidgen more pressure for comfort. Daybreaker sighed. "Did you know that you were my pride? I could always count upon you to the correct thing. To put Harmony above all else."\n\n"I... I..."\n\n"Yet you're continuing to fight against Harmony's will." Daybreaker traced her hoof to be below Twilight's chin, and craned it up so they were looking at each other. "You're lost. Confused. The answers you seek are here. You must simply open your eyes." Warmly smiling, she leaned down slightly and nuzzled Twilight.\n\nTwilight winced, but she asked, "H-How can anypony be helped?"\n\nHer grin expanding further, Daybreaker used her magic to unlatch the chains, and extended a hoof to help Twilight stand. "By leading by example. By showing them what true Harmony is. By guiding them in my Order."\n\nCowering back from Daybreaker's hoof temporarily, Twilight hesitantly took it, and raised herself to her hooves. "What about ponies who don't want to follow?"\n\nDaybreaker's eyes flashed with fire. "Then they shall be enlightened. And you shall enlighten them, Sunrise Sparkle.""

Practically being shoved in by a couple of guards, Cadance grunted and flared her wings aggressively, however, she could do little in account of inhibitor ring placed around her horn.\n\nDaybreaker smirked.\n\n"It wasn't like I had much choice," Cadance grumbled as her wings folded back against her sides. Looking up at her horn, she snarled, "Although I'm surprised that they're keeping me in here alone, when I could use this—"\n\n"Please, it's not in your nature. Besides—" Daybreaker forced back a yawn as she put away her book. A book on relational advice. "—I could easily incinerate you where you stand before you could think." Quirking her lips upward in a sneer, she tittered, "So don't try it."\n\n"Did you call me here, just to make fun of me?! Aren't you happy enough, corrupting Celestia like you did?! Haven't you already made Harmony a mockery?" As a lock of her mane fell in front of her face, Cadance growled. "Didn't you already make your point clear when you 'visited' us?"\n\n"Can't an aunt want to spend more time with her niece?" Daybreaker countered, visibly brushing off every accusation with a dismissive wave of a forehoof. Stepping around her desk, Daybreaker practically stalked forward, her eyes glowing in interest. "Should I not wish for us to mend our relationship?"\n\n"Never!" spat Cadance. With each advance Daybreaker made, she retreated in kind, and occasionally checked her back to ensure she wouldn't be cornered. "You're a monster! You're no better than Sombra!"\n\nAt that, Daybreaker paused, and she shook her head and tsked. Pain on her face, Daybreaker inquired, "Do you really think that of me?" Cadance's glower was all that Daybreaker needed. "I suppose you do. What do you propose, Cady?"\n\n"Don't call me that! You don't have a right to—"\n\n"I am your aunt!" Pressing a forehoof onto her chest, Daybreaker stepped forward again, a hurt expression on her muzzle. "I do what I must for my ponies out of love, yet YOU have the gall to call me the monster!

Assessing Cadance, she watched as Cadance took another couple of steps backward, but bumped quickly into the wall of Daybreaker's quarters. "If I am such a monster, what would it involve to rid my ponies of myself? Would my ponies even want that?"\n\n"I-I know there must!" Cadance pursed her lips. However, between the wall and the narrowing distance between her and Daybreaker, she didn't really have room to flee. "There will always be ponies who fight against tyrants like you!"\n\n"'Tyrants?'" Daybreaker inquired, her eyes flashing with curiosity. Stopping and standing straight, she tilted her head and repeated, "'Tyrants,' hmm? What if I'm not seen as a tyrant? What if I'm adored? What if ponies follow me out of the strength I provide and the protection I offer? What then?"\n\nCadance bit her lip. Advancing closer still, Daybreaker prodded with a matronly tone, "What then, Cadance?"\n\n"Y-You'd be controlling them! Through fear, or, or through magic, or—"\n\n"I lead through power!" Briefly, Daybreaker's mane flashed a brighter, hotter blue, and she bared her teeth, but it quickly faded. "What makes you believe that my ponies have been coerced? As you arrived, you must have seen how they praise me. Would that do that with you, if you overthrew me?"\n\n"I never—"\n\n"Would you earn their support, or would you have to force them to love you? What would you do if you large groups refused to follow you? Would you strike them down for stability? Would you enchant them to long for your orders? Is that not what Sombra would have done?" Daybreaker's expression grew dourer. As a couple of tears started to glisten in Cadance's eyes, Daybreaker got within hoof's reach. Reaching out and forward with a wing, she gently touched Cadance's shoulder and asked, "Would he not have forced everypony to follow him, whether they wanted to or not?"\n\n"I... that's not..."\n\n"But you would have to. Destroying me would lead to destruction of Equestria and Harmony. What then?" When Cadance remained silent, Daybreaker withdrew her wing and turned. She heard Cadance slump to the floor, and grinned."
  solarreworked.211.a:0 "What else, my niece?"
  solarreworked.212.t:0 "The Selfish Niece"
  solarreworked.212.d:0 "As she marched to the balcony in her room, Daybreaker caught a few quiet whimpers from Cadance. She kept herself faced away. Inhaling some of the fresh air that gently blew off the balcony, she stared out at [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and sighed. "Cadance, you DO realize that my ponies would move the world for me?  I am their strength and shield. I am Harmony and Order, perfected. If you were to kill me, or overthrow me, whether you established yourself, Luna, or another on the throne, you would never be loved."\n\nCadance choked back a sob. With a sputter, she hissed, "They'd... they'd see that I was doing it for them?"\n\n"And my actions are not in their best interest? If you went down into the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Ponyville, Vanhoover, or others, would you find somepony who believed I wasn't for their best?" Stretching forth a hoof to swipe through the air in order to indicate the capital, Daybreaker looked back at Cadance. Cadance was in a heap, barely able to sit as a few tears dripped onto the marble floor tiles. Streaks of mascara trickled down her cheeks, but she managed to keep from weeping outright.\n\nRotating back, Daybreaker inquired, "I knew that you didn't wish to come here. If you strike me down, perhaps you would take it. But what then? In this world where I am no longer, what would you do? What would you say?" Daybreaker lowered her head slightly. As a sneer formed on her muzzle, she inquired, "What would you say to Flurry?"\n\n"Don't—"\n\n"Oh, but I shall." Daybreaker spun. With heavy hoofbeats toward Cadance, she marched back, and stood tall over her niece. Yet concern laced her words. "Because one day, she will ask why ponies in Equestria whisper behind the monarchy's back, or why resentment is palpable in the streets. Or, if you make everypony love you, why nopony seems natural. Why they will do whatever is asked, no matter how inane. How would you tell her you were the one to create this suffering? Would you tell her it was solely because you believed that I was the monster?"\n\nCadance didn't reply. At first, she merely looked at the floor. Seconds passed and silenced reigned. Then, the floodgates crumbled."
  solarreworked.212.a:0 "Would you want that for her?"
  solarreworked.213.t:0 "Heartbroken"
  solarreworked.213.d:0 "Carefully descending onto her knees, Daybreaker stared at Cadance for a moment as the other alicorn sniffled and whimpered. Clear puddles of tears slowly expanded while Cadance shivered and quaked as she was racked with sobs, yet Daybreaker simply watched. A faint smirk touched the edge of her mouth, and she reached out a hoof to rest on Cadance's shoulder.\n\nWith a small gasp, Cadance's crying momentarily halted, and she looked to Daybreaker; her eyes gleamed, and a few of the faint blood vessels within slowly growing redder with each passing moment. She worked her jaw a couple of times, but could only cough out a couple of letters.\n\n"There's no need to fight," Daybreaker finally stated, placing a bit more pressure on Cadance's shoulder. "You care for your ponies, and my own, as much as I do. You have only been misled. Dogmatic beliefs that have no place in the modern era." Her expression hardened slightly. "Order gives rise to Harmony. Only through it can ponies hope to remain safe, secure, and free." Cadance still remained silent.\n\nTenderly letting out a coo, much like a mother would with a daughter, Daybreaker moved closer, and nuzzled Cadance's head briefly. Some of Cadance's tears stained Daybreaker's fur, but she brushed them quickly off before continuing, "Our ponies need guidance. They still live in fear. There are still enemies ahoof." She gazed directly into Cadance's eyes. "They need assurance and stability. They need somepony who can encourage them to find fellowship in each other, no matter how trying the times. They need a strong role model of the modern Imperial family."\n\nWithdrawing from the quasi-embrace, she rested a hoof on Cadance's chest before declaring, "They need somepony like you."\n\n"I-I can't. They can't if they see me—"\n\n"They will LOVE you, Cadance. And just like how I care for you, you will care for them." A small sneer, sinister and foreboding, crawled upon Daybreaker's muzzle. "And those that do not wish to listen, they will be provided correction.""
  solarreworked.213.a:0 "What say you, Heartbreaker?"
  solarreworked.214.t:0 "The Protege's Protege"
  solarreworked.214.d:0 ""I want to talk to Spike." Daybreaker turned from a couple of nobles to whom she was speaking in the throne room at the declaration. Arching a brow, she watched Sunrise Sparkle march into the room, flanked by a hoofful of soldiers who were meticulously dressed in parade uniform. Nothing but perfection, like their mistress wanted.\n\n"Do you now?" inquired Daybreaker, briefly looking to the nobles and waving them off with a hoof. As both bowed and departed hastily between Sunrise's procession, Daybreaker calmly stalked toward her Lady Inquisitor. "And why is that?" She eyed Sunrise. "Feeling remorse? Guilt? Loneliness?"\n\n"None, my Empress," Sunrise replied, stiffening and staring straight ahead. In her eyes, the brilliant beams of color from the various stained-glass windows in the throne room reflected like a kaleidoscope. Sunrise's gaze grew colder. "He is useful."\n\n"How?"\n\nStartled, Sunrise blinked a couple of times before she stated, "H-He has been a valuable assistant to me before... I was enlightened. He knows how I think. He can point out details I sometimes miss."\n\nDaybreaker hummed. Wrinkling her brow, she got within a few inches of Sunrise's face and stared her down. Nothing she could see hinted at anything behind Sunrise's motives. She stepped back. "You usher him into my Order as well? Would your time not be better spent extracting information from prisoners?" She curled her lip upward. "There are always threats that could topple Harmony."\n\n"Perhaps, Empress, but I believe I will work more efficiently with him. Besides, I believe I will be the only one who can get through to him." For a second, her eyes flashed with excitement, and it was long enough that Daybreaker discerned the change in her mood.\n\nStepping to one of the nearby motes of lava gently meandering through the throne room, Daybreaker beckoned Sunrise. "Sunrise, I feel you are not being entirely truthful."\n\nAt that, Sunrise bit her lip and she exhaled, "I-I suppose I DO want some company."\n\n"Am I not enough? Are not all those who follow me sufficient?"\n\n"Of course! But we are like siblings! I miss him. I want him to know what I know." Sunrise's eyes sparkled excitedly. Breaking decorum, she grabbed one of Daybreaker's forehooves, and declared, "Imagine how great a team we could be if we worked together! I just want to give it a try! I-If he doesn't accept, then—" She sighed. "He can be dealt with as a rebel."\n\nSmiling, Daybreaker nodded. "Very well. You have one chance."\n\nWith a whinny of glee, Sunrise let go and trotted off, and Daybreaker hid a titter."
  solarreworked.214.a:0 "Use it well."
  solarreworked.215.t:0 "The Resilient Assitant"
  solarreworked.215.d:0 "Casting his gaze around nervously, Spike took in the resplendent marble and gleaming gold that lined the castle in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], making the room that he was kept in appear like it was the middle of the day, despite the now-waning sunlight of the evening. Two stallions, dressed in military uniform, and glowing with fire-retardant enchantments, stood on either side of him. Neither met his gaze.\n\nWhat he was doing in the castle was still beyond him. When he was separated from Twilight, he had been left in one of the cells of the castle, and basically ignored since then. Aside from the same meal of a single, low-quality gem, and numerous, almost inedible sandwiches, he had been left alone. Nopony had shown him any interest.\n\nTo say that his mind was racing, knowing that Daybreaker could very well be finally dealing with him, would be an understatement. Yet, between the guards, his chains, and the locked room, there was no easy way out. All he could do was count rubies and hope. Maybe Daybreaker was feeling lenient.\n\nHeart skipping a beat when he heard a latch on the door, he forced back a breath when a young alicorn trotted through the door. Stuttering anxiously as soon as she laid eyes on him, he exclaimed, "Twilight?!"\n\nImmediately, Twilight galloped toward Spike and she pulled him into an embrace, wrapping her wings gently around him. "Spike!" she choked out, as he felt a tear or two trickle down her muzzle onto his scales. "I missed you!" It only took a second or two for him to return the hug, and she coughed some tears. However, they didn't stay like that for long, as Twilight looked up and nodded.\n\n"You're dismissed," she stated solemnly, even if there was still a hint of lingering emotion in her voice.\n\nThe stallions saluted, and one declared, "As you command, Lady Inquisitor."\n\nAs they marched out of the room, Spike's brain replayed what he heard. "'Lady Inquisitor?'" he asked. His eyes started to sting. Details that had been unnoticed in his elation at seeing Twilight began to pop out. Her fur was lighter, her mane now only had a single, blood-red streak in it, and her cutie mark...\n\nIt was blinding.\n\n"Yes, Spike," Twilight replied with a nod. "I serve Equestria now."\n\n"Y-You mean Daybreaker!" he retorted, jabbing a claw at her. At Twilight's confusion, he snapped, "W-What happened to friendship? Magic? Harmony?!"\n\nA sad smile twinging her muzzle, Twilight merely answered, "Oh, Spike, I guess I'll have to give you a few lessons.""
  solarreworked.215.a:0 "You pick up quick, though."
  solarreworked.216.t:0 "The Ignorant Assistant"
  solarreworked.216.d:0 ""What do I need to learn?! That you think Daybreaker's right?!" Spike barked, fruitlessly shoving back at Twilight. While it didn't move her far, she did take a few steps further back. Her eyes glistened with a fresh pain, although whether it was him, or something else, he couldn't say.\n\n"Spike."\n\n"No! This isn't you, Twilight! This is... this is whatever Daybreaker did to you!" Tapping on his head a couple of times with a claw, he added as his spines bristled, "You gotta snap out of it! M-Maybe it's some mind control magic, and you're in there, fighting, and you just need—"\n\n"Spike, this is me." Twilight drew both her wings up and down her front, indicating her entire appearance. With a cautious step toward him, she stated, "I'm still the pony you know." While she did smile, to him, it seemed fake. Perhaps it was the rapid speed she formed it, or the slightly too wide spread, or that her eyes weren't sparkling like they normally did when she was happy, but it rubbed him the wrong way.\n\nHe shivered. "N-No! You'd never help some crazy pony like Daybreaker! You didn't believe any of Chrysalis's lies when she impersonated Cadance! You saw through Cozy Glow's lies!" As warm rivulets of tears dribbled down his cheeks, he clasped both his hands together and implored, "Please, Twilight! You've gotta fight it!"\n\nTwilight's expression hardened. "Oh, Spike..." She shook her head. Drawing herself straighter, she looked back at the door, and powered her magic. It clicked tight, and the deadbolt fastened. "There's nothing to fight." With a small chuckle, she approached him and bent down. He bared his teeth, and she gently tapped him on the nose.\n\n"I'm helping preserve Order. Community! With them, we'll still have friendship and harmony." Her grin grew sinister. "It's just that a few eggs need to be cracked. There's danger in the world. You know that. [GRD.GetNameDef]? [WNG.GetNameDef]? [CHN.GetNameDef]? These and more." Holding up a hoof, she exclaimed, "Oh! Can't forget ponies within Equestria that endanger others."\n\n"By arresting them! What happened to tolerance and understanding? What about friendship?"\n\nSuppressing a giggle, Twilight stood straight and shook her head. "Spike, I have more friends now than I know what to do with! Everypony who helps the Empress is my friend!" She tilted her head. "Don't you want to still be my friend? My number one assistant?"\n\nAt those words, Spike felt as if a knife blade had been twisted into his gut."
  solarreworked.216.a:0 "Don't you like helping me?"
  solarreworked.217.t:0 "The Blind Assistant"
  solarreworked.217.d:0 ""T-This can't be happening!" Spike clutched at his head as he sat back onto the floor. As he did, the chains that bound his legs together clinked and clattered, echoing throughout the room. What little sunlight there was left that came through the window looking out onto [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] made it appears as if the whole floor was on fire. The orange and red glow bounced back up to illuminate Twilight, who stared at Spike expectantly.\n\n"Y-You can't believe this! You overcame Discord! You stopped Tirek! Y-You reformed Starlight and Sunset! Y-Y-You can't just—" Whatever words were left in his throat died as a couple of hiccuping sobs escaped his lips. "J-Just stop it! S-Say this is all a ruse! You're pretending so that Daybreaker will slip up and—"\n\nWith a motherly clicking of her tongue, Twilight sat in front of Spike and rested a forehoof on one of his legs. He paused in his weeping for a second to stare deeply into her eyes. The same purple eyes that he had known for his entire life. Yet, they were foreign. Pain, love, but also anger. Enough to make him cower back as he continued to peer at her.\n\nWhen she saw his reaction, she tsked. Her voice and face darkening, she stated, "Of course, you COULD possibly escape. Maybe if you played a ruse and attacked me, you could render me unconscious. Possibly you could even find a way to take me out of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but what then, Spike? My purpose is higher than just making friends. It's preserving Harmony!" She curled a hoof triumphantly. After a second, she looked back at him. "I could use my number one assistant for that."\n\nShe smiled. Genuinely. "If you fled, you'd be alone, forever. Nopony could help you. They understand how to sacrifice for the greater Harmony." Inching closer to him, her voice grew quieter, more compassionate. "It's so hard to run my experiments without backup." She rolled her eyes. "Sure, the Empress gives me plenty of assistants, but—" She tapped his chest "—they aren't MY assistant."\n\nWhen Spike didn't respond, she let out a small whine and used her magic to pull him toward her. "Spike, I just want my little brother back. It can be like how things used to be." Spike's only answer were the tears staining her fur."
  solarreworked.217.a:0 "Don't you want that?"
  solarreworked.218.t:0 "Metamorophosis"
  solarreworked.218.d:0 "For how long the two creatures, the pony and the drake, sat there, Spike couldn't tell. The months of separation had left his heart feeling raw, and although at first he had found Twilight's words too outlandish to believe, every statement slowly chipped away at his resolve. It was like a changeling was speaking out of a disguise. It was her vocabulary, her voice, her mannerisms. But it wasn't her! Was it?\n\nThrough it all, Twilight had been gently rubbing his spines, moving them back and forth to try and comfort him. Every so often, she hushed him soothingly, the same way that she would back before they first left Canterlot when he was nervous. Still, it wasn't her! At least, it wasn't who she was...\n\n"Spike, won't you help me?" she finally inquired, unlocking her chin from resting on his head. He gazed up at her, and saw a few tears trickling down her own muzzle. As a her mouth twisted into a frown, she muttered, "I just want to make sure you're safe. I want my number one assistant back."\n\nSpike coughed. Wiping at his eyes, he sniffed, "Y-Yeah, right. I-I've seen the castle halls. Ponies love her. It's like they're all mind-controlled." He grunted and furrowed his brow into a glower. "Y-You're no different! Y-You're just as mind controlled as the rest." However, his heart felt like it was being dragged down to Tartarus.\n\n"Spike!" Twilight exclaimed, her wings flaring back instinctively. She placed a hoof on her chest. "I love Daybreaker like everypony else! She's Harmony itself, how could I not? But... I still care about you! I still care about my friends!" Taking one of his claws in her hooves, she asked, "Won't you help me?!" The sinking sensation in his chest only increased, much like a whirlpool sucking debris into the Mareanis Trench.\n\nTwilight sighed. Hanging her head, she powered her horn and in a blink of magic, a stack of comic books appeared next to him. "I got you these. Found them in Manehattan." When he stared at them in shock, she added, "The initial printing of the first ten issues of the Power Ponies. All mint." There was a small note, stating it was "Sunrise's number one assistant."\n\nHis vision hazy, he asked, "Twilight?" She answered with a smile, and then the floodgates burst. Softly hiccuping, Spike leaned forward and into Twilight's embrace. The only thing he could do was nod.\n\nHe didn't see the grin twist into a sneer on Sunrise's muzzle."

  solarreworked.500.d:0 "Even before the Empress ascended to the throne, the old lands of Equestria were the dominant naval power on Equus and the world, rivaled only by [GRD.GetNameDef] and [HIP.GetNameDef]. The old admiralty took pride in the ships that sailed under the flag, and as centuries passed, wood gave way to steel, which was spurred by a desire to maintain modernity with the two Equestrian naval rivals. However, that ultimate navy has aged, and younger nations have striven to take our crown and with new technologies appearing frequently, our old flagship is barely worthy of being used by the Empress.\n\nShe has decreed that a new class of warship, the Daybreak Class, shall be constructed on an advanced technology platform. Multiple proposals have been made, between an untouchable and heavily armed cruiser, an unstoppable battleship, or a carrier that can swarm the skies with fighters. It merely remains to be seen which shall be chosen by the Empress."
