  solarreworked.40.t:0 "An Offer that Can't be Refused"
  solarreworked.40.d:0 "Daybreaker sipped on her tea.\n\n"I can't believe that I'm being subjected to such an indignity!" her guest protested as he squirmed and fumed across the table from her. She merely smiled. As he glowered at her, she sipped again on her tea and then daintily set it aside, next to a large stack of tomes that had been placed on the right side of the table.\n\n"Chancellor Neighsay," she began, her voice dripping with false understanding, "I can completely see your point of view, but—" she shrugged "—I'm afraid that I will have to be insistent."\n\nNeighsay, his cyan eyes burning with fury, quivered and shook with rage. While his cheeks turned a deep shade of purple, he snarled, "I will NOT see the EEA turned into nothing more than a mouthpiece for whatever propaganda you purport to be scientific fact! We have standards! We have codes! We have—"\n\n"Almost no funding left," Daybreaker interjected, as she wrote something down on a napkin near her tea. She stuck out her tongue thoughtfully. "By my quick and dirty math, I'd say... you're at approximately... oh, five percent funding as when you entered." When she stated that, she sneered when he gagged in shock and his eyes went wide.\n\n"That's preposterous! I was assured—"\n\n"You were assured nothing! We met to discuss the new EEA curriculum, and how to properly educate our ponies, but you, sadly, believed that it was 'propaganda' and 'brainwashing'." She clicked her tongue. "It'd be such a shame that you'll be remembered as the last Chairpony of the EEA, and the one that led to its demise." Pursing her lips in an expression of mock compassion. "So sad," she pouted.\n\n"B-But I shall not—"\n\n"And that's four percent remaining."\n\n"Y-You can't—"\n\n"Three percent."\n\n"T-These are nothing but—"\n\n"Two percent."\n\n"Fine! Fine!" Neighsay screamed, throwing himself against the table, which made it rattle and spill tea onto his impeccably clean, red tunic. "I will implement the new curriculum! I can't have my legacy destroyed!"\n\nStaying silent for a moment, Daybreaker grinned. She sipped on her tea."
