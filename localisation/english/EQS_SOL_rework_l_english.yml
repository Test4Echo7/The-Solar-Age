  ###Leader Descriptions###
  fancy_albino_sunhorse_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 16th of March, 986 ALB in Vanhoover\n\nBorn to a simple working class family in one of the boroughs of Vanhoover, Arcane Nova was always aware from an early age of the dangers that were present not a couple hundred miles north of the metropolis. From her parents and teachers, the radio and newspapers, the changeling menace was always something that was in the back of her, and many of her generation's minds. Although there never was a changeling infiltration like some ponies in Vanhoover feared, the backdrop of the threat shaped many of her early interests in military strategy. When Queen Chrysalis almost toppled the Equestrian government in 1002, it only further pushed the teen Arcane Nova to apply for every military academy that would potentially take her.\n\nAn appreciation for war in pre-dawn Equestria was looked upon as strange or frightening, but after acceptance into the class of 1005 to Fillydelphia Military Academy, her talent for analyzing combat situations and adapting to unexpected developments became apparent. When she set a new record for holding out in a scenario designed to be an impossible defense, she was transferred to Canterlot's academy to further refine her aptitude to war and war-related magic.\n\nIn the ensuing restructuring of the military after Daybreaker's ascension, her unwavering dedication to guarding Equestria and her astute observations earned her a position within the military science wing of the Solar Empire. When she was summoned by Daybreaker to personally oversee and ensure the loyalty of New Mareland, she was more than eager to prove her abilities to her Empress.\n\nIn New Mareland, she has guaranteed that there is nothing that can be used to question the Empress's decrees. Unrest has been met with disproportionate punishment, and any and all mention to Luna, thestrals, or other creatures of the night have been suppressed. In time, the troublesome colony will become a model subject of the Empress, where the Dawn Star is revered at all times, and all dissidence is eliminated with cauterizing efficiency.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

  solarreworked.40.d:0 "Daybreaker sipped on her tea.\n\n"I can't believe that I'm being subjected to such an indignity!" her guest protested as he squirmed and fumed across the table from her. She merely smiled. As he glowered at her, she sipped again on her tea and then daintily set it aside, next to a large stack of tomes that had been placed on the right side of the table.\n\n"Chancellor Neighsay," she began, her voice dripping with false understanding, "I can completely see your point of view, but—" she shrugged "—I'm afraid that I will have to be insistent."\n\nNeighsay, his cyan eyes burning with fury, quivered and shook with rage. While his cheeks turned a deep shade of purple, he snarled, "I will NOT see the EEA turned into nothing more than a mouthpiece for whatever propaganda you purport to be scientific fact! We have standards! We have codes! We have—"\n\n"Almost no funding left," Daybreaker interjected, as she wrote something down on a napkin near her tea. She stuck out her tongue thoughtfully. "By my quick and dirty math, I'd say... you're at approximately... oh, five percent funding as when you entered." When she stated that, she sneered when he gagged in shock and his eyes went wide.\n\n"That's preposterous! I was assured—"\n\n"You were assured nothing! We met to discuss the new EEA curriculum, and how to properly educate our ponies, but you, sadly, believed that it was 'propaganda' and 'brainwashing'." She clicked her tongue. "It'd be such a shame that you'll be remembered as the last Chairpony of the EEA, and the one that led to its demise." Pursing her lips in an expression of mock compassion. "So sad," she pouted.\n\n"B-But I shall not—"\n\n"And that's four percent remaining."\n\n"Y-You can't—"\n\n"Three percent."\n\n"T-These are nothing but—"\n\n"Two percent."\n\n"Fine! Fine!" Neighsay screamed, throwing himself against the table, which made it rattle and spill tea onto his impeccably clean, red tunic. "I will implement the new curriculum! I can't have my legacy destroyed!"\n\nStaying silent for a moment, Daybreaker grinned. She sipped on her tea."

  ###Flavour Events###
  solarreworked.50.t:0 "A Sister's Love"
  solarreworked.50.d:0 ""Celestia! I came as fast as I could!" Luna exclaimed as she burst through the door of Celestia's makeshift office, which her sister had commandeered once the war began. As soon as she entered, her breath caught in her throat when she caught the various stacks of papers, reports, and charts that were scattered around the floor. A pair towered almost as high as the ceiling, which made her crane her neck upward to try and see the top of them.\n\n"Celestia?" she inquired. Somewhere buried in the piles of paper, her sister sneezed and a small cloud of paper flew toward the door from the desk in the middle of the room.\n\nWhen Celestia didn't bid her come, Luna rolled her eyes and trotted toward the desk and floated off the pages, which all appeared to be costs and recent casualty reports. "Sister, you must—" Her train of thought halted when she she saw Celestia. The alicorn's eyes were bloodshot, and her fur was tracked with mascara. Even her normally regal mane was completely frazzled and fraying. About a dozen cups of coffee were scattered across the desktop, along with some stains from spilled refills.\n\nLuna smirked.\n\nFinally peering up at her sister, Celestia whimpered, "Don't look at me."\n\n"Then, pray tell, why did you summon me?" calmly prodded Luna as she made her way around the desk.\n\n"I don't know!" Celestia retorted. Crossing her forelegs together, she shifted to avoid looking at Luna. She flinched when Luna rested a forehoof on her shoulder. Neither said anything, and Luna could feel the tension escalating in the room.\n\n"Is something wrong?" Luna gently nudged at last. Celestia shot a glance back at Luna as tears trickled down her cheeks. Luna hissed, while Celestia simply went back to gazing at her hooves.\n\nSwallowing deeply, Luna prodded, "'Tia... you have taken on so much. Mayhap you should—"\n\n"No!" bellowed Celestia, which made Luna's ears flatten in surprise. Celestia blushed. "I-I mean, I can't. They're my ponies, and I have to protect them, and I can't do that if—" Before she could finish, Luna leaned in and pulled Celestia out of the chair and onto the floor.\n\nLuna simply clicked her tongue as she wrapped her wings around Celestia. "You love them, 'Tia, which is why you fret." As tears started streaking down her own muzzle, Luna pulled up Celestia's chin with a wingtip, and she choked out, "But you can't do it on your own. Let me help. Please."\n\nAs she returned to an embrace, she heard Celestia sniffle, "Okay.""
  solarreworked.50.a:0 "Good talk."
  solarreworked.51.t:0 "A Sister's Fear"
  solarreworked.51.d:0 ""I—I just don't know, Lulu," Celestia sighed tiredly. Outside, she could hear the steady beat of hooves as ponies marched through the command post. It was not far from the front lines, but that was how Luna preferred it. If she wasn't leading her troops directly, she wasn't truly a leader. Celestia simply massaged one of her temples. Black circles ringed her eyes, and her body ached.\n\n"That... is certainly an ordeal, 'Tia," Luna breathed, her eyes tracking Celestia as the princess anxiously got to her hooves and began to pace in the tent. "When was the last time you properly slumbered?"\n\n"I slept last night."\n\n"Was it for more than an hour? I was able to attend to my dream duties last night, and I did not sense your presence in the dream realm." Luna arched a brow inquisitively as Celestia fidgeted. "Perhaps you have spent too much time—"\n\nAbruptly interrupting Luna's statement, a blaring alarm siren pierced the air, which whipped the alicorns' heads outward. Almost immediately afterward, a series of gunshots resounded and Luna sprang up from her desk. Various pictures of her with soldiers or half-finished dream catchers were knocked loose by her sudden movement. "An assault?!" she demanded aloud. "Who would be foalish enough to—"\n\nHer answer was a bullet that whizzed through the tarp, which narrowly avoided grazing Celestia's cheek. The two of them stared at each other for a beat, then Luna's horn ignited in a blue flare, before she charged out of the tent.\n\nPanting heavily, Celestia galloped out after Luna with wobbly legs. She whined when she saw a number of ponies fighting each other, although some of the ones that lost reverted in bright green flashes to their changeling form.\n\nIn the chaos of gunshots and screams, she lost track of Luna. When there was a loud explosion of magic, she quickly darted to Luna's location. She arrived to see Luna standing over three corpses, breathing heavily. However, she was oblivious to a fourth pony who was creeping up on her, knife between his teeth.\n\n"Luna!" she shrieked, just as the disguised changeling pounced. As he landed on Luna, about ready to stab, Celestia roared in fury, and a sudden ball of fire wrapped around the changeling. He batted at himself for a second before scrambling off Luna, and collapsing in a stinking pile of burnt chitin.\n\nWhen her vision cleared, she saw her work, and collapsed, her stomach giving out. She joined the changeling on the ground, the taste of bile in her mouth."
  solarreworked.51.a:0 "What have I done?!"
  solarreworked.52.t:0 "Command Confusion"
  solarreworked.52.d:0 "Barely containing the fire that was raging in her chest, Princess Luna marched through the hallways of Canterlot Castle. Her peripheral vision was tinged red, and she softly ground her teeth against each other. Every guard that was stationed along her path toward Celestia's chambers dove out of her way. None had to be mind-readers to see the veritable cloud of emotion that was visible on her face.\n\nWhen she arrived at her sister's door, she inhaled deeply and mimicked the technique that Cadance had showed her. Apparently it greatly assisted Twilight whenever she was in a tizzy. After repeating it a few times, she came to one conclusion: it was bunk. If anything, she wanted to plant the hoof she had used through Celestia's wall, and then—\n\nShe cut herself off before it turned into an internal rant. Instead, she rapped heavily on Celestia's door before she barged in. Celestia, her mane rather frizzy and unkempt, jerked up her head at Luna's entrance. She gawked silently.\n\nIn an overly sweet and caring voice, Luna smiled in a saccharine manner and inquired, "Sister, please, perchance, if you could inform Us what possible reason that THOU WOULDST AGREE TO THIS INSANITY?!" Her outburst managed to crack some of the marble around the door's entrance and under her hooves. Furiously, she held out a series of papers, authorizing, with Celestia's seal, a thinly-veiled all out assault on [BUF.GetNameDef].\n\nCelestia simply stared at it for a second, then hastily poured herself a goblet of wine and guzzled it down. She didn't reply. Rather, she started to pour over reports on her desk.\n\n"Dost thou need another reprimand?!" Luna demanded, stomping over to Celestia's desk and slamming the papers approving the "special military operation". "Verily, We didst not conceive that thou wouldst agree to thy warmonger advisors' counsel." Shooting Celestia a glare, she demanded, "Pray tell, what hast thou for thy defense?!"\n\n"Dialect, Lulu," Celestia finally grunted, although she avoided looking at her sister.\n\n"Nay, We shall speak to thee as We wish! What hast possessed thee?! Our sister would never—"\n\n"I don't know!" Celestia barked, making Luna flinch and back. "I-I just felt like... somepony else was controlling me. I—" She gulped back tears. "I don't know..."\n\nSighing, Luna brushed back her mane and stated, "We—I suppose there is one solution. It may save us some embarrassment."

  solarreworked.70.d:0 "When the battlecruiser HMS Golden Dawn and its entourage of screening ships arrived in the harbor of Sunset, the mood was instantly soured, although it was not because of a lack of fanfare. In a matter of fifteen minutes, Jet Set was alerted to the arrival of somepony from [EQS.GetNameDef] and hurried to the pier. His heartreat skyrocketed when he saw a few of his soldiers already there in parade formation.\n\nFor the last couple of minutes, he stood patiently, feeling the sea breeze blowing through his mane and spraying droplets of saltwater onto his glasses. However, he didn't touch them. Not when the unannounced visitor could emerge any moment. He swallowed nervously.\n\nJust as he was about to give into the irritation, there was clanking of gangplanks, and soon one was lowered from the side of the battlecruiser. He stiffened at the sight of a uniformed mare, flanked on either side by guards. For a brief second, she surveyed the pier, then stalked down the gangplank. She disembarked and marched directly in his direction.\n\n"Governor General Jet Set, how kind of you to finally greet me," she spat as she reached him. In an instant, her piercing blue eyes had completely sized him up. Somehow, he could sense that she saw right through him. If there was one thing he noticed about her, was that she was YOUNG. Why would [EQS.GetLeader] send somepony who was so green?\n\nAfter gathering his voice, he merely responded with, "[EQS.Leader] didn't inform me that I should be expecting an—" He coughed "—an honored guest." At that, she lightly tittered.\n\n"How quaint," she retorted with a snort. Momentarily a snarky twinkle appeared in her eyes, and she brushed back her braided mane behind her topcoat. "Why would she announce that you should expect her official representative? You could easily hide damning details."\n\nJet's breath hitched. "I assure you, there is nothing that—"\n\nWaving a hoof dismissively, she strode past him. "Save your platitudes! I'm not an idiot. We shall see if there is a reason to trust your word." She paused. Turning back, she added, "But do be sure that it's a challenge. Certainly more than that pin of the old regime." She nodded at a symbol of the two sisters on his chest. "It's far from subtle regarding where your loyalties lie.""

  solarreworked.100.d:0 ""I-It's an, um, pleasure, to host you, Y-Your Majesty," Posey Shy meekly stated as she brought out a pot of tea from the kitchen of she and her husband's humble abode. Cracking an awkward smile, she placed the pot on the small table in their living room. When Daybreaker arched a brow, Posey adjusted her glasses and tittered uneasily. She poured a cup and passed it to Daybreaker, who merely gazed at it for a second before sipping on it.\n\n"Not to be rude, Your Grace, b-but why did you say you came again?" Posey's husband, Gentle Breeze, inquired with a quivering voice. He nervously switched his attention between the two guards that were standing at rapt attention at the entrance to the living room.\n\nAfter taking another drink of her tea, Daybreaker merely looked at him for a moment, then quipped, "Does your Empress require a reason to impose upon her subjects?"\n\n"No! Not at all! I'm merely confused why it would be US?" Gentle glanced between him and his wife. Although it was faint, there was a spark of worry in his eyes, beyond just being in the presence of his better.\n\nBefore Daybreaker could respond, the front door of the Shy's slammed and a carefree, young voice exclaimed, "Yo, Mom! Pops! I'm back from an aching long day. Won't ya come out here and help grab my stuff?" Seconds later, an aquamarine pegasus trotted into the room and gasped. "You're hosting a '"Welcome back, Zephyr" party?!' You shouldn't have!" He shot one glance at Daybreaker. "Heya, Hot Stuff."\n\nBraying indignantly, Daybreaker nodded her head and both guards darted to seize Zephyr. He let out a whinny of surprise, but stated, "You know, if you really like me that much—"\n\n"Silence, foal!" Daybreaker hissed. Bending down to stare him in the eyes, she growled, "As one of the Element Bearers' siblings, ponies look to you, whether you realize it or not."\n\nDaybreaker unfurled a letter. "Normally, draft dodging is below me, but in this case, I'll make an exception."\n\n"N-Now, I'm sure there's an explanation for—" Posey began before Daybreaker glared directly into her soul. She squeaked and went mute.\n\nSquinting, Zephyr inspected the letter while making a low hum. He shrugged, "Sorry, Hot Stuff. Not interested. All that blood and guts would ruin my resplendent mane job."\n\nWith a low growl, Daybreaker bared her teeth and yanked him forward by the muzzle with her magic. Her eyes narrowed. "I wasn't asking, foal!""

  solarreworked.101.d:0 ""Can't believe the nerve of her," Zephyr Breeze grumbled softly as he settled into a nook between a couple of trees. Twelve weeks of basic, just to be thrown a gun and then left out to rot on some smelly battlefield. Did they know how many grains of dirt he'd found underneath his hooves?! More than one! Couldn't even take a Celestia-foresaken nap around his sergeant without getting screamed at.\n\nThankfully no blood had gotten on him yet, but if he had to fight a bug or something with his bayonet, then all that ichor would stain him for months.\n\nSuddenly, a bullet whizzed by his head and broke his reverie. A second later, a couple of screams carried toward him, and he yawned as he tried to drown things out. Apparently there was some battle going on right now, but who cared? He needed to catch up on some zs, and his CO wasn't paying attention right now.\n\nHowever, between the noise of combat and the deep-seated anger he felt from that admittedly looker of an alicorn who hauled him off to boot camp, he could barely get any rest. Cracking an eye open, he grunted when it grew quiet, and he huffed before getting up and checking on the command post, which was nearby. Perhaps one of the nerds there could tell him of a nice hiding spot to snooze away the day.\n\nAfter weaving through a few corridors, which had klaxon sirens blaring, he spotted the quarters of the regiment's general, Cuff Link, and poked his head in. "Heya, General?" he asked, an idea coming to his mind. Nopony was there.\n\nGrinning from ear to ear, he slunk in and poked around in the wardrobe. Sure enough, there was a spare uniform, like he hoped there would be. After quickly donning, he turned around, and screamed when a soldier rushed into the room. However, the soldier saluted, and exclaimed, "General! You were reported killed in battle. What are you doing here?!"\n\nZephyr's mind raced. Sweat trickled down his neck. Stuttering, he fibbed, "W-Well, that's obviously because somepony who LOOKED like me was killed. I was here the entire time. Definitely." He cracked an uneasy smile.\n\nPanic etched into his face, the soldier grabbed him without questioning the lie. "Part of the line has been broken! We need you to direct its regrouping!" Before Zephyr could protest, he was grabbed by a hoof, and pulled toward the communications room. Zephyr could only sigh."

  solarreworked.102.d:0 "Kicking back in his office chair and sighing, Zephyr Breeze slipped his both his forelegs behind his head pressed as far as he could into the plush leather. In only a few weeks, he had completely transformed that stuffy, old room that the geezer before him had used into a hip and fun place. A few pictures—of himself, of course—an icebox with a selection of various ciders, and a pool table. Could still use a few more amenities, but it was a start.\n\nOutside his office, he could hear ponies rushing to and fro, and one mare quickly poked her head in to inquire, "Have you finished, General?"\n\n"Hm?" Zephyr cracked an eyelid open. "Oh, yeah, yeah!" Swiping a single page from his desk, which he spent all of maybe two seconds reading, he tossed it toward her. From the title, he thought it might have been something about fireworks, or the like.Something with some big booms. Maybe they were all using those giant guns a couple miles away for a show later.\n\n"What about the inventory reports on our current medical supplies?" the aide asked as she took the page in her magic.\n\n"Oh, uh, I gave that to Corporal, uh, Smudge or something," Zephyr mumbled as he started to slip back into sleep. Yawning, he muttered, "You know, delegation is key to success!" He spread his wings to stretch them, then waved her off. "You can go now. I'm just going to, uh, think on some new battle plans. Yeah!"\n\nDutifully, the mare left and his door clicked shut. For a few minutes, the hustle and bustle continued outside, but it soon grew disturbingly quiet as a few sets of hooves stomped toward his office. As the door slammed open, he sighed, "Yo, what'd I tell you about—"\n\nAs his vision cleared, he froze when he saw a unicorn with the exact same fur and mane color as him glowering at him, while standing between two guards, who were also looking outraged. The double, who was probably about fifteen years older, was missing part of an ear, and had a large gauze patch over half his face and neck. He wore a general's uniform.\n\nZephyr gulped. "Ah, General Link! I-I heard that you were KIA. But, uh, I see I was wrong." As the general's glower deepened, Zephyr spied the window in the office, and tensed. "I'd love to chat, but, uh, I kept your seat warm, and uh, I think I'll be going!" Leaping for the window, he punched through the glass, and was soon nothing more than a distant speck on the horizon."

  solarreworked.103.d:0 "It wasn't often that Refraction saw life along the border between [CRY.GetNameDef] and [EQS.GetNameDef]. With her station set along one of the few small settlements of [CRY.GetNameDef], she had a relatively quiet position. In the past, there had been an odd incident or two of an accused changeling infiltrator, before it was determined that it was just a unicorn with a mild allergy to magic. There was even a bugbear once, but it was being directed by Fluttershy to a safe nesting location, so it wasn't much of a threat.\n\nTherefore, when she caught some movement in the sky on her way back to her station for the evening, she frowned. Readying her rifle, she took aim and traced it as it grew larger. Soon enough, she could see it was a lanky pegasus. Since she was concealed by some of the shrubs in the wooded area near the town, she could watch him as he approached.\n\nHe seemed to be fleeing. Every so often, he'd glance over his shoulders like he was being pursued, but he wasn't being followed, from what she could see. When he was about three hundred feet out and above her, she stepped and called, "Halt! You're entering [CRY.GetAdjective] territory!" He screamed with a haggard gasp and noticed her. She held her gun at the ready.\n\nFreezing and looking at her gun, he obeyed and descended. When his hooves touched the earth, he collapsed and began to kiss it. "Thank Celestia!" he exclaimed when he stopped. "Finally somepony to help me!" Before Refraction could ask him anything, he grabbed both her shoulders and shook her. "They're after me! I-I barely made it out! I know they're hunting little ol' me!"\n\nShe pushed him back. Arching a brow, she demanded, "Who's hunting you?" Now that she was closer, she could tell he was wearing a rather sweat-drenched uniform of an [EQS.GetAdjective] officer. "Wait," she began. "Are you an [EQS.GetAdjective] soldier?" She tightened her grip on her rifle.\n\nFor a second, he blinked at her, and then he bobbed his head up and down frantically. "Y-Yeah, totally! Five star gen-er-RAL!" He fluttered his lashes at her innocently. "They were cramping my style, so I said, 'No thanks, buckos!' and then they just started chasing me!" He hopped up. "Super important pony, after all." He shot her a smug grin. "Probably sent a whole army after me."\n\n"Right..." she muttered. "Well, it'll have to be verified, but if you're an [EQS.GetAdjective] general..." Pausing for a second, she finally quipped, "I think we have a job for you.""

Reaching vainly to her coffee cup, she groaned and hung her head before she put down the clipboard, then leaned over to grab it. She swiped at air, which made her look back up to blink in surprise. Then she heard a loud, long slurp as the other pony—correction, one of the other ponies—guzzled HER coffee. She snarled.\n\nWhen his eyes locked with hers, he stopped mid-slurp and just looked at her. He wiggled his eyebrows playfully.\n\n"Private, is there a reason you're still in here with your—" Petal eyed him again "—your general?"\n\n"Don't worry about her, Glitter Glow—"\n\n"That isn't even close to my name."\n\n"Whatever." The stallion waved a hoof dismissively. To her consternation and rapidly skyrocketing migraine, he leaned back on his chair and kicked his hind hooves up on the table. The interrogation table. Not that he really seemed to treat the offices of [CRY.GetAgency]'s with much respect. Or really the offices of anything in [CRY.GetNameDef] that well, from what she saw on her clipboard.\n\nIf it weren't because he was, from what they could verify, a general in [EQS.GetNameDef]'s military, he would have probably been looking at a dishonorable discharge, at best.\n\nWith a long, exasperated sigh, she rubbed her temples for a second or two, then looked at her clipboard. She had to double check his name. Zephyr Sneeze. Straightening her papers, she asked him, "General, if we may begin?"\n\n"Hmm?" he inquired, as he was looking at one of the rank stripes on his [CRY.GetAdjective] uniform. "Oh, sure, shiny stuff. But you didn't need to take me here to—"\n\n"Stuff it," she huffed, then flipped through a couple more pages. "All right, so, now that we finally have the bandwidth, what can you tell us about some of [EQS.GetLeader]'s battle plans? Troop compositions? Research projects?" With each question, Zephyr's posture grew more discomforted and he started to wriggle uneasily. "Anything? You said you were a 'top-top-brass.'" She furrowed her brow. "So?"\n\n"Uh, well, you know, when I said that I meant, actually, uh—" Zephyr pulled on his collar, then spotted one of small windows in the room.

  solarreworked.105.d:0 ""And you picked him up where?" Commissar Kirov inquired one of his underlings as he stalked through the corridors of the small outpost between [STG.GetNameDef] and [CRY.GetNameDef]. As they passed a small portrait of Steel Stallion, they both saluted before continuing on.\n\nThe private was uncomfortably waffling between a few different ways to start. Between all the uhs, ahs, ums, and wells, he did get out that they picked up the [CRY.GetAdjective] officer up right on the border. Apparently, he was staggering around, and claimed he hadn't had a drink of water in seven weeks, which was simply absurd. Also, when he had seen it was a [STG.GetAdjective] patrol, he then started saying all he needed was vodka. And also began speaking in a thick, stereotypical, [STG.GetAdjective] accent.\n\n"Right," Kirov grunted as he dismissed the peon. By now, they had gotten to the outpost's one interrogation room, and he began to observe the prisoner from behind the one-way mirror. Certainly, he appeared to be a [CRY.GetAdjective] officer, given the rather ragged uniform which he was wearing. Still, he was an Equestrian, given the complete lack of crystal shine. Those were rare.\n\nScratching his chin, Kirov huffed and brushed back some of his dark blue mane before entering. As soon as the officer heard him enter, the stallion ran to him and begged, "Please! I need some hoof trimmers. Poor ol' me hasn't have a good hooficure in AGES!" He coughed. Suddenly in a thick, movie-like accent, he also inquired, "Uh, and comrade, get me an entire bottle of wodka. Da?"\n\nKirov glowered at him.\n\nCoughing into a hoof, the stallion tittered, "W-Well, ah, I thought that'd go better in my head."\n\nIn perfect Equestrian, with little inflection, Kirov grunted, "I speak your language fine, capitalist lackey. Do not insult my intelligence."\n\n"O-Oh, buddy, I'm not ANYPONY'S lackey," he stated while wrapping a hoof around Kirov's neck. "You know, I always said, 'Zephyr uh... Cheese, don't let nopony cramp yer style,' and I am one free soul!" He smiled widely at Kirov and added, "Totally thought outside the box and just—" He whistled and whipped his hoof up high. "Shot straight to the top."\n\n"Right..."\n\n"And can I like, stay here for a while?" With an innocent grin, he rapidly fluttered his eyelids. "Please?! I may be chased by uh, you know, them."\n\n"Oh, so a traitor, hmm?" Kirov muttered as he rubbed his chin thoughtfully. Clearing his throat, he snapped and pushed Zephyr off him. "I will speak to my superiors. They have use for you after all." He sneered. "I'd suggest you accept it. It beats being shot."\n\nZephyr gulped."

It was a sweet irony, to see [GRD.GetNameDef] rise by the point of a sword, only for it to come crumbling down from years of decay, undermining, and politics. Even its resurgence, which she had to admit, wasn't entirely expected, was clearly a last gasp by a dying creature.\n\nAs if to emphasize her thoughts, she saw a grand, sprawling mural of Grover II, depicting his various campaigns across the continent. Conveniently, it ignored the fact that it was a pony who ended the fool. She merely held back a chuckle at it. If Grover II was alive, he would have been appalled at the resplendent lives of his descendants. True, he led life as a noble, but he had been a warrior at heart.\n\nWith her entertainment quota fulfilled, she marched toward her objective: the doors to the young Grover's chambers. She nodded to her two guards that were stationed on either side of them, and she entered. Already, her magic was readied for a surprise attack, but none came. Instead, Grover merely sat by his window. When she entered, he closed his book he was reading and readjusted his glasses.\n\n"What do you want?" he demanded rather testily in a faint Griffenheim accent. A few molting feathers fell off his adolescent face. "You have already bested us. Do you wish to kill me?" He straightened and puffed out his chest, but she could see him quiver faintly in fear. "You won't find me groveling for mercy."\n\nBearing her fangs and chortling, Daybreaker shook her head and clucked, "No, no, my little... griffon. You misunderstand my intentions."\n\n"Really? I have read the reports on what has happened in Equestria," Grover responded with a huff. Daybreaker suppressed a snarl at the mention of her nation's old name.\n\n"What's happened in MY EMPIRE is none of your concern." Trotting closer to him and letting her mane flap about and bathe his chambers in an orange glow, she stated, "But you shall learn in time that my decisions were only for my ponies' protection." As he flared his wings defensively, she sneered and added, "You shall learn much from me."\n\n"Where is [GetGriffonRegent]?!" he demanded. "If [GRD.GetLeader.GetSheHe] has been harmed, I'll—"\n\n"[GRI.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] is... indisposed, little griff," Daybreaker chortled.

Amidst the cobbled streets and winding alleyways of the homeland of the griffons, a varied procession of ponies and griffons marched toward the ceremonial coronation hall, formerly the kingly palace of Grover I, and later, of his blood relatives, the Gutos, which reached up to the heavens above the other, destitute buildings of the old metropolis, cutting like a gleaming knife through hot butter.\n\nAlthough the procession itself was a rather proud affair, none of the griffons that had been assembled to spectate made noise. Interspersed throughout, easily noticeable by the wake they created, armed pony soldiers, dressed in brilliant white parade uniform, watched for signs of dissent.\n\nIn the middle of the procession, Daybreaker slowly, haughtily, cantered. For once, instead of wearing her armor, she was adorned in a shimmering golden gown, which trailed behind her and was kept clean through various enchantments. Casting her gaze around her observers, she only sneered in amused contempt at their searing glares. Whatever they thought mattered not, for soon they would be able to question her even less than they already could.\n\nIn only a couple of minutes, the parade had finally reached the entrance to the coronation hall, the pillars of which glistened in the noonday sun. Briefly, Daybreaker remained stationary at the steps of the hall, looking back at the statue of Grover I that they had passed. Its chipped and eroded made her chuckle. Such a fitting picture of an aging empire.\n\nInside the hall, the domed roof permitted the full display of the Sun's beauty to come through. Ahead of the ceremony, perfectly clear crystal chalices, chandeliers, and every other item that could be conceived were set up for the noble guests. She barely registered it, though, as she suppressed a cackle when she saw Grover VI and his regent, [GRD.GetLeader], along with one of the Griffonstone nobles, waiting for her on the dais.\n\nSauntering her way toward the dais after waiting for the choir of griffons to be convinced to pronounce her entrance, she nodded once to the noble, and merely shot Grover a self-assured smirk. Surprisingly, the young griff remained restrained, and kept his face from displaying any emotion. However, she could see in his eyes that he was fighting between furious, combative, and resigned.\n\nIt didn't take long for her goal to be retrieved. The glimmering crown of the Grovers soon was escorted toward the dais, and she bore her teeth in delight. With a single sigh, she took it, placed it upon her head, and waited.\n\nThe only applause she received was dead silence."

Grover didn't bother replying, though, as he continued to just listlessly fiddle with one of the pieces of food on his plate.\n\n"And if I refuse?" he muttered in response, giving Daybreaker a side-eye and munching on one of the pieces of liver that was displayed on the plate. "You'll finally kill me, like I thought all along?"\n\nDaybreaker rolled her eyes. Finishing her salad, she huffed, "Preposterous! I would have no reason!"\n\n"Other than being a bloodthirsty murderer?" retorted Grover, which earned a raised eyebrow from her. "Do not intend to lie to me about what goes on in Equestria. Your toadies that you leave in your place while you're away blab even when I'm around." He snorted. "They must believe I'm still a chick."\n\n"Bold of you to tell me you spy on conversations that don't concern you," Daybreaker snarled, her mane momentarily flaring a slightly hotter yellow. However, Grover didn't flinch, and the additional light and heat from her soon dissipated. Pushing aside a couple of scrolls which she had been reading in between spurts of conversation, she stated, "But I'm feeling benevolent today."\n\n"How exciting." Grover returned to reading his book, his plate mostly uneaten.\n\nGritting her teeth, Daybreaker grunted, "If you are so curious regarding the state of my empire, then you will begin your education now."\n\n"You do realize that I've been receiving tutelage for over a decade now, no? My education—"\n\n"Is not sufficient," she cut in as she waltzed toward him. In her magic, she brought both her scrollsdropped them into his lap. "Read them. Give me your ruling," she ordered, her tone harsh and commanding.\n\nMomentarily, he stared at her, the faintest hint of fear revealing itself in his raised hackles. He scanned the scrolls. From what he could tell, they were two reports of captured prisoners, one from [EQS.GetNameDef], one from [GRD.GetNameDef].\n\n"The value stolen isn't much. I would... probably give them a small sentence and then release them," he stated. As there was a burst of flame from the liver on his plate, he jumped in shock.\n\n"Incorrect. They will both steal again. The pony has been captured on thirteen charges, the griffon has been in your jails three times."

Stationed at the entrance to the throne room, as well as on either side of the dais up to the throne, [EQS.GetAdjective] soldiers stood rigidly at attention, potentially more than usual, given that they were within the presence of their Empress.\n\nIn Grover's mind, he couldn't imagine the last time they were this on edge. Even other times that Daybreaker had visited for her duties as regent, she didn't instill as much fear as he saw in them now. As he adjusted his glasses, he studied one of the soldiers closely, noting many of the hidden emotions that were forcing their way out. Subtle cues: tightened jaw, slight working of the teeth, a small fidget in the left hind leg. All indicated that, not only was this pony fearful, he was furious. Most likely upset at being stationed here, not that he'd admit it near his Empress.\n\nAs his mind wandered, he was broken from his observation as Daybreaker cast a small field of magic on some of his hackles, and he growled testily. She straightened them out and grunted, "Silence. I do not wish to be here any more than you do, griff."\n\n"And you did not need to attend, pony," he grumbled in return as she fixed a slight crease in his uniform. When she finished, he huffed and brushed off the topcoat which he wore, which clinked with a few medals that he'd yet to actually earn. Meanwhile, she was gowned in a fire orange dress, and eschewed her normal regalia. In front of them both, a trembling griffon who was hurriedly setting up various mirrors near a camera to reflect the light darted glanced at them occasionally.\n\nDaybreaker scoffed at his statement. "I am your regent. I believe I deserve to be acknowledged."\n\n"I am old enough to—"\n\n"Enough babbling," she interrupted with a hiss, which only earned a glare from him. "This matter is settled. The Empire must see its rulers."\n\n"Or its ruler and her puppet," he quipped back as the photographer motioned for them to stand back. When they were lined up with the throne to create a background with it between them, the griffon made them stop, and Grover furrowed his brow.\n\n"Smile, griff," Daybreaker hissed, just as they were both blinded by the flash of the camera.\n\nHe didn't comply."

If they are so confident that they can endure the heat of the Sun, then they shall face its full radiance!\n\nLet them feel the might of the Dawn Star! Let them cower as their comrades perish in flame! Let them crawl and beg, plead for mercy, and receive none! As the fire crawls upon their skin and consumes their sin, they shall feel my justice!\n\nFor I am the Sun! I am the Light of Equus! I am Order Incarnate!\n\nI. AM. HARMONY!\n\nAnd they will all §RBURN!§!"
