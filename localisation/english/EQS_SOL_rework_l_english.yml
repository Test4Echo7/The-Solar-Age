  ###BoP###
  EQS_sanity_bop:0 "The Princess's Burden"
  EQS_sanity_bop_desc:0 "In the changing world, an alicorn must adapt to the necessities of the modern ethos. Princess Celestia has led the nation of Equestria for a thousand years, and in that time she has seen kingdoms rise and fall, villains conquer and be conquered, and technology approach the levels of magic. In these dark times of turbulent war, it falls to her and her alone to shoulder this responsibility and make the difficult decisions for the good of Equestria. However, not even an immortal alicorn is safe from the burdens of war..."

  EQS_discuss_fears_with_luna_desc:0 "War has not touched the land of Equestria for hundreds of years and the wakeup call to ponies across the land has been harsh. Despite her experience, Celestia always had a taste for diplomacy over conflict, and left Luna to handle military matters when the diarchy was intact. As she has taken an active interest in her ponies' fate, it has drained her mentally. But that's why sisters are there for support."

  EQS_taste_of_the_war:0 "Get a Taste of the War"
  EQS_taste_of_the_war_desc:0 "Celestia was always the diplomat and frequently emerged victorious in negotiation rooms before war could break out rather than on the battlefield. War is a novel experience. While she was sole monarch, only two instances of fighting had broken out of note: the final viking raids and the communist uprising in Severyana; the former being pacified through diplomacy, the latter ending with disgrace and retreat. Although it's against her nature, the Princess has wished to see what it truly is like on the front lines while in active conflict, and catching up with her sister is a perfect excuse."

  EQS_clear_fancys_clique:0 "Clear out Fancy's Clique"
  EQS_clear_fancys_clique_desc:0 "Although Fancy Pants has already been dealt with, since the Empress has properly prosecuted him for his stance against her, there are still some of his fellow nobles who hold great influence and have grown to be in opposition to her. Dissent within the ranks is unacceptable, and it's time that these thorns disappear."
  EQS_close_public_spaces:0 "Close Public Spaces"
  EQS_close_public_spaces_desc:0 "Our control is too tenuous to allow for unfiltered meetings and gatherings in the public square or market. To maintain order in the populace, we must ward these off and institute patrols to arrest anypony who would assemble there, as they clearly are up anti-Harmony activities and seek to dethrone the Empress."
  EQS_implement_loyalty_tests:0 "Implement Loyalty Tests"
  EQS_implement_loyalty_tests_desc:0 "Harmony is in danger and there are those within our military that seek to undermine it, solely through "ethtical" standards. While there are many open dissenters, there are sure to be numerous more that are too fearful to voice their resistance, but will still actively work against the Empress's wishes. Loyalty tests by commanding officers appointed by the Empress will root out many self-appointed harmonists."
  EQS_ban_harmonic_phrases:0 "Ban Rebellious Phrases"
  EQS_ban_harmonic_phrases_desc:0 "The resistance against the Empress is too easy to organize, as they can simply use dog whistles in their speech to communicate with other, likeminded ponies. Arresting any who speak of, for instance, the night, or of the sudden change in Harmony's directives will either frighten those who are thinking of disobeying or only point out who is against Harmony."
  EQS_shut_down_newspapers:0 "Shut Down Newspapers"
  EQS_shut_down_newspapers_desc:0 "The "free press" has done nothing but slander the Empress and Harmony and print defeatist, anti-Harmony propaganda since our war for survival began. Despite the Empress already clamping down on them, they find ways to voice their sedition. Any who print anti-Harmony thoughts will be shuttered immediately and their employees arrested for the safety of the Empire."
  EQS_disband_parliament:0 "Disband Parliament"
  EQS_disband_parliament_desc:0 "The House of Lords has proven to be most obstinate in preventing any further legislation or laws from being passed if provided by the Empress, and has been actively trying to undermine her efforts by "restoring" Harmony. However, there is a little-remembered clause in the Empire's early agreements with the nobles that in times of crisis, the Empress can prorogue or shutter the house to further Harmony's protection. Enacting that privilege will finally end their nuisance."
  EQS_implement_night_curfews:0 "Establish Night Curfews"
  EQS_implement_night_curfews_desc:0 "Anything that requires meeting after the Empress's Sun has set clearly has ill intentions, as less ponies are alert or watching for anti-Harmony activity. Additionally, the thestrals, who are resisting our rule, are nocturnal, and are more likely to organize at night to plan for the Empire's downfall. Apprehending anypony seen at night without proper approval will reduce the risk of outright rebellion."
  EQS_round_up_suspected_changelings:0 "Round Up Suspected Changelings"
  EQS_round_up_suspected_changelings_desc:0 "The disgusting changelings are easily able to replace loyal citizens and infiltrate our defenses to spy us out or to foment discontent. However, they can't know everything there is about a pony, nor even pony culture, and anypony acting out of place when they weren't before is probably a changeling. Rounding them up will save us headaches in the future."
  EQS_arrest_open_communists:0 "Arrest Open Communists"
  EQS_arrest_open_communists_desc:0 "Communists were permitted to exist before, due to wishing to stay at peace with [STG.GetNameDef], but they have become a greater thorn in the Empress's side as of late. Whether brave or stupid, they usually flaunt their association. This will make it foal's play to lock them away for later judgement."

  #EQS_permit_equestria_games:0 "One Final Equestria Games"
  #EQS_permit_equestria_games_desc:0 "The §YEquestria Games§! are a tradition that many ponies have held onto for their entire lives and it is seen as something that has helped shape some of the social fabric of modern [EQS.GetAdjective] society. Since the Empress ascended, there have been no games held, and her subjects have begun to clamor for another. If she grants their wish, it shall be the last, since the antiquated mindset has no place in the Solar Empire and should be replaced."

  EQS_solar_fury_category:0 "An Alicorn's §OFury§!"
  EQS_solar_fury_category_desc:0 "It is a dreadful thing to corner an alicorn.\n\nOur enemies know not what they §Rsow§!."
  EQS_fury_of_sun:0 "§RUnleash the Power of the Sun!§!"
  EQS_fury_of_sun_desc:0 "The enemy is at our gates, but we are not without support. Our Empress guides our armies in the heat of battle and she is capable of destroying entire armies without our aid. If she were to unleash that power, all those that threaten us would fall like dead grass in her wake!"
  EQS_become_daybreaker_bop:0 "§RAscend§!"
  EQS_become_daybreaker_bop_desc:0 "The enemy is at our gates. Ponies perish. [EQS.GetNameDef] is collapsing. Salvation is near, but my ponies must be §Rready§!.\n\nThey [GetCelestiasBopPopularSupport]."
  EQS_CelestiasPopularSupport_max_evil_bop:0 "§Rwill follow me into the gates of Tartarus§!"
  EQS_militias_desc:0 "War has not touched §Y[ROOT.GetNameDef]§! for centuries. Although the government has the power to institute hard drafts of the populace in times of crisis, this power has never been utilized since it was signed into law, and mmost ponies would be hard-pressed to comply with letters of drafting. However, our ponies deeply love our country, and if we continue to suffer losses on the front, it may be enough to motivate them to join if the desperate hour arises."
  EQS_militias_penal_recruitment:0 "Press Penal Battalions"
  EQS_melt_our_foes:0 "Melt our Foes"
  EQS_melt_our_foes_desc:0 "Our enemies believe themselves safe and mock the very sun that our Empress commands. Do they not know that their mocking is like that of an fly against the wind? Nocreature is safe from the might of the Empress. Even the sun itself will turn itself against our foes. Let them bake in their homes and factories! Let them swelter and perish while we bask in her warmth!"
  EQS_pierce_the_heart:0 "Pierce the Enemy's Hearts"
  EQS_pierce_the_heart_desc:0 "While hidden behind their armored machines, our foes think themselves secure and invincible. Our Empress laughs at their foalish beliefs. Nothing is too secure from the power of magic. Their war machines shall be their tombs."
  EQS_endless_service:0 "Death is not the End"
  EQS_endless_service_desc:0 "Each of our soldiers has pledged, consciously or not, to serve the Empress and Order for eternity. Their deaths were only a small stumbling block in that oath. The Empress will not allow them to escape their promises so easily, for even death shall not separate her loyal ponies from herself."
  EQS_invincible_soldiers:0 "Undying Service"
  EQS_invincible_soldiers_desc:0 "Every soldier has a duty to defend [ROOT.GetNameDef] to their dying breath and even beyond, and we will not permit our foes the liberty of doing so. Let their tanks come. Allow their troops to march. Accept their shells and bullets. Through it all, our Empress will ensure that not one step back is taken and not one life will be lost."
  SOL_societal_unrest:0 "Solidify Control"
  SOL_societal_unrest_desc:0 "Our new regime is a tenuous one. Proportionally few ponies currently follow Daybreaker's lead and it is clear to all that Celestia is gone. If actions are not implemented swiftly to crack down on dissent and silence the harshest critics, any chance of saving them from themselves will be lost and there could very well be a new war on our hooves."
  SOL_location_of_luna_and_m6:0 "The [SOLGetAgencyName]'s Location of Luna and the Element Bearers"
  SOL_location_of_luna_and_m6_desc:0 "We have tried capturing the Empress's wayward sister and the Elements of Harmony's bearers once before, but our efforts were thwarted before we could accomplish our goal. Since then, [SOLGetAgencyName] has cautiously prepared new operations to return them to the Empress. According to current information, [GetLunaHostCountry] and [GetM6HostCountry]."
  SOL_lock_down_border:0 "Lock Down the Border"
  SOL_lock_down_border_desc:0 "Many ponies are attempting to flee [ROOT.GetNameDef] in the wake of [ROOT.GetLeader]'s awakening. We cannot allow these cowards to run and act like rats in a sinking ship. Harmony requires everypony to be present, and [ROOT.GetLeader] will have her loyal subjects."
  SOL_monitor_transportation_routes:0 "Monitor Transportation Routes"
  SOL_monitor_transportation_routes_desc:0 "As there are many ways out of [ROOT.GetNameDef] from our train and sea connections, it is impractical to guard them all. However, we can have agents monitor their interaries for any indivuals that may be of importance to [ROOT.GetLeader] and alert the military to apprehend them."
  SOL_implement_aerial_patrols:0 "Implement Airplane Spotter Patrols"
  SOL_implement_aerial_patrols_desc:0 "Our nation is vast and can be sparsely populated at times, which permits fugitives and criminals easy ways to hide. With the advent of modern flight, we can dedicate a portion of the air force to patrolling the rural areas to watch for ponies who may be trying to flee and inform authorities in the nearest settlement to hunt them down."
  SOL_approve_random_checkpoints:0 "Greenlight Random Checkpoints"
  SOL_approve_random_checkpoints_desc:0 "We have many road networks through [ROOT.GetNameDef] and that allows for long stretches of unwatched territory where ponies can meet and collude against [ROOT.GetNameDef]. Funding small groups of soldiers to patrol the roads and stop whomever they wish will catch at least a few anti-Harmony agitators."
  SOL_investigate_ponyville:0 "Investigate Ponyville's Castle"
  SOL_investigate_ponyville_desc:0 "Although Daybreaker's regime is now absolute, not everypony follows her completely. In alleyways and backrooms, many still believe that they must "free" Equestria from her reign. After a series of arrests in Manehattan from a series of organized strikes and one damaged factory, [ROOT.GetAgency] has learned that Starlight Glimmer, former friendship student of Twilight Sparkle, is involved with the Resistance. Although she has gone to ground, we must start somewhere, and that somewhere is Twilight Sparkle's former home: the Castle of Friendship."
  SOL_follow_fillydelphia_lead:0 "Follow Leads to Fillydelphia"
  SOL_follow_fillydelphia_lead_desc:0 "The clues found in Ponyville point to Starlight and Trixie spending some time in Fillydelphia, and there is a narrow list of places which they could have attended. Fillydelphia has been pacified, so it should not take long to find with whom they were going to meet."
  SOL_raid_ponyville_cottage:0 "Raid Old Ponyville Cottage"
  SOL_raid_ponyville_cottage_desc:0 "On the edge of Ponyville, there is a cottage that is almost within the Everfree Forest. Evidence obtained while searching the Castle of Friendship points to Starlight and Trixie going there to meet with a supplier. As it is abandoned and surrounded by hostile wildlife, there could be stashes of equipment, and perhaps an indication of where they went to next."
  SOL_raid_freeside_restaurant:0 "Raid Restaurant in Freeside"
  SOL_raid_freeside_restaurant_desc:0 "The information obtained in Fillydelphia points to a restuarant in Summerfield as a front for some Resistance members to meet and plan further insurrection. The proprieter is obviously complicit, and may very well know more of the whereabouts of further Resistance members, and perhaps the two public enemies, as well."
  SOL_investigate_new_horseleans_docks:0 "Investigate New Horseleans Docks"
  SOL_investigate_new_horseleans_docks_desc:0 "Although the Freeside information is scarce, there were a couple of letters between the restuarant owner Daffodil Drop and another member of the Resistance, which indicates that there is an information network within New Horseleans and that the dockyards are generally where Daffodil meets with her contacts. Scouring will take time, but capturing her alive will be well worth it."
  SOL_investigate_dead_drop:0 "Investigate Manehattan Dead Drop"
  SOL_investigate_dead_drop_desc:0 "The evidence found points to Manehattan being a frequent nexus of Resistance members exchanging information, which is not surprising given the extremely well-organized nature that most activity in that region experiences. Although we do not have a member for whom we can search, there is a location of a dead drop, as it recently changed, which gives us the perfect location to wait for a rebel agent to come looking for a communique."
  SOL_search_jungle_camp:0 "Search Abandoned Jungle Camp"
  SOL_search_jungle_camp_desc:0 "From what we have been able to gather through witnesses and searching the few possessions Daffodil Drop had, there appears to have been an encampent outside of New Horseleans where a number of Resistance members cooridnated some future attacks. Given how long it took us to find the information, it is unlikely we can catch anypony in the act, but there are bound to be clues that can be discovered."
  SOL_search_manehattan_opera_house:0 "Scour Manehattan Opera House"
  SOL_search_manehattan_opera_house_desc:0 "There was little to be gained from camping the dead drop, but after speaking to one pony, we learned that Trixie Lulamoon was seen there in the last couple of weeks, after the date of the letter regarding the dead drop location. Although it is a small chance, investigating the Manehattan Opera House, where she was last seen, could yield some fruit."
  SOL_raid_dodge_city_post_office:0 "Raid Dodge City Post Office"
  SOL_raid_dodge_city_post_office_desc:0 "The paper scraps in the New Horseleans camp have not yielded much, but on multiple there was a stamp of Dodge City on them. Dodge City is not large, and there are only a hoofful of post offices, especially those that are near the partial address on three of the scraps. If the offices are used a gateway for communication, it should not be hard to sniff it out."
  SOL_hunt_for_mareway_informant:0 "Hunt for Mareway Resistance Contact"
  SOL_hunt_for_mareway_informant_desc:0 "Among the half-burnt paper that we have reclaimed, a common name and location springs up in many of them. Sunrise Showers, a resident of Mareway, appears to be working with the Resistance, perhaps as a fence, perhaps as a proper member. A marehunt across all of Mareway will take some time, but capturing her alive will ideally give us a name or locations of recent Resistance meetings."
  SOL_raid_friendship_school:0 "Raid Ponyville Friendship School"
  SOL_raid_friendship_school_desc:0 "When the Empress's rule began, the School of Friendship in Ponyville was one of the first things to be shut down. Starlight and Trixie were both employees of the school, and it seems that they have used it as a meeting place in the past. There could be valuable information left behind there to bring us closer to stamping out this Resistance for good."
  SOL_investigate_raritys_manehattan_boutique:0 "Investigate Rarity's Manehattan Boutique"
  SOL_investigate_raritys_manehattan_boutique_desc:0 "Continuing to follow Trixie's scraps of information, we have been led to "Rarity for You," as there were receipts for a new cape and hat which were being custom-made by one of the tailors there. The owner, Coco Pommel, has been a loyal assistant to the Empire. Questioning her should be most frutiful."
  SOL_search_castle_for_clues:0 "Search for Clues in Everfree Castle"
  SOL_search_castle_for_clues_desc:0 "Evidence from the search of the School of Friendship point to the Everfree Forest, specifically, the Castle of the Two Sisters. A hidden, remote, and dangerous location such as it would pose a perfect staging ground for meetings and clandestine agreements. Since it is a desolate place, it should not take long to surface anything."
  SOL_find_information_in_canterlot_library:0 "Search [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Library for Information"
  SOL_find_information_in_canterlot_library_desc:0 "A piece of paper from our search of the old castle point to the head library of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as a safehouse and communications dispatch for the central region of the Empire. If we are able to apprehend a live Resistance member there, we should stand a strong chance of finding one of the heads of the Resistance."
  SOL_investigate_raritys_canterlot_boutique:0 "Investigate Rarity's [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Boutique"
  SOL_investigate_raritys_canterlot_boutique_desc:0 "It appears that [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Carousel is a hive of activity, and that multiple suspects have been seen going there in the last few months. With the latest clues, it's clear that its proprieter, Sassy Saddles, is involved. It is time that she is paid a visit."
  SOL_capture_sassy:0 "Capture Sassy Saddles"
  SOL_capture_sassy_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, Sassy Saddles was "away" on a business trip, which her underlinsg were reluctant to divulge originally. However, we now know that she is in Las Pegasus, ostensibly to broker business deals in the absence of Rarity, but more than likely an attempt to drum up more funding for the Harmonic Resistance. If we strike fast, we can still capture her, and finally learn all we need about the Resistance."
  SOL_destroy_resistance:0 "Crush the Resistance"
  SOL_destroy_resistance_desc:0 "With Sassy finally broken, we have learned the location of the next planned meeting of the different rebel cell heads. Prominent members include herself, Starlight Glimmer, Trixie Lulamoon, Limestone Pie, and others. We shall alert the Empress to this information, and we can expect the full weight of the military to come down upon them and finally rid us of rebellion forever!"
  SOL_mop_up_stragglers:0 "Mop Up the Stragglers"
  SOL_mop_up_stragglers_desc:0 "The Harmonic Resistance's leadership has been crushed. There is no chance that another organized insurgency of their influence and strength will rise again. However, they were still able to thwart our stability and order, and there are still some who need to be shown the path of enlightenment. With their leaders imprisoned or killed, it will not be difficult to wipe out what's left of the rabble, and return our lands to peace once more."
  SOL_choose_flagship:0 "Designing the Empress's Flagship"
  SOL_choose_flagship_desc:0 "As our naval doctrines have improved and the underlying technology of warfare has advanced, it's become clear that the old ships that were built before the Empress ascended are no longer adequate for somepony of her stature. It is time that we decide upon what shall bear her name to all the world and stand as a symbol of the Imperial Navy's unmatched might!"
  SOL_order_sunrise_to_front:0 "Order Sunrise Sparkle to the Front"
  SOL_order_sunrise_to_front_desc:0 "It is not fit for only one of the Empress's greatest and most trustest ponies, Dawnbreak Shimmer, to serve on the front lines while the Empress's protege stays behind. Although Sunrise Sparkle's work is important, she must also actively contribute to defend the Empire. She probably will have field tests in mind already, anyway."
  SOL_remove_civil_war_ideas:0 "Rescind Civil War Measures"
  SOL_remove_civil_war_ideas_desc:0 "The war is over. [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] stands victorious over the traitors in our midst. While the measures implemented to stave off Chaos have been useful, they are unneeded in our united state. Repealing them will prevent further resentment in the future."

Whether it is from their brethren who wish to see the Order of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s Harmony shattered or it is from those who are jealous of our prosperity and security, every day it is a struggle for our survival. While the Empress protects us, she cannot be everywhere at once. Therefore, we must expand who is able to do so.

From her parents and teachers, the radio and newspapers, the changeling menace was always something that was in the back of her, and many of her generation's minds. Although there never was a changeling infiltration like some ponies in Vanhoover feared, the backdrop of the threat shaped many of her early interests in military strategy. When Queen Chrysalis almost toppled the Equestrian government in 1002, it only further pushed the teen Arcane Nova to apply for every military academy that would potentially take her.\n\nAn appreciation for war in pre-dawn Equestria was looked upon as strange or frightening, but after acceptance into the class of 1005 to Fillydelphia Military Academy, her talent for analyzing combat situations and adapting to unexpected developments became apparent. When she set a new record for holding out in a scenario designed to be an impossible defense, she was transferred to Canterlot's academy to further refine her aptitude to war and war-related magic.\n\nIn the ensuing restructuring of the military after Daybreaker's ascension, her unwavering dedication to guarding Equestria and her astute observations earned her a position within the military science wing of the Solar Empire as well as a commission. When she was summoned by Daybreaker to personally oversee and ensure the loyalty of New Mareland, she was more than eager to prove her abilities to her Empress.\n\nIn New Mareland, she has guaranteed that there is nothing that can be used to question the Empress's decrees. Unrest has been met with disproportionate punishment, and any and all mention to Luna, thestrals, or other creatures of the night have been suppressed.

Although her abilities are unquestioned, her past has been shrouded in more mystery than her superiors would prefer.\n\nAccording to her recruitment file, she grew up in one of the prosperous families of Manehattan, although the only ponies who match her parents' names barely have earned their cutie marks. From her wealthy upbringing, she has had the opportunity to travel abroad, through the lands of Equus, Griffonia, and Zebrica, where she traveled off the beaten path, and practiced remaining unseen to experience the greatest sights. In her interview, she failed to elaborate on specifics of these trips.\n\nHowever, her enigmatic past is overshadowed by her ability to earn results. As an adept at remaining unseen, she has uncovered countless backroom deals in both the political and corporate sphere. On a couple of her reports, she pointed to information in places she never visited and were verified by other agents. How she obtains the details remains another mystery to the rest of her peers. When asked, she merely winks or informs them that it would be spoilers.\n\nShe has lived up to her promises in her initial recruitment. Competent and mysterious, she has yet to fail a mission, no matter where she is sent. Although her flirtatious, and sometimes psychotic behavior has led to fellow agents requesting transfers from operations conducted together, she does, in the end, exemplify the spirit of the Empire's intelligence community.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

Whether it is to hinder nations surrounding the Empire or keeping tabs on the citizens within it, he has either done it before or something close like it.\n\nGrowing up in Vanhoover, Absconditus utilized his wits to his advantage on the streets, when his family at times could barely afford the rent of even the cheapest subsidized housing. Through either subterfuge or guile, he frequently brought home enough food to survive when he wasn't in school, which turned into more elaborate heists as he grew older, leaving him an expert in winding the streets and avoiding undue attention. To him, harmony meant little when his family was destitute.\n\nIt was only when a S.M.I.L.E. agent stationed in Vanhoover as changeling activity became more worrying noticed him that his luck turned. Instead of arrest, as he had almost succeeded in stealing from the agent, he instead was given an offer to assist S.M.I.L.E., which he took, if grudgingly, however, his training was far from finished when the Solar Empire was declared. Within the Empire, his chances of advancement were far greater, as agents defected or were arrested for not bowing the knee to Daybreaker.\n\nAlthough still fresh, he has completely embraced the power and opportunity that the Solar Empire presents. Its idea of retooling harmony into something that works for everypony, instead of only those that are already advantaged, speaks to the wounds still smarting from his life in Vanhoover. Above all else, the order of Daybreaker must be preserved, and he will help guard against it, whenever the chance is given.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§!"
  POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_SOLAR_AGE_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography:§! Since the dawn of pony nations, there have been tales of two sisters, bearing the hallmarks of the three tribes. The magic of unicorns, the strength of earth ponies, and flight of pegasi. From the onset, the eldest took upon herself the greater task of raising the sun to warm and bless all, while the younger raised the moon as a guiding light. These myths morphed and changed each generation, but all pointed to the two sisters, Princesses Celestia and Luna.\n\nLittle is known about their origin, as in the time of the three tribes, they appeared to lead the fledgling nation of Equestria, taking the mantle of the heavenly bodies, and guided all their new subjects into harmony. Through their example, they encouraged everypony to tolerate, love, and care for each other.\n\nTime can sour the strongest relationships, however, and eventually Luna's soul was burdened with jealousy for her sister's recognition. By striking out as Nightmare Moon, she showed the first crack in the otherwise serene and loving diarchs. With Nightmare Moon's banishment, Celestia assumed sole leadership of a broken Equestria, which she healed in time through sweat and tears. For a thousand years, her ponies were protected from all that threatened them by their Princess. No compensation was requested nor expected, as she loved her ponies like a mother does their children.\n\nIn the modern era, countries deride the idea of compassion, and war's onslaught, with the blood, death, and ruin that it brings unveils that the beliefs and ideals of a millennia-old mindset have run their course. Although Celestia tried, Harmony could not be preserved. A mother's love was tested by every lost battle that transpired.\n\nUltimately that love pushed her to new heights. As her ponies suffered, Celestia's purpose changed. Protection came not from the pen, but the sword. Embracing the fires of her wrath, Celestia, now ascended as Daybreaker Sun, reformed the impotent Equestria into an efficient and orderly Empire. While her ponies may protest at the radical and sudden alterations, it is irrelevant. All she needs is a nation ready to lay down its life to guard Harmony from all threats, within and without.\n\n§YPortraits By:§! RyanBoi, Avrameow, and December Breeze"
  chancellor_neighsay_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! §L7th of December, 954 ALB in Canterlot§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §LAs the head of the EEA, Neighsay has served Equestria in ensuring a consistent educational standard for all ages for over two decades, since he was inducted to his position as chancellor when the previous EEA head, Ink Blot, retired. Although part of a minor family of the Canterlot elite, he rarely speaks of his background as a point of pride. According to him, his parents were rather uninspired and were completely content to remain in their position of wealth and obscurity, but he was not.\n\nAfter studying in Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns with a degree in advanced abdjuration and conjuration magic, he penned a number of papers that ultimately earned the attention of the EEA, where he was made a board member to oversee the quality of magical education within Equestria. Once he was appointed as the new chancellor, various reforms and revisions passed through his office, all of which were instantly approved. While none of his changes were against the ideals of Harmony as advocated by Celestia per se, new red tape for "grade standards" prevented many non-ponies, and even thestrals, from attending any EEA-accredited institution.\n\nWhen Twilight Sparkle opened her School of Friendship, he was quick to vocalize his and the EEA's distrust of the non-ponies allowed to attend, although ultimately he was forced to allow it to operate outside of the EEA when Cozy Glow's plans to siphon all magic from the land was exposed. However, he remains a staunch advocate of the "quality" education that the EEA provides and remains a voice for stricter interaction with outside nations that don't "understand ponykind's needs."§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §Lphp97§!"

From an early age, she showed an aptitude to various musical styles and instruments, reflecting in her cutie mark of music. According to her, her formative years allowed her to express her true self and explore what she enjoyed, which directly carried into her earliest work, before she was noticed by the great recording labels of Manehattan.\n\nWhen she was young, she befriended Applejack, Element of Honesty, although the friendship quickly cooled when she tried her luck in Manehattan. Although she was not spotted immediately, her former manager, Svengallop, did eventually allow her to audition, and he immediately took her on. For years, he controlled her every public move, and most of her releases, which, while popular, were never exactly what Coloratura truly wanted.\n\nIn 1005, Coloratura accepted an invitation by Princess Twilight Sparkle to perform at the Helping Hooves Music Festival, which Svengallop agreed to for the public relations boost it would provide. During that time, she reconnected with Applejack and finally had the veil lifted from her eyes regarding Svengallop's manipulations. In the aftermath, Coloratura has become an independent artist, and Equestria's most popular mare. Although she has self-published her recent work, with an album released in 1006 to raving reviews, she still wishes to please all her fans, and her concerts are a mix of both her own and Svengallop-influenced music.§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §LDecember Breeze§!

Although born in Rijekograd proper, she lived most of her formative years on a simple farm hundreds of kilometers away, where she spent most of her time whittling away the hours either watching gourds grow or helping her parents with odds and ends. Throughout her latter years at the farm, she frequently was compared to her more successful, well-known cousin, River Swirl, who was seen as the crown jewel of the Swirl extended family after being accepted into Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns.\n\nAlthough she harbored no ill will toward her cousin, Pumpkin's already minuscule desire to make a name for herself, at the constant pushing by her parents and later her Baba, crumbled further when River returned in 997 ALB and started running for politics. At her parents' decision, Pumpkin attended one of the smaller, local universities within Rijekograd for a major in economics, as the government's focus was set on alleviating growing poverty issues within the country.\n\nAside from a brief visit to River, at River's expense, in Equestria, it was Pumpkin's first time living away from home. While in university, the meek mare made a few friends, whom assisted in breaking her out of her shell, at least somewhat. However, despite graduating with slightly above average grades, the years were never kind on Pumpkin. She gain a low-level career within River Swirl's government, where she remained until Rijekograd was taken by Daybreaker's forces.\n\nSeen as a pony with a recognizable name, Daybreaker appointed her regional governess of the newly organized Rivers of the Sun protectorate. Thrust with unexpected, and unwanted, responsibility, Pumpkin has much to prove. So long as she isn't pushed around by Daybreaker much like her Baba did.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Stephen Sen"
  dawnbreak_shimmer_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! §L23rd of March, 974 ALB in Tall Tale§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §LFor years, Dawnbreak Shimmer was wayward from the Empress's embrace, as despite her natural talent for magic - especially infernal spells - from a young age, studying at the Empress's own school for the most talented unicorns, and earning the admiration and love of the Empress herself, it was not enough. Ambition drove the young Dawnbreak to seek dark avenues to further her power and force an ascension to become an alicorn. When the Empress denied her, promising in time that she would gain her reward, Dawnbreak's impatience took control of her, and after an altercation, she fled through a magical mirror to another world.\n\nHowever, her time was not wasted, as she learned to control herself and her power, and when the Empire needed her most, she returned. Yet she was not ready to accept the Empress's teachings again, and required correction. When she was restored properly to the Empress, she pledged to protect Harmony and Order at any cost, and has followed that promise with full gusto, driving fear into the enemies of the Solar Empire.\n\nAs one of the strongest unicorns within the Empire, she serves faithfully and has had her relationship with her mother figure repaired. When she is not leading on the battlefield or assisting with internal matters, she is spending time with the Empress as both a de facto bodyguard and as an adoptive daughter of sorts. Her perceptive nature of ponies' underlying emotions is uncanny, but she has used it only for detecting potential, disloyal elements of the Empire.\n\nWith her true purpose restored, her drive for success has led to victory after victory on the battlefield. The enemies of the Empress cower when they learn of Dawnbreak's presence in combat, and she guarantees that all will face the strong arm of the Empress's righteous judgement.§L\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LMoonatik§!"

As the Element of Loyalty, she remains rigidly devoted to her friends and to Harmony, and is one of the lead members of the Wonderbolts, Equestria's premier flight team. However, her beginnings are as humble as the average pony, although she received much adoration and encouragement from her parents. Said parents are still her biggest fans.\n\nWhen she was a filly, she already began to show predilections for standing by her friends, as she stood up for her oldest companion, Fluttershy, throughout their shared years in school. Every flying competition she could enter she did, which soon earned her a reputation of both an excellent flier, but also a braggart, as the number of trophies she had continued to climb. On a dare, she agreed to race her rivals, and in the last stretch, sped past the sound barrier to release a sonic rainboom, the only pony to do so.\n\nAfter she earned her cutie mark, she continued to improve her athletic performance, and moved to Ponyville after Fluttershy found her a spot on the local weather team. In her off time, she focused solely on joining the Wonderbolts, and one day did, after Twilight Sparkle's friendship helped to smooth out some of her extremely brash nature and supposedly help with a hidden self-confidence issue. She still remains competitive and arrogant, and her new position as one of the chiefs of staff for Equestria has done nothing to damper them. Yet, when she is in small groups or alone with others, she may still bluster, but she will stand by anypony she knows and who stands up for Harmony.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

Fires have burned away the fear and trepidation, replaced the dross with the scorching red-hot strength of steel. Where once Princess Celestia trembled and quaked at the thought of leading her ponies to war, the Empress, Daybreaker Sun, proudly strides, no doubt in her mind of victory. No longer does she need her sister; no longer does she need the guidance of ponies who think them her better; no longer does she need to resist the power the Sun gives her. She is everything. She is Harmony.\n\nAs everything that Celestia was not, Daybreaker displays her might for any and all to see. In commanding troops, she is ruthless, calculating, and aggressive. If there is a cost to pay to ensure victory, then she will surely pay it with the blood of her soldiers, all to keep Harmony safe and Order alive within the Solar Empire.

Blueblood's great-grandmother was peace-loving, kind, and empathetic. Blueblood is none of those.\n\nWhen he was young, Blueblood flaunted his position as the Princess's "only family" – even if it was not through blood – and pestered or tormented almost the entire castle staff in Canterlot. Eventually that brattiness gave way to inexorable boredom and malaise at the doldrums of royal life. Between being the poster stallion of toying with mares, or making a mockery of his supposed friends through hosting parties that he ultimately never attended, or creating scandals where there were none, Blueblood never truly grew up from the immature colt that jeered how he had the ear of Celestia. At least, that was before the invasion of Canterlot in 1002.\n\nBetween his honor and very ponyhood being challenged by Rarity in 1001 at the Grand Galloping Gala, his priorities shifted. The changeling invasion was the final straw. After it was repelled – and he thoroughly expressed his disgust of the "bugs" – he purchased a commission through some old laws and soon became a field marshal of Equestria. However, he has had little time to prove himself, despite his drive to lead. This eagerness has left him critical of anything that doesn't meet his standards, and officers frequently complain about his overly harsh treatment of them. Whether this foalish attitude will remain in the face of real war can only remain to be seen.§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §LScroup§!"

The oldest of five brothers and one sister, most of the day-to-day responsibilities of the house fell to him as he grew older, so both his parents could continue working in the industrial sawmills that provided the household with the financial freedom to vacation across Equestria. From the great mountains that stretch across the central spine of Equestria to the frozen plains of Severyana, every trip was a new adventure, and exposed him to many of the different regional cultures in the country.\n\nAs Allen matured, he felt another wanderlust, and as the Royal Guard was currently recruiting, with stations across the country, he volunteered and was soon placed within Princessyn. Although his unit was stationed in city when the Revolution of 995 began, he never saw action, as it was just as his squad was being rotated out. He participated in the defense against the changeling invasion of Canterlot, where his experience in Whinnyapolis played a role in helping dozens of citizens evade the attackers.\n\nAfterward, for his bravery, he was given a commendation and promoted, with a stipulation to begin training other troops in his survival know-how.

As a filly, her upbringing was that of a staunchly pro-Celestia and pro-Harmony household, to the point of near veneration of Princess Celestia for the guidance and protection that she gave. This adoration turned fanatical upon Daybreaker's ascension, where the promise of strength, order, and unity against those that would see Harmony fall to ruin resonated with her.\n\nThe city of Manehattan, after all, while a bright light of multiculturalism and the friendship between various species, had its troubles. Sometimes ponies were taken advantage of. Infrequently, more aggressive crimes were reported on. Much came to a head when one of her close friends, Nebula Flare, was injured by a dispute between a griffon and yak, which involved various police officers, and when it turned even more violent, some of the national guard. In the aftermath, the false light of Equestria's stagnant Harmony stank, reeking of hypocrisy. When Daybreaker proclaimed her new order and declared herself a goddess, the threads of worship that already had been woven into Aurora's mind fully took root.\n\nThe Empress finally brought order to Manehattan, and when the Solaris Inquisitionis sought to expand its numbers of faithful ponies, she heed the call. Zeal and drive pushed every new inquisitor more than true education, and after a year-long study under another mage, Aurora partook in the trials of the Holy Flame and emerged a scorched, yet devoted adherent to the God-Empress's will.\n\nSince her induction as a mage in the Inquistionis, she has risen to be one of the youngest archmages in the Order, and has been left with the responsibility of watching over her hometown. While still green, she has eagerly volunteered to be one of the God-Empress's representatives within the military, and leads with characteristic harsh, strict discipline that the Inquistionis instills within all its inquisitors.§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §LScroup§!"

A total of seven Captains of the Guard and three aides to the Captain of the Guard run in his family line, and some have even been given the honor of being the personal bodyguard of Princess Celestia, when times called for it.\n\nWith this pedigree, it is unsurprising that he also enrolled within the Canterlot Military Academy to receive a commission as an officer of the Equestrian Royal Guard. After graduation, he was placed in command of one of the main divisions that later saw action with the invasion of Canterlot. Unlike many of the other commanders, his unit held, and an entire section of the city remained changeling free for the entire duration of the brief war. In recognition for his defense, he was granted a Pink Heart by both Princesses, and promoted to General, a position he still maintains.\n\nHis no-nonsense demeanor sometimes rubs his other officers the wrong way, but nopony can argue with his results.

An energetic colt, he frequently explored the city while his parents were selling their crops in the market, and more than once nearly caused heart attacks when he disappeared to only turn up a few hours later, and after frantic searching by his family.\n\nWhen a number of ponies struck out to settle a promising location in the Mild West just north of recognized buffalo territory, he struck out with them and helped found the town of Appleloosa. After learning of how fertile the ground was around the town, a number of his extended family also moved to the region, establishing additional orchards to help feed the hungry settlement. Despite his physical strength, he is a pacifist, and avoided participating in the short-lived Apple War, but has been part of the delegation that provides pies for the buffalo every year as part of the treaty for continuing to use their sacred land.\n\nEnergetic and bubbly, but also serious when required, it caused Applejack no small amount of consternation when she learned that he also applied for a field officer position in the Equestrian military.

Little has been shared by her of her past, and while her superiors remain content, with Hollow Shades remaining one of the lowest locations of heresy or apostasy, it does raise questions with her fellow mages and archmages.\n\nWhat has been shared of her upbringing explains at least part of her demeanor toward the subjects of her Inquisitionis chapter. Born in a multi-generational household, she frequently interacted with the majority thestral population of Hollow Shades where she was seen as an outsider and stranger rather than the opposite. Before the God-Empress proclaimed her empire, Burning worked in one of the local schools, where she used some of her pyrotechnical knowledge to entertain and grasp the attention of foals like no other during her lessons.\n\nThis experience with younger minds played into her interest in leadership, as she sees the Inquisitionis more as a way of enlightening and educating ponies how to work in harmony than as a weapon to threaten the populace with. When she volunteered to undergo training by the Inquisitionis, she tempered her submission with a request that she lead Hollow Shades, for she knew it better than anypony appointed from Sanctum Solar or elsewhere, and that she would keep the city in line. Although her instructors voiced doubts, she still received her appointment upon finishing her tutoring, and she has indeed kept her promise since.\n\nNow with another request from the God-Empress for more ponies to serve, Burning has offered her skills.

Raised in a small household, Caltrop's early foalhood was characterized by almost constant poverty, as the great city of Manehattan lived up to its fame of extremes. As he matured, steady work for both him and his father allowed them to move out of the slums they once called home, but still exist far from any life of luxury.\n\nWhile his formal education was lacking, his street smarts and ingenuity allowed him to pick up on many of the new inventions that transformed factory work. With each new addition to an assembly line, he learned it inside and out, and eventually could build an entire car by himself, if he was given the opportunity. This knowledge applied to move out of the factory itself, and instead establish a small mechanic's shop on the outskirts of the city.\n\nWhen war came knocking to Equestria, he eagerly signed up to help defend his home, his parents, and all that he knew, as it was only through the freedom that the diarchy brought that he was able to claw his way out of poverty.

In many ways, she outstrips the knowledge of warships of both her superiors, Cynosura and Madoor Stronghammer. As she grew up in the southern port of Stableside, she has had thousands of hours exposed to ships and their inner workings, thanks to her family's shipping business, as well as privately owned freighters. From an early age, she accompanied her mother as she inspected the different ships, as well as performed routine maintenance on them, aided by the dedicated engineers employed by the company.\n\nWhereas her counterparts all trained at prestigious academies across Equestria, Copper only had her own experience to guide her in forging herself into the capable leader she is today. When she reached the age of eighteen, earned a job working with the other contractors constructing one of Protector Class battleships that was laid down in Stableside, where she had exposure to the guts what made a warship run. From bulkheads to decking, power delivery to rudders, she ensured to lap up anything and everything she could learn, and after it was finished just before her twenty-second birthday, she went on to found her own ship-building company, although it was a far cry from anything military-related.\n\nIt was only through her extensive knowledge of warships that she was considered for induction into Equestria's navy, after it went through a revitalization with Madoor Stronghammer at the head. Although she had very little simulation experience, her ability to analyze any weakness of a ship, whether hers or the enemy's, and instinctively know where problem areas are after sustaining damage has proven a quasi-omniscience. After respectfully pointing out flaws in the Pegasopolis aircraft carrier, she was given special promotion to rear admiral, where she functions effectively as Madoor's aide.

When she was young, she tended to race around the streets and parks of Neighagra Falls, which frequently got her into trouble with both her friends' parents after crashing into one too many windows, and also trained her to quickly map out cities with little advance intelligence. In her teen years, one of her jaunts through Neighagra Falls ended up with her flying a tad close to the falls themselves. She was torn from the sky and battered by the water and rocks below.\n\nThrough luck or protection from something above, she only had one of her wing bones shattered beyond healing, among some broken limbs and bruises, but was forced to use a prosthetic ever after. However, the loss of one of her wings didn't deter her, and while she became slower, she still had the drive for adventure and for a higher purpose, and enlisted within the Royal Guard.

Growing up in the town of Chinamitl, there was nothing to do but survive and claw as much of an existence as one could muster. Siblings squabbled and sometimes fought each other in the streets for food, parents occasionally had to go into nothing more than indentured servitude to provide for their families, and the threat of being eaten or killed by the roving animals in the jungle surrounding the town were always hanging over the thestrals' heads. Of the few that made it out, they never turned around to see their old home again.\n\nIn some circles, it was called Equestria's armpit's armpit. Although it was helped by the reforms that were put in place regarding thestral rights, it was still far from an ideal place to live. Comet Trail only got by through his knack for ingenuity and his speed at snatching salvage faster than others. When recruiters came from Equestria's military, spending only a single afternoon looking for volunteers, he signed up without a second thought.\n\nDespite the prejudice which still dominated much of the military, Comet's skill for scavenging was acknowledged as an asset. His squad was never a drain on supplies, and after a couple of successful skirmishes, he was promoted to second lieutenant, where he slowly crawled his way through the ranks, which sped up as the war progressed. With Daybreaker's ascension, he is still mistrusted, and some of the lost stigma has returned, but nopony questions him. So long as he keeps a low profile, as he has thus far, he has little to fear.

He was not stationed in the city at the time, instead in Acornage, where a few infiltrator teams attempted to disrupt the city, which at that time was completely unaware of what was happening in the capital.\n\nHis squad successfully deduced the infiltration, and he arrested a number of the changeling agitators, which afterward earned him a placement as a commissioned officer, and assignment in the stabilization of the situation in Canterlot under newly-minted Captain Capsaicin.

Yet in the end, she did.\n\nOriginally, Crimson Line worked with her parents in their accounting practice, studying to become another certified accountant, like them, and learning the ins and outs of the Equestrian economy. However, the city of Bridlepolis, while a distance away from Manehattan and further still from Fillydelphia, was influenced by some of the communist rhetoric that escaped the universities and the strikes organized from time to time. Crimson, like many younger ponies, was swept up in the craze of protest, not for Caramel Marks' ideology, but against it. When a crowd of ponies was permitted to organize in favor of Stalliongrad's recent, successful revolution, she crafted her own, counter-protest.

Whenever she wasn't at school or playing with her friends, Cynosura would be on the docks of Manehattan, watching the various ships, from the lowliest of schooners to the great cruise ships to the enormous freighters carrying all manner of goods from afar to Equestria. Frequently she'd listen in on chatter from dockhoofs and sailors alike, learning of the strange lands of Zebrica or the place of opportunity that was the Equestrian colony of New Mareland. Every story awed her, as she imagined herself sailing the high seas one day to explore the grand expanses of water and waves, for fun, profit, or homeland, if not all three.\n\nAs she grew older, she began to study in her own time naval history and tactics after seeing the construction of the then-new Star Swirl Class dreadnoughts. At every opportunity, she extolled her parents about Equestria's long naval pedigree, and they supported her in her desire to enroll Manehattan's naval academy.

Although there was little way to gain combat experience, her theoretical knowledge expanded and elevated her to a position of admiral, one of the youngest in Equestria's recent history.

As a Vanhooverian, he was always in and around the sea, as the port provided shelter from the frigid waters around Olenia and the changeling queendoms. Every morning, when his parents left for their drudgery that they called jobs, which worked them within inches of their lives continuously, he saw the great freighters from across the ocean from the River Coalition and elsewhere come in for refueling. Usually, they were on to other ports, such as Las Pegasus or Stableside, but some were for Vanhoover itself.\n\nAs his family had little, it was a blessing that some of his relatives in the city could assist in getting him into Vanhoover's local university, where he initially went to study an agricultural degree. However, after one of Olenia's fleets after an exercise had to make emergency port in the city, he saw his first, true warships, not the castoffs that the Equestrian Navy stationed in the city, and his true interest took root. He applied for the naval academy in Las Pegasus, and was accepted. From there, he performed adequately, although another junior officer's handling of munitions in a training drill left him scarred on the right side.\n\nAfter graduation, he received his commission as captain, and battled with numerous pirate bands along the southern fringes of Equestria. Over time, due to his outspoken views on how ponies like him back in Vanhoover were struggling and were failed by the Princess, he gained a reputation for never holding back, either in the board room or on the sea.

Even as a minuscule filly, she went aboard her father's fishing boat – for the griffon and other non-herbivorous residents of the city – which he took to various spots around the calm inward portion of the Eclipse Gulf. By the time she was ten, she could name every part of the ship, as well as give orders herself.

Although it was difficult to afford traveling to Fillydelphia's naval academy, she nonetheless gained a spot there, and earned a number of scholarships based on her remarkable performance in the classroom and in field exercises. As she neared the end of her tenure at the college, she was granted the opportunity to command a decommissioned destroyer as additional field experience. Although it was a routine patrol around the Spa Islands, her ship was ambushed by a number of pirates, which had the tactical advantage. Or so they thought.\n\nWhile individually they were lightly armed compared to the destroyer and not dangerous, the number in which they descended upon her ship was. Yet with the limited weaponry she wielded, she not only sunk most of the pirates, but prevented enough damage to ensure the ship was not scuppered. When she returned with her battered destroyer, after debriefing, she was immediately promoted to vice admiral and later admiral for her command and her nickname earned in the chaos of the battle, the Nightmare of Solomane, immortalized in Equestrian naval history.

As Acornage is the only city in Equestria where changelings openly live, that potentiality was always present, even if it was rarely on ponies' minds before Chrysalis's invasion of Canterlot. This upbringing, though, where, even subconsciously, the doubt of if the pony you were speaking to was truly them left a lasting impression.\n\nAt first, Fireflight merely helped run the family business, a shop of various silken goods—common in Acornage—as well as be part of the community watch. Like most ponies in Acornage, he was on friendly terms with the changeling citizens, until it soured after 1002. When news reached Acornage of Canterlot falling to changelings and only being rescued through sheer luck, Firelight did what any true-blooded Equestrian pony would do: he enlisted, without protest from his parents, despite him at one point being expected to continue the business.\n\nIn boot camp, he quickly was noticed for his aggressive tactics and rapid, almost foolhardy assaults. However, since that was sorely lacking in the Equestrian military, it earned him enough respect that he was transferred to the officer corps and studied general warfare further. His battle plans are characterized by swift, decisive action, and with the advent of mechanized warfare, he has adapted to it more quickly than most, something that more of the high command wishes of its other officers.§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §LScroup§!"

Although she has been forward with being raised deep in the jungles of the South-East, when she offered to provide her expertise in service of the Empress, many of her claims about herself couldn't be verified. According to her, she was orphaned as a filly, but the claims surrounding her entire family's death vary from report to report. Sometimes, they're killed by a roving warband of Neighua while hunting in the jungle, another time, they perished while trying to flee a skirmish between her town's militia and tribals. The only detail that's concrete is it involved the Neighua in some way.\n\nDue to her time living on the streets, destitute, in the already poverty-stricken South-East, she learned how to survive and even to thrive with few resources, and while stranded in hostile conditions. During her first year on her own, she has claimed that she lived only because of the rotten fruit she could find and the occasional animal she was forced to eat. When she grew older, she left her town, although not its region entirely, instead living off the jungle and occasionally offering various services in town.\n\nMost of her goods were tools, and some of her skills proffered included woodworking and stone masonry, as well as being a guide to those who wished to see the jungle and some of the long-lost temples of the Neighua and Moonspeakers. Thanks to her years living in the thickest portions of the peninsula, she was one of the most popular, at least for first-time tourists. She rarely had repeat customers.\n\nFrom her time forced to live on the street and in the jungle, she has a biting, sarcastic style of leadership, and frequently chooses the most ruthless ways to attack enemies she's pitted against. Cruel at points, some of her soldiers claim that she secretly leads a small moon cult sect, separate from that of the Moonspeakers. None have lived to back up the accusation, however, as they frequently end up on the frontlines a couple of days afterward.\n\nGushing denies any involvement.§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §LFalafel Jake§!"

For Ksen Autumn, it was not the verdant trees that welcomed him home every day, but the ruins of the City of the Sun, where he and his family lived along the outskirts, in a small ghetto by even tribal standards. As the Neighua see thestrals as an affront to sun goddess, whom they believe is Princess Celestia, prejudice in his life was the norm. Yet it was all he knew.\n\nDespite the oddity, his family were staunch believers in Celestia's own deity, much like the tribals around them, and there was always hope that one day she'd provide support for her forgotten ponies. As the rulership of the South-east transitioned from Celestia to Daybreaker, the Neighua grew more belligerent, until freshly stationed troops by Daybreaker crushed a mob that sought to burn down the same ghetto that Ksen lived in.\n\nWithin weeks, recruiters seeking fresh blood from the Neighua and the thestrals, however misguided they were said to be, to serve in Daybreaker's army. At the promise of working with the sun goddess and having a better life for himself, Ksen joined, and soon was given a commission within the military.

Although mythicized through time, the tales of two sisters, the elder bearing the light of the sun, the younger the embrace of the moon, have remained the same. While these pre-dated the Equestrian diarchy, when Princesses Celestia and Luna arrived in the nascent nation, all recognized they were the alicorns spoken of for hundreds of years.\n\nAs one of the two reigning Princesses of Equestria, Princess Luna worked with her sister, Celestia, to protect Equestria from harm and save her ponies from threats that wandered into their borders. She and her sister's triumphs over King Sombra, Discord, and Lord Tirek have become those of legends. Yet despite her help, Celestia was always the more recognized of the two, which rotted Luna's soul in resentment and soured her love for her citizens. When she was banished, the few remaining societal memories of her warped into old mares' tales or bedtime stories. Until she returned to seek vengeance.\n\nAfter she was purified by the Elements of Harmony, Luna has been reintroduced to the world, with Celestia offering as much support as she can. Although the modern Equestria is overwhelming, Luna has taken to it quickly, and as the warrior counterpart to Celestia, has returned to active military duty. She is a sound strategist, and perhaps the greatest military mind alive today, simply due to her centuries of experience.

From his very youngest memories, he has been enraptured by the sea, watching the ships roll into Fillydelphia's port. Whenever he had the free time, he'd help with the dockhoofs with unloading the cargo, or at the least listen to the tales of the dangers of the sea that the sailors would provide to any young, wide-eyed colt with open ears. As his family lived paycheck to paycheck, he could barely afford to spend time as he got older on the docks, yet as a final, last-ditch attempt to stay on the seas, he applied for being a hand on a local freighter, which was heading to Maregypt.\n\nAlong the way, the sea fully called to him. The rock of the waves, the din of the gulls near the shore, the sapphire water out on the open waters, all of it, lit his passion for sailing the oceans. After a couple of stints on the freighter, he earned enough to take one semester at the naval academy in Manehattan, where he met another young seapony at heart, Cynosura. Almost immediately the two hit it off, and while he did work through his entire time at the academy, she convinced her parents to help prop him through his education.\n\nLike Cynosura, he graduated near the top of his class, just slightly ahead of her, and earned a commission of commodore. However, Cynosura was rooted in the old ways of naval thought, and while she was quite competent, he adapted. As the airplane became more prominent, and Equestria began to experiment with carriers for them, he began to craft rules of engagement for them, and tested them in wargames. Only he was able to best Cynosura consistently, and he was promoted to admiral, along with her, where he was given the liberty to re-envision the navy into a modern tool to protect Equestria's waters.\n\nHe and Cynosura are still friends, but they are rivals in thought. While she wishes for large guns to deter enemies, he would prefer swift strikes from carrier-based craft to cripple fleets before any engagement even happens. At the moment, he remains favored, but whenever his theories get put into practice, that will be when it can be truly determined who is right.§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §LScroup§!"

However, this has not been as part of it, but as an aid to it. She, herself comes from a middle-class family, and as a portion of her schooling that would have destined her for a respectable career in accounting or secretarial aid, she was placed in one of the faux-noble family houses to learn and further study. As an aide to members of the Corona household, she brushed shoulders with various members of Celestia's Day Court, and also met the Princess herself multiple times.\n\nThese interactions with Princess Celestia left a lasting impression on Midwinter, who pivoted from serving just the Corona family to instead seek out a position within Celestia's administration itself. During the changeling invasion of Canterlot in 1002, she was captured by infiltrators and attempted to be sucked dry of any emotion and love that was still in her. While she did fend for herself, it was only through a couple of sacrifices from the Guard that she didn't end up in a pod meant for Vesalipolis. After the invasion, the attack left her jumpy, but as she was just starting her post-secondary education, she could do little else than continue along the path she was on.\n\nAs one of the Castle's staff, she handled the organization of the gardening teams and outdoor events. When war came to Equestria, however, she quit the very same day and enlisted in the Equestrian military, where her administrative skills were quickly picked up on. She was transferred to Caltrop Decay's unit, before soon earning her own command as a captain. However, her aggression kept her from earning promotions, until Daybreaker recognized her loyalty and devotion to not just Harmony, but to her.\n\nMidwinter has now achieved all that she desires. She obeys the Empress without question, and her soldiers follow in fear. For a little filly from a no-name family, now everypony in the Empire's military knows her.

Although exciting, it was wholly unsurprising that her own cutie mark was related to the forest and flora, although its much more cryptic bush with the sun rising overhead remained enigmatic for years.\n\nAfter she rescued a stray filly who had wandered from the town and gotten lost, her true calling resonated with her. The adrenaline rush of stalking the two timberwolves that followed the foal, and surprising them and hacking them down with her hatchet, awoke something inside. Only a day after returning to her parents' cabin, she enlisted within the Royal Guard, where she learned standards of war, but also was identified as a pony effectively married to the wilderness. She graduated, and then studied to be an instructor for the Guard and military, something she held until after Daybreaker's ascension.\n\nWith a promise of taking the fight to any who would endanger Harmony, Morning volunteered to join active service. Her knowledge of survival training and the wilderness is next to none, perhaps only rivaled by Neighua tribe members and thestrals in the South-East.

Nor is she any more loyal or fanatical than any other inquisitor. Nor is she driven to strive for great heights, like so many of her figurative sisters within the order. However, what she lacks in all of these things, she makes up for with a single, overarching trait that has placed her in positions of authority over more skillful ponies than she. She is competent. If something is said to be done, it will be done, quickly, efficiently, and ruthlessly.\n\nAlthough reluctant to talk about her past, she admits to living on the streets in Summerdale for months after being orphaned through a series of accidents that claimed her parents. When she was finally taken in by a home, her stern and hardened demeanor from the time homeless clashed with her adoptive family, leading to consistent, and slowly escalating, strife between them. Unlike many of the other inquisitors who have helped to burgeon the numbers after the God-Empress legalized the Solaris Cultus, Nova was inducted well before it was made public. Although there were only a few cult members within Summerdale, shortly after she gained a cutie mark in infernal magic, she was approached by the parent of an acquaintance at her school. With only a brief offer of true acceptance, she agreed to join, and punish those who would clash against one of Daybreaker's chosen ponies.\n\nHer adoptive family disappeared. To this day, she remains silent on the subject and never discusses them for long. Rightly so, she focuses more on the tasks at hoof than reminiscing. As a mage in the Inquisitionis, she has enough of a grasp of magic to be a threat, and understands her way around combat.

For most of her time as a filly, she either spent it studying magic or history, or helped look after Tenebris, who sometimes was prone to fits beyond most infants' range. Although she was never very interactive when Tenebris was but small foal, her presence always seemed to calm her sibling. With this in mind, she originally studied for a medical position in Fillydelphia, a path she was well under way toward when the God-Empress proclaimed the Solar Empire.\n\nWhen the Inquisitionis sought more ponies to guard Harmony, Novus volunteered as it kept both her sister safe, given Tenebris was prone to sharing to all her love of Luna and what a role model she was, and because the Inquisitionis provided a way for her to minister, and keep ponies just that smidgen safer. For it to be in service to Celestia, no matter what she called herself, would be a great honor.\n\nAlthough she commands with authority, Novus rarely lords it over her soldiers' heads.

She was frequently in and out of school, as her behavior remained cause for alarm for her schoolmasters as a potential danger to other foals around her. It was said that her delusions of might and conquest, were unbefitting a pony in peace-loving Equestria. Time and again, the recommendation, and requirement, of returning to school was psychiatric evaluation and treatment. Yet they only ever found a normal filly, who sometimes had bouts of a superiority complex.\n\nAs she lived in one of the sunniest places in all of Equus, conveniently named Sunny Shoals, her obsessions also turned to the sun and the one who controlled it, Princess Celestia. She had power. She clearly could vest it in others in her confidence. Therefore, Quasar would serve Celestia with all her heart, to be blessed with this same strength.

Even as a hatchling, Argynnis was instructed in aspects of warfare, as she would one day succeed her mother, either because the queen would die in glorious battle, or perish at the hooves of Argynnis herself when she became strong enough. Neither of those things ultimately happened, as Vraks's shaky relationship with Vesalipolis and Queen Chrysalis eventually turned sour and the martial hive was crushed in a decisive defeat by an alliance of hives led by Chrysalis. Rather than face the humiliation of dying at the hooves of a rival in a crumbling hive, Argynnis's mother committed suicide and thrust the young changeling into active leadership.\n\nAs a warrior, Argynnis respected the stronger queen's might, and promised her service. In the interim between Vraks's subduing and the invasion of Canterlot in 1002, Argynnis lent her hive's expertise in warfare to further refine and modernize changeling tactics, some of which were put into practice by infiltrator teams in Stalliongrad's Winter Revolution. Yet no matter the reforms, the Heer was not truly ready for Chrysalis's lightning attack on Canterlot, nor the sudden intervention of Princess Cadance and Prince Shining Armor's love overcoming the changeling queen. When Chrysalis came limping back to the changeling lands, Argynnis began to remind her at every turn of her failures, something she rarely ever missed an opportunity to do in the following years.\n\nAlthough one of the major proponents of the Great War, her hive was one of the first major settlements to fall, and she has since been humbled by the Empress. When she made a special request to serve with the Militarium in exchange for more leniency and support for her hive, it was granted. There may be grumblings and murmurings by officers made her subordinates, but they can't fault her for her tactics.

Whenever he wasn't in school or with his parents, he was on the shoreline, merely observing the waves and imagining himself at the helm of an overpowering warship, pulverizing any enemy that would dare cross the path of a defender of Equestria. Unlike ponies his age, he had little fear of deep water, and despite almost drowning himself, managed to rescue a younger filly from the waters around Baltimare shortly before he was sent to the naval academy in Manehattan.\n\nHis tuition entirely paid for by his parents, he at first performed well within the academy. However, his parents soon visited. Then they visited again. And again. And again. Within the first year, they had reaffirmed their expectations and plans for his career two dozen times, and much of his initial fire for the waves was lost.

After arresting the captain and refusing to surrender, he managed to sink one of the pirate ships by ramming it, and focusing all firepower on the second with a broadside of its guns. When word reached home about his bravery, he was promoted to commodore, and left to command a small squadron of ships.

However, he continued to see action, later after the nation was embroiled in war for the first time in hundreds of years.\n\nWhen not sortieing, Scroup pursues a number of passions. Horticulture, raspberries in particular, is a favorite pastime. Additionally, he can be seen scratching down sketches of anything and everything, from plants, to planes, to other ponies. More than a few portraits of his fellow pilots hang on their respective walls as either gifts or art commissions.§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §LScroup§!"

In his training, he constantly questioned some of the tactical decisions of the doctrines that Equestria rigidly adhered to, and received a number of negative citations and punishments for it. They only worsened when, feigning conformity to the standard thought, he would always end up near the top of his compatriots' results due to his sudden shift in orders and battle plans. Although he did graduate, it was only to a role as second lieutenant, where he languished for a number of years while war came to Equestria and lay waste to swathes of his homeland.\n\nOf his own initiative, he formed various prodding squads of ponies, and went around his commanding officer's express permission to both probe defenses, sabotage enemy supply lines, and recon troop positions. When they started turning into all out assaults with few numbers, it was when he was arrested for endangering lives and for contempt of military command. He lay in prison, awaiting court martial, when the Empress ascended and searched for fresh blood to fill the gaps she created.\n\nWhile the Empress sees the benefit of his command, most of his fellow officers do not. Shining Star rarely collaborates, and what he actually submits for his battle plans rarely turn out to be true. He's a loose cannon, but a faithful one, and so long as that cannon is facing the enemy, the Empress has little reason to remove him.§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §LScroup§!"

The middle foal of five, Reckless usually was passed over by her older brothers or her youngest sister, however, that provided her the freedom to explore both her hometown of Ponyville and the surrounding Everfree Forest with far less adult supervision than most fillies her age. More than once, she got into scraps with the wildlife of the Everfree, including one close encounter with a timberwolf that nearly cost her a leg.\n\nAs she grew older, to continue feeding her bottomless wells of energy and to hopefully give her a bit of structure to her life, her parents enrolled her in a cadet program for the Royal Guard for one summer. While there, Reckless learned the basics of war, and after the attack on Canterlot in 1002, a reason for staying on within the cadet program. In 1003, she requested transfer to the standard Armed Forces, and soon labored her way up to the rank of staff sergeant.\n\nWith the outbreak of war in Equestria after a millennium, she has led her squad into battle after battle, almost miraculously coming out alive, with few injuries or casualties.

Unlike many of the other high-ranking officers within the navy, she has had little interest in the sea itself. Before she applied to the Fillydelphian naval college, she was on track to be part of Mareway's weather team, until she was caught in a rogue storm that tracked its way from the Everfree Forest to the region. Despite the attempts of pegasi from across the Meadowlands, the stubborn clouds refused to break, and the city itself was hit by a raging torrent of hail and lightning. In all this, she and other pegasi, weather team or not, fought to keep a semblance of control on the storm. In a sudden updraft, one of her wings was sprained, and she was sent cratering to the earth.\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy, she lost the use of one of her wings, and was forever grounded, envious of her fellow pegasi's luck in keeping their flight. However, she was not stuck forever. The airplane was around the corner, and when aerial combat was adapted to also be from the sea, she took a shining to the idea. While she was older than many of her fellow cadets, she fit in with the culture of Fillydelphia's naval academy, and graduated in a few short years. Through a bit of politicking and maneuvering, she wormed her way into a junior officer role on the ERNS Pegasopolis, the first Equestrian aircraft carrier.\n\nWhen war came to Equestria, she, along with other lieutenants, served aboard the carrier, and she earned a proper command of it after the previous captain was stationed aboard one of the newer carriers. Yet she still served with distinction, and after sinking a number of enemy vessels in port with her complement, she was given command of a full squadron. Although she is not the most innovative commander, she can think quick on her hooves, and her affinity to the sky that most unicorns and earth ponies lack has given her an appreciation for the difficulties of the modern strike force.

However, she did not earn this through application, merit, or friendship with the alicorn, but rather through, as some would say, a rivalry. When Starlight's foalhood friend, Sunburst, earned his cutie mark in magic and left for Celestia's School of Gifted Unicorns, Starlight was left without any other friends in her hometown. Between an obsessively doting father and a friend who never wrote, she sunk slowly into revulsion and hatred over what she saw as the thing that took her life away: cutie marks.\n\nIn 998, Starlight finally made her move, spurred on by the tales of Steel Stallion, Caramel Marks, and her own thoughts around what it truly meant to be equal. Without warning, she left Sire's Hollow for lands unknown, and over time accrued a small following of ponies who were inspired by her rhetoric and determination to see the world become a better, fairer place. In 1000 ALB, shortly before Luna's return, she was granted a small plot of land by Stalliongrad's Supreme Soviet and established an experiment. With her own, personal town, she used her magic to remove her adherents' cutie marks and make everypony truly equal. Except her, since they needed a strong leader.\n\nWhen the Elements exposed her lies in 1003 and she subsequently failed at her revenge she sought dearly because of it, she was offered a chance to redeem herself by Twilight, which she reluctantly took.

Living lives of deceit and misdirection, they were neighbors, friends, and coworkers that never knew about the raging fire that was waiting to be unleashed. Steel Sickle is one of these ponies, a cultist who remained under wraps for her faith in the deity and eternal retribution of Celestia. Both her parents were cultists, as were all her grandparents. The secret of the Sickle name remained safe with her.\n\nOutwardly, Steel was little more than an eccentric, cranky mare who tended to her small plot of crops and occasionally sold them for bits. In private, though, she maintained communication with other members of the cult throughout Equestria. As the time of Daybreaker's ascension grew near, they began to coordinate and plan for if Celestia realized her potential. She, and others, were in Canterlot when Celestia awoke to her duty. When Daybreaker proclaimed her godhood, she was one of the first to unveil her hidden life, and pledge undying allegiance to the God-Empress.\n\nDespite most inquisitors being unicorns, Steel has been rewarded for her years of faithful duty in Ponyville.

Neither of his grandparents continued on to join the Royal Guard, despite his grandfather earning a medal for his own heroics, but the influence of such deeds affected the course of Stormchaser's life drastically.\n\nWhen he was old enough, he applied for military school, and was soon off to Canterlot to study what it meant to lead troops and make difficult decisions in the heat of battle. His tenure there coincided with the changeling invasion of Canterlot, and as a young officer cadet, he assisted in the defense of one of the hospitals in the city. When his commanding officer was wounded and unable to lead, he wrested charge from the second, who was unable to handle the pressure of the role, and kept hold of the hospital for the entire fight.\n\nAfter earning two medals for his bravery and leadership, he was instantly graduated to the rank of lieutenant, and earned additional commendations in the future battles that plagued Equestria.

A few murmur that she is corrupted and twisted by Daybreaker's torture, but they would be wrong. The Empress has only shown Sunrise the light of truth. An awakening. Revealing her perfect self.\n\nFrom her very first days in the Empress's school for gifted unicorns, Sunrise was different. She was special. Where other foals barely could accomplish basic thaumaturgy, she had already devised transmutation and advanced evocation spells that could put to shame some instructors. Since her ascension to alicornhood, that might has only increased, burgeoned by the Empress's encouragement and words of wisdom. Even before she was awakened to the truth of Order and the plight of Harmony, the Lady Inquisitor was hesitant to fight in open conflict. Better it was to solve the conflict through research and magical superiority than bashing heads together. Yet she has been convinced of the need to lead, much like her co-equal, Dawnbreak Shimmer.\n\nWhile Sunrise Sparkle has little combat experience, she makes up for it in her ability to learn, analyze, and study any mistakes that she may make. The Empress has clarified that her soldiers are her responsibility, but what she chooses to do with them is entirely up to her.

Was it too much to ask that everypony bow to Princess Celestia and give her the due worship she deserved?

She, as she always told her mother, had friends everywhere.\n\nWhen the Royal Guard expanded its roster into other divisions, her father enlisted for the artillery corpse and was brought back to Canterlot, to further his knowledge of mechanical equipment and maintenance. While the pay was still low, it was more than the entire family made in Severyana, and with it he rented a small apartment, and Swift and her siblings moved with him.

The nature and the status of her crimes have never been made public, although before she was placed in the penal squadron, she was part of the Equestrian air force, which was the only reason she was not yet sent to her homeland in New Mareland for trial. During the short-lived conflict with the changelings, she led her disarmed and toothless planes in daring dives and ostentatious maneuvers that drew the fire of both troops on the ground and pilots in the air. From there she was again put on ice until war returned to Equestria, and she was given command of a number of other convicts to perform suicide missions.\n\nDespite it all, she came out alive, and with higher kill counts than the rest of the Wonderbolts combined. Eventually, whatever charges against her were rescinded, as she proved loyal to her country, and she continued flying against the enemies of Harmony and racking up kill after kill. Fellow pilots describe her as a single, giant pegasus, as it is like her plane is an extension of herself.\n\nShe has since been given a commission in army command, and has been stationed in New Mareland. While she would rather be in the air, the fact she has been commended by Daybreaker herself has impressed the gravity of the request. She's a sharp mind and flexible, jocular mindset, which has enamored those under her command, even if a few grumble about having to work under a criminal. In her spare time, she tends to tinker with her plane, and can frequently be seen covered in oil and grease after a long day working on it.§!"

  #blueblood_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! §L1st of June, 974 ALB in Canterlot§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §LPrince Blueblood is one of the few privileged in Canterlot who can claim a familial relationship with Princess Celestia, although it certainly was not by her choice. Around a century prior to his birth, Blueblood's great-grandmother, Silk Stocking, was adopted by Princess Celestia for her charity work, friendship, and like-minded attitude. Additionally, his ancestor was there for the Princess at one of her lowest lows on the nine hundredth anniversary of Luna's banishment. This memory of Celestia's close friend was one of the only reasons that she deigned on the young Blueblood the title of Prince of Equestria, for he certainly did not reflect her.\n\nFrom his youth, he frequently bragged about his unique status as a nephew – albeit an adoptive one – of Celestia and how he "had her ear" on any issue that arose, especially if they were relevant to him. As he was almost the same age as Celestia's student, Sunset Shimmer, it was not uncommon to see him torment her or other staff of the castle. In time, though, his outward maliciousness faded and he merely became bored by the doldrums of having everything he wanted. In time, after Sunset's disappearance, he entertained himself with suitors, whom he would routinely either turn down, or court for perhaps a week or two and promise them the world before ending the relationship. These proclivities eventually morphed into toying with every mare who latched onto him by dismissing them as gold diggers, hosting raucous parties to never attend, or starting ridiculous trends in the Canterlot fashion scene to see if they would catch on.\n\nHowever, after the Grand Galloping Gala in 1001, where he was humiliated by Rarity for his behavior, he began to re-evaluate his priorities. With the failed invasion by Chrysalis in 1002, his ennui gave him a stroke of inspiration. Through ancient laws that were never written away, he purchased himself a commission and quickly rose to the rank of Field Marshal of Equestria. Although the talk of Canterlot was that he'd soon grow tired of the rigors of military life, as the highest officer in the land after Shining Armor's departure to the Crystal Empire, he rarely visited the field. His instructional time was far less than most, but he has taken to time outside of his duties to studying war. Still, he's nothing but a colt playing with toy soldiers, and field experience is the far greater teacher. His underlings have protested of his harsh treatment, but at the moment, Princess Celestia has seen fit to continue his commission. Somewhere, she claims, there will be a moment where he'll become a true stallion. Whether that gets thousands of ponies killed remains to be seen.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

As she is quiet, she doesn't speak much about her life growing up in Cloudsdale, other than it was frequently terrifying, frightening, or mortifying. One of her only solaces from the torments of school and the frustration at home with her younger brother, Zephyr Breeze, was her friend Rainbow Dash. However, that friendship still sometimes brought her into the line of social fire, as it were, since Rainbow commonly butted heads with schoolyard bullies and thereby made her a tangential target at inopportune times for her. Otherwise known as every time.\n\nTo her parents, it appeared that she'd never find her special talent, given how meek and fearful a soul she was. While they were not oft to stand up for themselves either, Fluttershy had seemed to inherit both of their passive natures. However, that began to change when Rainbow Dash performed a sonic rainboom while racing her schoolyard rivals in a competition she was dared into during flight camp, which accidentally knocked Fluttershy to the ground far below. As she was saved by a flock of butterflies, she soon discovered her reciprocated love of animals, to the point she understood them as if talking with ponies.\n\nIn the ensuing years, she moved to Ponyville, the site of where she first discovered her special talent, and became a friend to all the woodland creatures of the area. Her later friendship with Twilight Sparkle pushed her far beyond her boundaries, and that bond she had developed in her a strong, kind, but firm assertiveness when necessary. To that end, it rocked the news world when Fluttershy applied for the head researcher position of the megaspell project. Although she intends it for only healing purposes, her colleagues already have other... aggressive intentions for such magic and may prove to be too overwhelming for her, despite her hidden steadfastness.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

Growing up on the Pie family's Rock Farm, she took on the brunt of the work before her younger sisters did, which formed much of her hard-working, grouchy demeanor. Since the Pies focused much of their early attention upon her, she did receive the majority of the family ethic, and is a rather ascetic, if grumpy individual.\n\nAlthough at one point Limestone did wish to leave the Rock Farm to study in rocks like her younger sister Maud, her parents convinced her to stay at the farm after Pinkie left to live her own life. The already choleric Limestone grew more irritable and determined after Pinkie departed, on a train to nowhere that eventually ended up in Ponyville. While she doesn't blame her sister for anything, and in fact loves Pinkie as deeply as she does the rest of her family, Limestone does see herself as the one who must guard her family's way of life and preserve the farm for future generations. If asked about what she would be protecting it from, she wouldn't or couldn't give an answer, but she shields it just the same.\n\nCompared to Pinkie Pie, Maud is abrasive and aggressive, as well as commanding and bossy. Whether the years of expectations from her parents ground upon her or she simply would have always ended up a grouch is up to speculation, but few in Rockville worry about haggling or arguing with her, since she frequently gets her way. However, to her family, she is still harsh, but does so out of a care for their safety. With war on the horizon, she has convinced her parents to at last let her go, so that she can serve with the military and protect her home. Her work ethic has already helped her climb through our ranks, and her pushy, berating mindset would be a perfect addition to help hone our infantry's training for being under pressure.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

Elder sister to Pinkie Pie, Maud is a stark contrast to her younger sibling's bubbly personality. Even when she was a young foal, she rarely showed the same range of emotion as any of her other siblings, instead focusing on the rocks that were harvested and their mineral compositions with an almost laser-like focus.\n\nWhile she was still a filly, Maud's interest in rocks, geology, and tectonics paid off when she successfully convinced her parents to shift Holder's Boulder, a piece of family history, exactly seven point six inches to the right of its previous location. To quote her, they took its resting spot for granite. Within a few days, there was a downpour, which eroded some of the last supporting dirt of an old portion of the overhang, and Holder's Boulder was saved from destruction. As she grew older, she left for Rockville proper, where she studied in its premier geology university and earned herself what the ponies there call a rocktorate in rock science.\n\nMany ponies find Maud rather unnerving, as although ponies who live in Rockville and the surrounding rock farms are frequently serious, Maud simply doesn't emote. To everypony she meets, she speaks in a dry, monotone cantor, which makes many question whether she has a shred of empathy in her body. However, they simply have never cracked her shell, as she is extremely protective of both her family and friends.\n\nDue to her rocktorate, she is extremely knowledgeable of the earth, and can find weak points that can shave hours or days off of trench or fortification building.

However, her beginnings are as humble as the average pony, although she received much adoration and encouragement from her parents. Said parents are still her biggest fans.\n\nWhen she was a filly, she already began to show predilections for standing by her friends, as she stood up for her oldest companion, Fluttershy, throughout their shared years in school. Every flying competition she could enter she did, which soon earned her a reputation of both an excellent flier, but also a braggart, as the number of trophies she had continued to climb.

Rather, she was born to two simple unicorns, and while she loves her parents dearly, their bombastic and loud-mouthed personalities frequently clashed with her thoughtful and ambitious one fiercely. Still, despite her interests in fashion being seen as "wasted bits," she eventually earned her cutie mark in fashion, after a sonic rainboom cracked open a geode containing hundreds of gems, to which her magic led her moments prior. One of her signature flourishes in her designs is embedding at least one or two gemstones into every piece, as, according to her, it brings out the best in anypony's appearance and ties up the whole image.\n\nTo this day, her first boutique, and the one she directly runs, is located in Ponyville, despite her chain now having stores in both Manehattan and Canterlot. While some of her close friends tease her as being prissy or fussy, she considers herself cultured, but that doesn't mean she won't go against her preferences for the sake of others. Tied in with her image as a fashion designer, she is also known as a philanthropist, and will happily give away her expensive dresses to those who can't afford them, which is a policy that both Sassy Saddles and Coco Pommel in Canterlot and Manehattan respectively carry out.\n\nWhen approached, she happily agreed to volunteer her time for Equestria's greater good, especially since she could "fix those horridly outmoded uniforms" which the military still uses.§!\n\n§YPortarit by:§! §LScroup§!"

As the oldest living member of the extensive and Equestria-spanning Apple family, she has experienced much change but still sees how much stays the same. As she was born during the middle of Equestria's industrial revolution, she saw the transition from a general agrarian base to a thriving economy of various refined goods.\n\nFor the first dozen or so years of her life, she lived on the road with her family, traveling from region to region gathering seeds and working as hired hooves between botany sales. In time, they earned appreciation and recognition by the Crown, and were granted a section of land near the Everfree Forest, which became the founding site of Ponyville. A number of other families soon moved when the first harvests planted by the Apples proved ripe and bountiful, and the small village became a proper town in only a generation.\n\nAs a mother, she was stern but caring to her son, Bright Mac, and although the Apples carried a fierce rivalry with another group of farmers, the Pears, she accepted Bright's wife Pear Butter after she was disowned by her parents after marrying. Later in life, she effectively retired to be a homebody, and looked after her grandfoals while Bright and Pear tended to the farm.

Fizzlepop Berrytwist, formerly known as Tempest Shadow, was one of those ponies. One of her most defining features, her jagged and broken horn, was not always a part of her. Growing up in Shire, she was simply another unicorn filly who had friends, dreams, and aspirations. While she was not the most powerful unicorn, she still was dexterous with her magic and was on track to being able to apply to Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. In a freak accident after going into a cave to find a ball she and her two friends, Spring Rain and Glitter Drops, her horn was destroyed by an enraged Ursa Minor. Only through her two friends' quick thinking and reaction did she survive at all.\n\nYet fate was not kind to Fizzlepop, as her friends found it difficult to be around her, and her depression at no longer attaining her dream sunk deeper. Ultimately, feeling abandoned by her friends and maligned by society at large, she simply left Shire one day, never to return. With no plan and only a few bits in her pocket to pay for travel and food, she stowed away on a ship to Zebrica, where she lived for years scraping by and fighting amongst the destitute rabble there, until she stumbled into the Storm King's ravaging army on its early conquests. With her hardened and bitter demeanor and with a wit that tricked his soldiers to get a chance at him directly, she impressed him enough that he offered her a "once in a lifetime opportunity" as his second-in-command, recently made vacant. She agreed, on the condition that he restore her horn when he had gained the magical power to do so, which was his final goal for his conquests.\n\nAs the Storm King was ravaging country after country on Zebrica, word reached Equestria of him and Celestia sent Twilight and her friends to convince an old peer of Celestia's, Queen Novo of Hippogriffia, to aid them in an assault on his forces and to end his tsunami of terror. Despite some faux pas, the Element Bearers convinced her, and in the ensuing battle of Ain Trogourait, Twilight was captured by Fizzlepop in the chaos of the fight. While it still raged, she brought Twilight to the Storm King, as he could sap her power with an artifact she acquired for him, the Staff of Sacanas. However, after draining Twilight, and with the power of the weather at his claws, he refused to aid Fizzlepop. With her eyes opened, she dueled with him, and was barely saved by Twilight, who intervened and distracted him enough for Tempest to use one of his petrification orbs on him.\n\nAlthough she still feels like an outcast, she has returned to Equestria with Twilight, and is slowly reintegrating into Equestrian life. Her guilt for her actions weighs heavily on her, and she has taken to traveling the land to aid any who need it.

As a local to one of the friendliest and most open towns in Equestria, she is caring and warm to everypony who ends up under her care, but the amicable demeanor only serves her skills as a nurse.\n\nUnder Doctor Horse, she has cared for patients from all walks of life, and seen them all recover to full health – or as much as could be expected – in short order. Although she originally trained to be a doctor herself, when she graduated from Summerdale's medical college, it was in the middle of a slump for medical care, and she could only find employment as an RN. While overqualified, her innate compassion for the suffering of other creatures has made her a popular pony within Ponyville General.\n\nAfter the call went out for capable ponies to assist the reorganized and vitalized Equestrian Armed Forces, Redheart volunteered to assist in whatever way she could. As part of the medical lead team, she visits the front lines and sees to the state of field hospitals and medical care there. Some of her chipper personality has been muted since this change, but much of the Redheart that Ponyville loved is still there, under a more serious and determined exterior. So long as she is watching them, they'll never be without a guardian angel.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LReddthebat§!"

From a young age, she dreamed of one day striking it big in the fashion industry, which at the time of her formative years, was burgeoning in Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Las Pegasus, and Canterlot itself. Although her family was not wealthy, they could afford to provide for her to attend the premier business and fashion school in Manehattan, which she attended as soon as she was old enough.\n\nWhile at the school, she further refined her special talent for organization and craftsmareship, and ended up near the head of her class. As part of her final semester, she was required to work within the fashion industry in Manehattan, and after weeks searching, was approved to be the assistant of Suri Polomare, a recent designer who was making waves in the fashion world for her up and coming, chic styles.\n\nHowever, shortly after becoming Suri's assistant, she was tasked with making her employer's dresses, rather than the seamstress herself. Soon, the plagiarism that was rampant in Suri's dresses were evident, but her protests were ignored at the school, as "just a part of design iteration." Only when Rarity attended the Manehattan Fashion Week and displayed true generosity did Coco wake from her grind-induced mental fog and quit her placement, and her degree altogether.\n\nShe has now worked at Rarity's Manehattan boutique, "Rarity for You," for three years, her business acumen has become quite apparent. Although she is quiet and reserved, she also loves Equestria and the opportunity it brings, and if asked, would gladly assist with some of our economic reorganization.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

As one of the landed elite, he is a part of the aristocracy that comprises the privy council of Princess Celestia, and frequently makes the voices of the castle, Canterlot, and Equestria known to the Princess. Although his noble house is not the the most influential, his upbringing within the halls of the castle allowed him to grow close with Princess Celestia, at least as much as she allowed anypony in decades past.\n\nFancy speaks little of his younger years, as he considers it unimportant to his jobs at hoof or the pony he is, but older servants within Canterlot Castle speak of times when he would attempt to watch Celestia during her day court or otherwise stay close to the Princess. Like aristocracy, his education was immaculate and he was raised to be a true gentlecolt, even if others of his class forget the lessons much more readily.\n\nThrough his wise council, he successfully helped to navigate some of the latter crises of Equestria, as he helped to keep the populace calm in Nightmare Moon's return, and suggested the non-violent approach to the uprising by Stalliongrad. As recognition for his service, he was granted the role of Privy Council Chairpony, and wields more power than his fellow upper crust. However, this has not gone to his head, and he ensures that his responsibilities happen quickly, but fairly to those beneath him.\n\nThrough the years, there were always rumors of the love life he led, and currently the buzz is that he is in a relationship with the famed Prench supermodel, Fleur de Lis. With every interview, he promises that they're only platonic friends, and that even if were to be in a romantic relationship, his duty to Equestria and Harmony comes first and always will.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §Lkp-shadowsquirrel§!"

Born into the prestigious Rich family, his upbringing was without difficulty or hardship, as by the time he was old enough to do work, his family had already become the most prominent in the region, thanks to the monopoly they acquired from the Apples to sell zap-apple jam. Said jam is only produced by them.\n\nSince he had little want, most of his colthood was spent learning from his father, Stinkin' Rich, how to run the family business and to negotiate good, but fair deals for both parties involved. Although he had more money than he knew what to do with, he still took time to spend with those who were less fortunate than him, and had a number of friends within the lower and middle classes of Ponyville.\n\nWhen his father retired, he used much of his money to expand his business operations, and although the zap-apple jam production has stayed limited and primarily focused in Ponyville and the immediate regions, Filthy Rich's Barnyard Brokery can be seen across Equestria. Usually they're packed with customers during the one short week that zap-apple jam can be bought, but are busy throughout the year.\n\nSpeculation around his constant work ethic is sometimes the talk of Ponyville, given that he rarely spends much time at home with his wife, Spoiled Rich, or his daughter, Diamond Tiara. However, this workaholic attitude has driven him to success, and he's always eager to broker new deals with ponies. Despite the rest of his family's sour demeanor, he defies the trend of greedy capitalists, and frequently donates to charity and, in general, is seen as a kind and amicable pony.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LRiley Vinchers§!"

From her parents and teachers, the radio and newspapers, the changeling menace was always something that was in the back of her, and many of her generation's minds. Although there never was a changeling infiltration like some ponies in Vanhoover feared, the backdrop of the threat shaped many of her early interests in military strategy. When Queen Chrysalis almost toppled the Equestrian government in 1002, it only further pushed the teen Arcane Nova to apply for every military academy that would potentially take her.\n\nAn appreciation for war in pre-dawn Equestria was looked upon as strange or frightening, but after acceptance into the class of 1005 to Fillydelphia Military Academy, her talent for analyzing combat situations and adapting to unexpected developments became apparent. When she set a new record for holding out in a scenario designed to be an impossible defense, she was transferred to Canterlot's academy to further refine her aptitude to war and war-related magic.\n\nIn the ensuing restructuring of the military after Daybreaker's ascension, her unwavering dedication to guarding Equestria and her astute observations earned her a position within the military science wing of the Solar Empire, where she faithfully serves the Empress. Despite her young age, she is a highly effective tactician, and since her appointment, she has striven with other theorists at rewriting the Solar Empire's code of war.

In the time of Flash, his ancestor served on a team of chosen fliers to prevent a meteorological disaster from striking some deer settlements along the shores of later Equestrian territory. Said crisis was caused by a failure in the weather weaver of Cloudsdale, which sent a large storm, filled to the brim with hailstones and tornadoes, toward the deer shores in the north. When they arrived, the deer forbade them from assisting, as they tried in vain to use their own magic to stop the tempest.\n\nWhile Grimhoof, first of his name, initially obeyed the orders of the Royal Legion's commander, Ironhead, when Flash Magnus went on through and assisted the ailing deer, he and the other members followed. The modern Grimhoof is just as serious and dedicated as his ancestor, but has not had the chance to prove himself like in ancient times.\n\nAs he received his training in Cloudsdale's Royal Military Academy, he is part of the Cloudsdale Royal Guard and is one of the commanding officers there. His study of early pegasus history, like Commander Hurricane, has inspired his military theory of hard-hitting, aggressive assaults. Although this has put him in conflict in the past with the Equestrian military at large, as it has helped keep the area of Cloudsdale clear of any dangers like manticores or ursa minors, it has not been seen as a detriment.

In times past, he and his fellow Pillars were idolized as mythical champions who battled monsters, saved towns and villages, and kept the heartbeat of Harmony alive from the ever-present threat of evil wishing to smother its flame. Unlike most folk tales and fables, the majority of them are true, as he, along with Star Swirl the Bearded and the other Pillars, helped Princesses Celestia and Luna keep the young realm of Equestria safe and secure.\n\nAs he often likes to espouse, he was but a wee lad for many years, scrawny and weak, and frequently the laughingstock of his village, which sat at the base of one of the many volcanic islands in the Spa Islands chain. While he was allowed to associate with the Mighty Helm, the village's elite guard, he was given menial tasks, such as digging trenches. However, that mockery turned into his village's salvation when the volcano erupted, and the villagers refused to leave their one and only home. In a fit of desperation and care for his friends and family, he began to dig, dig, and dig. Through the extreme exertion and channeling of earth pony magic, his body transformed into the large, muscular pony he is today, and his village was rescued.\n\nAfter word of his deed reached Star Swirl, the mage befriended and recruited him to help guard Equestria. When all the Pillars returned from their time in Limbo, Rockhoof found it the most challenging of his peers to adapt to the modern world. He was a warrior, but Equestria was now at peace. However, due to his skill of stories and desire to keep the memory of his old friends and family alive, he has been made the official Keeper of Tales of Equestria by Princess Twilight, and now with war ahoof, he has eagerly requested to join in active duty to aid Equestria's defense once again.§!"

While most legends about historical figures end up being stretched to the point of absurdity, the majority of those told of Flash's life before being stranded in Limbo are truthful, with only mild deviation from reality. Flash has yet to comment on which ones are accurate and which are not.\n\nLike most young stallions in Cloudsdale in early Equestria, Flash was trained in combat and warfare during his formative years. At that time, Cloudsdale was tasked with guarding both the Princesses' lives as well as protecting the outer fringes of the nation, which was much smaller before Luna's banishment. He speaks little of his infancy, but speaks freely when asked of his time in the Cloudsdale Royal Legion, which eventually morphed into the Wonderbolts hundreds of years later. While he was still a cadet, he, his squad, and his commanding officer, Ironhead, were on a routine patrol through the southern edge of Equestria, over part of the Badlands. When his squad was attacked and captured by several dragons, he was the only survivor willing to go after them, and after convincing Ironhead of his plan of distraction, was gifted the fire-proof shield, Netitus.\n\nHis cunning idea succeeded, and he was rewarded with keeping the shield. Eventually, Star Swirl the Bearded met with him and offered him a place in protecting Equestria as a whole from even greater threats. When he and the other Pillars returned from Limbo, he returned to active duty, as he claimed he had many years left of service he could give to Equestria.

Growing up in a home of staunch monarchists, Copper Top's foalhood was filled with praise and adoration for Princess Celestia and the great work she did keeping Equestria running. Yet it wasn't just her, as there were thousands of ponies who kept the peace and made sure everypony was safe. With these tales in her head, Copper Top eventually applied to the military academy in Canterlot, with the hope that a decent, if not stellar, student that she was would be accepted and taught how to keep Equestria safe.\n\nHowever, she didn't make the cut, and instead of achieving her dream of a general of justice, she had to settle for a simple constable instead. Her other option of the Manehattan Police College welcomed her with open arms, and in it she learned much of the inner-workings of keeping ponies safe. Crime might have been low, but it wasn't nonexistent.\n\nAfter graduation, she quickly earned a spot as a deputy of the Manehattan Police Department, where she was mostly given to menial tasks veteran officers didn't take. However,  as a deputy, she gained a reputation of acting first on assignments, going by what her gut told her. Sometimes she'd succeed, sometimes she didn't, yet she did complete enough cases successfully that she was promoted to a full officer, and given her own partner to work cases with.\n\nAs a duo, the two would continue to crack mysteries and make various arrests, all with a rapid, shoot-from-the-hip approach.

Many ponies have commented on her more than passing resemblance to Spitfire, but few realize how close to the target they actually are. When Blaze was but a young filly, her older sister, Spitfire, began her training and eventual career in the Wonderbolts, setting a high bar for the rest of her family. For the remainder of her foalhood, until she was old enough to pursue the same path.\n\nAlthough she succeeded in joining the elite flight group in 997 ALB, she never once achieved any new records, nor did she overcome her elder sister's personal bests. Where most siblings would develop some level of envy of their more successful kin, Blaze never did. By the time she graduated, Spitfire was already captain of the Wonderbolts, and while she was given no leniency, did earn a spot in the active roster with Spitfire.\n\nHowever, she was never as enamored with the Wonderbolts as Spitfire nor many of its other members. Her pride in her accomplishments were enough, but they were separate, outside of the increasingly civilian and complacent Wonderbolts. Safety might have been improved, at Spitfire's behest, but preparedness for war was at an all-time, something she warned about time and again.\n\nIn the wake of the changeling attack in 1002, Blaze began to take a more active role in the fledgling Equestrian Airforce, overseeing the design of the Halifax and later Lancaster bombers. While she has earned few medals, her own flying style of aggressive, unwavering dives mimics the bombers that she has had hooves in creating.

For the first year, they merely protected her from any dangers to her life, left in the wake of Nightmare Moon's banishment, for while the war was over, Nightmarists still dwelt within Equestria, and sought to usher in Nightmare Moon's plans for eternal night.\n\nOn the eve of the first anniversary of Nightmare Moon's defeat, the leader of the E.U.P., Firefly, organized a performance for Princess Celestia, both as a commemoration of her victory, and as a distraction from the emotions that were raging within her for the actions she took. Although all three races partook in the festivities, it was the pegasi who surpassed them all, with their innate weather magic mingling with the spells of the unicorns in the guard, generating an eye-dazzling display of lightning that stunned all who saw it. It was in that moment that the Wonderbolts were formed from the later reorganization that Firefly undertook in the aftermath. In only a couple of years, the E.U.P. dropped first the E, and ultimately the U, as the pegasi became the dominant group within the force.\n\nOver the centuries, and under command of ponies like Easyglider, Fairweather, and Flair d'Mare, the original mission of the Wonderbolts morphed and transformed as the risk of Nightmarist attack dwindled to nothing. Although they maintained an active military presence, they remained a primarily civilian-focused establishment until Purple Dart focused them entirely upon their original purpose in the wake of changeling skirmishes in the early 900s. Only recently was this reversed under Spitfire's tenure as leader of the Wonderbolts.\n\nRegardless of their purpose, the Wonderbolts have created more aces, if only in theory, than any other airforce on Equus or Griffonia, and the continued predominance of their academy will ensure that an Equestrian pilot will always soar above the rest.§!"

However, he has only uncommonly interacted with Princess Celestia.\n\nWhere Raven focuses on itineraries and ensuring that the calendar runs smoothly for the Crown, Dotted Line instead takes a back seat, where he can more thoroughly scour the underbellies of the government and audit it so that it may be kept transparent. Through his tenure of the last fifteen years, his position created by the Princess for such a purpose, he has uncovered a number of embezzlement schemes and areas that can be streamlined or improved for better function of the government. Although dry and dour, he has quipped before that where Raven is the smiling, happy face of Celestia's day, he's the equivalent of the bright moonlight of Luna: ponies feel safe to do their dirty work, but it is still visible for those who look.\n\nDespite his infrequent interaction with Princess Celestia, he still knows her better than most, and whenever he is consulted by her, he tends to provide insight that few others have.

While clothed in the same armor as Primaris and every other legion, they rely less on their magical weapons and more on their innate magic, and can be identified by their pure white plating with orange flares. Blueblood has been offered by Bunsen Beaker and Pinpoint to undergo the process of becoming a Praetorian in order to lead the Dawn Angels, but he has so far steadfastly refused, citing the danger and the potential loss of identity in the creation process.§!"

Part of the process of becoming Praetorians affects pegasi somewhat differently, which causes many subjects to lose what inhibitions they may have had in battle.

Primaris is frequently tasked with protecting the Empress herself, and the Dawn Angels and Blood Ravens have their tactical advantages.

  EQS_agitated_workers_desc:0 "The claws of the Harmonic Resistance have sliced through our average working pony, corrupting their minds to believe that we mean them harm.

  EQS_anti_order_propaganda_desc:0 "Overnight, posters decrying the Empress and her policies have sprung up along billboards, buildings, and alleys.

  SOL_harmonic_resistance_idea_desc:0 "Despite all that the Empress has done, despite how much she has already lost to preserve Harmony and Order, many ponies still resist the Empire. Although they are too few to openly rebel, they still dissuade, terrorize, and disrupt. Rooting them out will take much time, all the while, their lies must be countered. If we are distracted through war, then their destabilizing influence my only grow."

  eqs_order_idea1_desc:0 "Harmony has changed. It has adapted to the modern world. Instead of complete freedom, there must be limits. Ponies must work for the greater good of Harmony itself, they must accept where they are told to go and where they must live. If Daybreaker tells them to toil, they will toil. If she tells them to die for their country, they will die. Campaigns and correct messaging will achieve this unity."

  SOL_frequent_cost_cutting:0 "Frequent "Cost Cutting""
  SOL_frequent_cost_cutting_desc:0 "Within deep recesses of government, heresy can always grow and fester. Despite living so close to divinity, ponies can still lose their way, but that is the reason the Inquisitionis guards Harmony.

  SOL_sacrificial_work:0 "Sacrificial Work"
  SOL_sacrificial_work_desc:0 "No able-bodied pony who is not serving on the front lines shall go without work. Feed the factories, protect Harmony.

  SOL_heretic_cannon_fodder:0 "Useful Heretic Applications"
  SOL_heretic_cannon_fodder_desc:0 "Rather than expend energy and resources with holding heretics, we must utilize them for that which they are skilled.

  SOL_traditional_sacrifice:0 "Traditions of Sacrifice"
  SOL_traditional_sacrifice_desc:0 "From birth, our ponies must learn their blessings are only from the God-Empress.

Teachings from the Adoratio on tithes and willing gifts shall prepare our ponies for times of strife in war."
  SOL_religious_government:0 "Religious Government"
  SOL_religious_government_desc:0 "Separation was a grave error. Corruption can fester when a government has no backbone to which it can be tied or a framework to which it can be fastened.

  ###Fallen Hero###
  SOL_mandatory_law_passing:0 "Mandatory Law Creation"
  SOL_mandatory_law_passing_desc:0 "Inaction and fillibustering only drags out necessary reforms of the old regime. Every politician must prove their merit and devotion to the protection of Harmony.

  SOL_defence_of_empire_act_idea_desc:0 "The Empire lives and dies on its ability to protect itself. As the Empress cannot be everywhere at once, she cannot hope to achive this defense by herself. Going forward, the Imperial Military will have leeway to make its own decisions without direct, Imperial approval.

  SOL_noponys_equal:0 "Nopony's Equal"
  SOL_noponys_equal_desc:0 "The Empress is as hard-working as the rest of the government, but she needs space.

  SOL_balancing_cabinet:0 "A Balancing Cabinet"
  SOL_balancing_cabinet_desc:0 "Our Empress is expert in many things, but she is not omniscient.

  SOL_legion_of_labor_idea_desc:0 "Utilizing the dregs and destitute of society gives them purpose and a method of cheap labor for the improvement of the Empire.

  SOL_showcased_element_bearers:0 "Bearers of Order"
  SOL_showcased_element_bearers_desc:0 "No more is Harmony split by factionalism.

Their exploits and heroism have proven to be inspirations to us all, and they will further the Empress's vision in their service."
  SOL_the_true_elements:0 "The True Elements of Harmony"
  SOL_the_true_elements_desc:0 "Magical macguffins are no substitute for the Empress herself. While she can bear the burden of Harmony and its Elements directly, we must look to her instead of old ways and antiquated ideas to protect the Empire. We may rally around the symbols of the past, but they are nothing compared to the work of the Empress today."
  SOL_overpowering_government:0 "Overpowering Government"
  SOL_overpowering_government_desc:0 "Delegating many responsibilities to lesser ponies is a risk, but the Empress has cleared all of those whom she trusts to carry out her will. These dignitaries will be treated just the same as if she were speaking herself. When the Empress is not available for comment or decree, they will carry her full weight instead."
  SOL_impossible_asks:0 "Impossible Asks"
  SOL_impossible_asks_desc:0 "Already much has been given in the defense of Harmony, but there are always more risks and dangers upon the horizon. Campaigns of the atrocities that lie beyond our border will be run to motivate more to serve in the Imperial Military. Every true-blooded Imperial citizen must be ready to bleed and die for Harmony's survival."
  SOL_magical_mastery:0 "Magical Mastery"
  SOL_magical_mastery_desc:0 "Magic is the heart of Harmony. Mysteries abound in what can still be done that we have not determined, but we have already learned much and used it in miniature applications. Through study, our matrices are becoming more and more like a pony's magic signature each day and capable of much more destruction and power than previous iterations.."
  SOL_required_tattling:0 "Required Tattling"
  SOL_required_tattling_desc:0 "The best way to find out something is wrong in society is having loyal citizens inform authorities.

  SOL_subdued_will:0 "Subdued Wills"
  SOL_subdued_will_desc:0 "Complete freedom is a lie. To live in autonomy is to serve oneself and to harm the goals of Harmony and Order. Although ponies have come to accept the Empress, they still are hesitant with some of her requests. Further reminders of their weakness compared to her will slowly whittle down this resistance, and they will obey and follow her where needed."
  SOL_celestial_free_will:0 "Freedom of Will"
  SOL_celestial_free_will_desc:0 "To force ponies to love and obey is to not earn their admiration and trust at all. While there is risk, they must be allowed to choose the path they wish to take in life. Order, while important, will take a back seat to Harmony. They have already been instructed in what is best, now they must live it."
  SOL_unneeded_help:0 "Unneeded Help"
  SOL_unneeded_help_desc:0 "For ponies to not leech off society, there must be rules. Rules must be followed. The Empress provides enough for all, but they must do what they can to earn it. Helping others, through volunteer work or actively searching for jobs will prove that a pony is not a burden upon society. If they are at their rope's end, then they will be saved. Survival is for the most competent."
  SOL_Protect_the_Weak_idea:0 "Solar Corporatism"
  #SOL_Protect_the_Weak_idea_desc:0 "The ponies must be provided for - nopony should be left to live in poverty. That is, if they are loyal subjects of the Empress."
  SOL_Protect_the_Weak_idea_desc:0 "Everypony must be cared for, especially the most vulnerable and sickly among us. Harmony is not a cruel mistress, and nopony will be left by the wayside, so long as they prove their worth as best they can. And, that is, if they are loyal subjects of the Empress."

  SOL_Lux_et_Tenebris_idea1_desc:0 "Old ideas and concepts have proven incorrect with the new regime. Ponies' minds are simply too small to understand the dangers that fully surround them, but that doesn't mean that our instructors cannot try and present the gravity of reality and the threat Harmony is in."
  SOL_daybreakers_knowledge:0 "Knowledge of the Empress"
  SOL_daybreakers_knowledge_desc:0 "To see as Daybreaker sees is the beginning of wisdom. Harmony is greater than just a single pony, and all citizens are sacrifice to preserve it.

  ###Conquest###
  SOL_all_ponies:0 "Pan-Ponyism"
  SOL_all_ponies_desc:0 "Ponies are united by blood, and no matter their distance, they are all the Empress's. While there has been some level of understanding of this shared path before, more must comprehend that it is their destiny to be ruled over by the Empress. Everypony will become one with [ROOT.GetNameDef], as it is only natural for the Empress to rule them."
  SOL_changeling_solarists:0 "Solarizing the Changelings"
  SOL_changeling_solarists_desc:0 "While changelings can never hope to be accepted for all the atrocities they've committed and would have committed if the Empress didn't stop them, they can still prove useful. As their hives have hundreds of thousands of warm bodies, it is best if they be put to use, and if a few perish in the process, what concern of is it of ours?"
  SOL_united_queens:0 "Buggy Quartet"
  SOL_united_queens_desc:0 "Chrysalis was always the problem, although her closest allies certainly are no saints. However, the four major hives have pledged their support to the Empress, and their knowledge and help on the changeling lands have been invaluable. It is even applicable to our own nation, as well."
  SOL_solar_vikings:0 "Solarist Shipwrights"
  SOL_solar_vikings_desc:0 "Deer have been sailing the seas for as long as they've had a coastline. With generations of knowledge far more than ours, they have no doubt developed tricks that we have not, and requiring their shipwrights to work for us will lead to better quality ships in the end."
  SOL_imperial_resort:0 "Resort of the Sun"
  SOL_imperial_resort_desc:0 "Puerto Caballo is in the perfect spot for vacationers the world over, and was popular before its unrest led to distrust with the government and its ability to keep tourists safe.

  SOL_smashed_yaks_desc:0 "Although hardy and stubborn, yaks are not unbreakable. Through slowly whittling down their cultural barbarism, we can reforge them into a useful worker class, who can go into any dangerous situation and probably come back out unscathed instead of relying on a pony."
  SOL_imperial_corrections:0 "Imperial Corrections"
  SOL_imperial_corrections_desc:0 "There a number of governmental programs and policies that have been deemed unsuitable for a nation of our size. With the help of various advisors and consultants sent from [EQS.GetNameDef], the wheels of our politics should run smoother and with slightly less vitriol than before."
  SOL_GRI_griffon_exchange_students:0 "Imperial Exchange Program"
  SOL_GRI_griffon_exchange_students_desc:0 "Both of our empires have large military theory programs, and one of the best ways to further improve on our tactics is to experience the thought processes of others.

  SOL_shared_specialties_desc:0 "Through grit and determination, [EQS.GetLeader] and Grover have forged a strong, nearly familial bond. Through this, they have improved pony-griffon relations more than in potentially the last five generations. Synergies have been developed between both races, and lead to better cooperation i nthe field."
  SOL_prince_faisal:0 "Prince Faisal"
  SOL_prince_faisal_desc:0 "As recompense for the Empress saving him from most certain doom, Prince Faisal bin Saddle has agreed to be a figurehead for pony-horse unity. As he has been allowed to keep some autonomy, it is seen as an acceptable deal by both sides, as he keeps his "independence" and we` utilize some of his extensive wealth for our own purposes. Better that it's used by us than wasted on parties by him."
  SOL_unicorn_hit_squads:0 "Unicorn Hit Squads"
  SOL_unicorn_hit_squads_desc:0 "In exchange for being left to their devices, the mage archivists in [MTA.GetNameDef] have agreed to teach our unicorns many of their tricks they use for extracting artifacts.

  SOL_artifacts_galore:0 "Artifacts Galore"
  SOL_artifacts_galore_desc:0 "Knowledge is power, and it must be guarded well. It's disappointing that [MTA.GetNameDef] didn't provide much of a fight, but the power within their archives allows our armies unlimited firepower, with only the small cost of perhaps a piece of the soul."

  SOL_eastern_sun_goddess_desc:0 ""From the Land of the Setting Sun, the Fire Goddess will one day return to guide her saved ponies into the light."\n\nThrough utilizing the twisted histories of her previous exploits in Maregypt, the Empress can control the populace of the south much more easily, and at the same time promote her own grandeur further for all the Empire to see."
  SOL_calipha_of_sun:0 "Pony Calipha"
  SOL_calipha_of_sun_desc:0 "Although an outsider, the Empress united the lands of Saddle Arabia like none could since its decline and eventual collapse.

  SOL_kirin_artists_desc:0 "As master creatives, barring their time in silence, kirin are best disposed to creating great works for the Empress to show to the world.

  SOL_nirik_commandos:0 "Nirik Commandos"
  SOL_nirik_commandos_desc:0 "A nirik is a fearsome creature, but it's a creature on our side. Integrating kirin who can control their inner beast into our special forces and training them in effectively using these assets in the field is paramount to furthering Harmony's goals."

  SOL_kirin_war_masters_desc:0 "There have been great writers of military theory in times past from the kirin, and with the Silence lifted, encouraging more of that behavior through grants and conscription exemption will lead to novel ideas that can be applied to the battlefields of the future."

  SOL_civil_war_measures_idea_desc:0 "Times of crisis call for desperate measures. In civil war, there cannot be debates about what is right or ethical, but only decisions on what gets things accomplished.

  SOL_minimal_training_requirements:0 "Minimal Training Requirements"
  SOL_minimal_training_requirements_desc:0 "We require every mare and stallion serving on the front lines to win this war. Cutting unnecessary material from our conscripts' days such as how to clean a gun or proper military jargon provides more hooves for fighting the enemy. They can get their experience in the field."
  SOL_inflationary_spending:0 "Inflationary Spending"
  SOL_inflationary_spending_desc:0 "Grants and subsidies for industry as well as rebates for the common pony allow for more bits to circulate in the economy. When production meets demand, then we can stop running deficits to maintain Order. One has to spend money to make money, after all."
  SOL_counter_insurgents:0 "Counter-Insurgents"
  SOL_counter_insurgents_desc:0 "True followers of Harmony will never abide terrorists and oppressors squating on our land.

  SOL_motivational_speakers:0 "Citizen Motivational Teams"
  SOL_motivational_speakers_desc:0 "Through faithful workers who have studied the differences between our citizens and our former brethren, we can inform the populace how we are the only true followers of Harmony. "Propaganda" is too harsh a word. The Empress prefers "correct instruction.""
  SOL_desperate_drafting:0 "Desperate Drafts"
  SOL_desperate_drafting_desc:0 "If ponies wish to live to retirement age, they will need to take up arms. If they are already retired, they can take up a screwdriver. If they are too young to work, they can take up a hammer."

  SOL_efficient_command_structure:0 "Restructured Command Hierarchy"
  SOL_efficient_command_structure_desc:0 "Much of the cruft of the old regime has been relegated to minor roles within the new Militarium. Everypony ultimately reports to the Empress, and her representative, the Lord Commander, has total visibility into every action within the army."
  SOL_relegated_embarrassments:0 "Neutered Harmonists"
  SOL_relegated_embarrassments_desc:0 "Executing skilled commanders comes with a price, and while removing the generals who have remained insubordinate or stubborn would be easiest, it is better to provide them "work" that they can toil on endlessly. There is no better punishment for a soldier on the front lines than paperwork."
  SOL_optimized_bureaucracy:0 "Optimized Bureaucracy"
  SOL_optimized_bureaucracy_desc:0 "For something to get from one place to the next, there must be a formal supply chain. What was once had in the old military was acceptable, but it could be slow or have unacceptable losses. Keeping track of every detail will keep our soldiers supplied, once they can figure out the forms to sign."
  SOL_flammenwerfers:0 "Fire Launchers"
  SOL_flammenwerfers_desc:0 "Through a combination of various chemicals, magic, and a dash of citrus infusion for fragrance, our troops can launch fire like the most skilled of mages. It is highly recommended to not burn down CO's houses with it if angry."
  SOL_iterative_planning:0 "Iterative Planning"
  SOL_iterative_planning_desc:0 "Our soldiers must be prepared for any scenario that may present itself on the battlefield. Through constant theorizing, achieving a level of preparedness may be achievable. Plans will survive an encounter, unlike what so many believe."
  SOL_motorized_spearheads:0 "Motorized Spearheads"
  SOL_motorized_spearheads_desc:0 "A modern army requries a modern response mechanism. Infantry are still useful, but they are too slow to properly respond to gaps, which is where the charge of mechanized forces comes in. Through extensive training and further contracts for more supplies, we will be able to rapidly breach or respond to intrusions with our troops."
  SOL_artillery_safety_removals:0 "Safety Refinements"
  SOL_artillery_safety_removals_desc:0 "With big guns come much responsibility, and artillery is the largest weapon on the battlefield. However, there are many fears around it, and precautions that have hindered effectiveness have been implemented in the past. Why do they need to check simple things if it's working? Just fire another round."
  SOL_napalm_shells:0 "Napalm Shells"
  SOL_napalm_shells_desc:0 "Watchdogs may decry this as excessive force and brutality, but the Empress calls it righteous judgement and efficient clearing of enemy territory. Loading our artillery with high-yield napalm shells will keep a clean swathe of land in combat and quickly clear any skirmish"
  SOL_practice_combat:0 "Excessive Wargaming"
  SOL_practice_combat_desc:0 "Only through extensive field exercises and practice can we think of every way to combat an enemy. Plans will survive encounters only if they have been thoroughly tested in the war room and in the field with friendly troops first."

  SOL_mobile_flame_deliverers:0 "Mobile Flame Deliverers"
  SOL_mobile_flame_deliverers_desc:0 "One of the most difficult problems with cleansing everything with the Holy Flame is that it doesn't move very quickly, relying on infantry or mages to spread it and purify a battlefield. Through enhancing specialized tanks for the work, we can clear entire swaths of territory with little effort or danger."
  SOL_no_standards:0 "Zero Standards"
  SOL_no_standards_desc:0 "With ever-growing numbers of soldiers, we must meet their demands and provide for them. Even our already simplified designs need to be streamlined further. Does it matter if a gun explodes in a pony's hoof if it still shoots a bullet and we have five more waiting for the soldier?"
  SOL_numbers_on_page:0 "Numbers Only"
  SOL_numbers_on_page_desc:0 "It is not a soldier's duty to question orders given, nor is it a citizen's right to refuse conscription into the Militarium.

  SOL_evoker_legions:0 "Evoker Legions"
  SOL_evoker_legions_desc:0 "Integrating mage companies into the Militarium is paramount for continued success, and all unicorns will be required to understand the basics of summoning destructive elements on the battlefield. If it is a problem that can't be solved, a fireball will usually do the trick."
  SOL_pb_magic_idea:0 "Magitech Integration"
  SOL_pb_magic_idea_desc:0 "Magical Energy Weapons are works of art, but times must change to feed our growing infantry corps. No more will many of these weapons be crafted by artisans, but through adding in mundane technology for non-critical components, they will be able to be mass produced for defending Harmony."
  SOL_second_gen_crystals:0 "Second Generation Matrices"
  SOL_second_gen_crystals_desc:0 "Crystal matrices can only hold so much magic before their charge fizzles out and they are left useless. Creating new etching methods allows for better storage and dispensing of that held energy, with only minor sacrifices to the matrix's durability."
  SOL_armored_hoofs:0 "Armored Hoofs"
  SOL_armored_hoofs_desc:0 "As the battlefield is dominated by infantry and unarmored forces, creating dedicated tank groups for spearheading into enemy lines will lead to terrifying damage. Refining and reinforcing said tanks to take hits from anti-armor weaponry and other armored forces will ensure that destruction."

  ###Air Force###
  SOL_sirens_of_fear:0 "Fear Sirens"
  SOL_sirens_of_fear_desc:0 "Through adding an audio indicator for our pilots of when to pull up from a dive, we not only give them a way to judge when to pull out of a dive, but we also provide a warning to our enemies that it is already too late to run and hide. A mortified enemy is as a good as a dead enemy, and they will cower at the sound of a hundred planes charging at them with the Empress's righteous judgement!"
  SOL_napalm_strikes:0 "Napalm Strikes"
  SOL_napalm_strikes_desc:0 "Equipping our dive bombers with napalm gives them additional ways in which to terrorize the enemy. As they are much more accurate than long-range bombers, we can directly administer fire to pockets of enemy resistance, while keeping the battlefield safe for our own forces while their foes perish in an inferno."
  SOL_pegasi_planes:0 "Pegasi Emulation"
  SOL_pegasi_planes_desc:0 "Through careful observation and study of pegasi, we can implement a few tricks into making our planes and dive bombers more effective. Improved wing flaps and ailerons as well as tweaks to the rigidity of the bodies has them flit and dash through the air, like the nimblest of pegasi."
  SOL_dive_bombers_justice:0 "Dives of Justice"
  SOL_dive_bombers_justice_desc:0 "Our dive bombers are masters at instilling fear and regret into our enemies. Although they dive into the heat of battle, they gladly take any risk to burn out the rot and corruption of our rivals. They are the Empress's sword in the field."
  SOL_streamlined_bombers:0 "Streamlined Bomber Production"
  SOL_streamlined_bombers_desc:0 "Heavy bombers are an expensive investment, and finding ways to cut costs and production time will improve our standing in the long run. It's not like there has to be high-quality materials on the wings, anyway, so long as they fly. Replacing other components with cheaper alternatives would also be of benefit."
  SOL_thestral_vision_scopes:0 "Thestral-Vision Scopes"
  SOL_thestral_vision_scopes_desc:0 "One weakness of our crews is their inability to see well in the darkness. Although not actually mimicking the supposed night vision of thestrals, by outfitting our bombers with targeting scopes that can see in low-light conditions, they can more effectivley pummel our targets no matter the time of day."
  SOL_durable_bombers:0 "Fortress Bombers"
  SOL_durable_bombers_desc:0 "For bombers to survive, they must take a beating. Outfitting them with heavier plates, basic protection spell matrices, and with better turrets, they can get to their destination and return home, even if it costs a bit of joy-riding potential at the same time."
  SOL_napalm_carpeting:0 "Napalm Carpeting"
  SOL_napalm_carpeting_desc:0 "Fire cleanses everything, and the targets that our bombers are given require extensive purification. There's no need to be accurate when the flames carried will spread through a city and purge any corruption within."
  SOL_limitless_bombing:0 "Limitless Bombing"
  SOL_limitless_bombing_desc:0 "We must consistently strike fear into those who oppose us through our reach. Their citizens far from the front may think they are safe from the Empress's retribution, but they are not. There will be no discrimination as we level their cities to dust."
  SOL_involuntary_testing_procedures:0 "Involuntary Testing Procedures"
  SOL_involuntary_testing_procedures_desc:0 "Ethics is not applicable to those who stand against Harmony and Order. From the thousands who have resisted us within our own lands, we can choose whomever we wish to be the latest subjects in our live flight tests. If we lose one, we can always find another."
  SOL_everypony_ace:0 "Everypony an Ace"
  SOL_everypony_ace_desc:0 "One danger of an air force is one day running out of pilots. However, the exploits of fighter aces always capture the hearts and minds of young and old alike, and if we perhaps invent a few with subtle propagnda, as well as allow these "aces" their own tours to greet everypony, we can easily drum up recruitment numbers, and motivate our new pilots to great feats."
  SOL_balanced_air_powers:0 "Balanced Departmental Roles"
  SOL_balanced_air_powers_desc:0 "For the Imperial Air Force to function, it must maintain balance. There are numerous factions within it, with the fighter-bomber and true bomber wings the most prominent.

  SOL_ponies_to_sky:0 "Ponies of the Sky"
  SOL_ponies_to_sky_desc:0 "Not everypony can performa a sonic rainboom, but everypony can learn to fly. As a third of our race live in the sky, it is only natural we promote training campaigns among them and everypony. We are the natural champions of the sky, and nocreature will change that."

  SOL_magic_bonded_plating:0 "Magic-Bonded Plating"
  SOL_magic_bonded_plating_desc:0 "While armor plating is already extremely thick on our battleships, they are only mundane, and can take so much punishment before breaking.

  SOL_status_quo_superiority:0 "Status Quo Superiority"
  SOL_status_quo_superiority_desc:0 "The naval traditions of [ROOT.GetNameDef] go back hundreds of years and they have yet to let us down. Some adaptation may be necessary, but using the standard of more powerful guns and more durable armor will ensure that we control the seas for decades longer."
  SOL_cut_ship_hull_heavy_corners:0 "Cut Manufacturing Corners"
  SOL_cut_ship_hull_heavy_corners_desc:0 "A battleship takes far too long to produce at the current demand that we require them. Relenting on some of the unnecessary checks and balances allows us to pump them out like never before. They might spring more leaks, but ten of them versus two of our enemies' matters more."
  SOL_sacrificial_light_ships:0 "Sacrificial Light Ships"
  SOL_sacrificial_light_ships_desc:0 "Screen ships have always carried a mixed role in our navy, and never had something clearly defined. However, recent doctrinal changes have given them a clear role: they must protect our capitals at any cost. To that end, they don't need to last long, they just need to take a hit when it could have been a battleship or carrier instead."
  SOL_coordinated_carrier_classes:0 "Designated Carrier Classes"
  SOL_coordinated_carrier_classes_desc:0 "With the move away from old manner of navies, carriers must fill multiple roles. Our admiralty has begun the process, and through it, our carrier captains are able to more efficiently control the skies through their synchronized tactics."
  SOL_expansive_carriers:0 "Mobile Settlements"
  SOL_expansive_carriers_desc:0 "With carriers being so large, it should be an aspect leaned into. Designing our future carriers to have heavier plating and larger landing strips gives both our crews more breathing room and even more powerful weapons to pummel enemy forces."
  SOL_unreachable_lengths:0 "Uncreachable Lengths"
  SOL_unreachable_lengths_desc:0 "Stripping back many of the unnecessary weight of a carrier, through reduced armor and capacity, we can travel further than ever. A weaker carrier that can hit targets is better than no carier at all."
  SOL_combined_naval_arms:0 "Combined Naval Arms"
  SOL_combined_naval_arms_desc:0 "Just like with land, there are multiple roles that ships fill, and they must do so competently. Carriers are our heavy hitters, but they are vulnerable to traditional ships. If our other vessels understand this, and plan for this, then our strike groups will remain unstoppable."
  SOL_high_seas_empire:0 "A High Seas Empire"
  SOL_high_seas_empire_desc:0 "The Imperial Navy has protected the seas around the Empire for generations, and with the coming of the Empress's ascension, has new purpose. In an empire that spans multiple continents, it is up to them to be a first line of defense against foreign invasion from Griffonia or Zebrica. Through guarding our assets abroad, they maintain the adage that the Sun never sets on the Solar Empire."

  ###Ministry of Defense###
  SOL_bug_spray:0 "Spot the Changeling"

  SOL_icy_naval_practice:0 "Northern Naval Exercises"

  SOL_beachheading_practice:0 "Beachhead Scenarios"
  SOL_beachheading_practice_desc:0 "Eventually, wars with intercontinental powers will be an inevitable, if Harmony is to survive. Running through different scenarios will allow our troops the opportunity to experience the chaos of a naval invasion without the threat of death. Often, anyway."
  SOL_wholistic_survival_training:0 "Wholistic Approach"
  SOL_wholistic_survival_training_desc:0 "Dangers exist everywhere. Through series of exercises, strewn across our territories, our soldiers and commanders can gain valuable knowledge of how the environment can shape a battle. Additional emphasis will be placed on taking advantage of the terrain, as well as how to properly prepare for the most obscene conditions on the planet."
  SOL_coordinated_arms:0 "Coordinated Arms"
  SOL_coordinated_arms_desc:0 "The [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] Military must move past the separate concept of factions and departments that, while not against each other, are not for each other's interests, either. Further cross training, promotions from one department to another, and general training in each's tactics will give them all an understanding of the other offices, which will allow for better synergy."
  SOL_planning_in_order:0 "Order in Planning"
  SOL_planning_in_order_desc:0 "There must be stability and a process by which all orders and commands be given out to the soldiers. Only when there is a properly conceived battleplan should we attempt to fight. Plans are, after all, indespensible."

  SOL_CRY_imperial_capital_desc:0 "As our economy still lags behind [EQS.GetNameDef], [EQS.GetLeader] has generously provided from the royal treasury to assist with kickstarting more of our own industry.

  SOL_solarist_education:0 "Solarist Education"
  SOL_solarist_education_desc:0 "Too much free thought has been allowed to flourish in the universities in [ROOT.GetNameDef].

  SOL_solarist_minds:0 "A Solarist Mind"
  SOL_solarist_minds_desc:0 "Just because our students may not choose their subjects freely doesn't mean they are without liberty. Instructions in proper obedience to [EQS.GetLeader] provides a realistic view of their life's value, and has subsequently given them more motivation to toil in our industries for her benefit, as well as asking the questions about our magic's power, so that it may properly be used by her."
  SOL_micromanaging_middle_management:0 "Economic Guidance"
  SOL_micromanaging_middle_management_desc:0 "Our industry is not where it should be, even with investments from the Crown.

  SOL_dictated_directions:0 "Dictated Military"
  SOL_dictated_directions_desc:0 "Until we can prove ourselves as loyal subjects, [EQS.GetLeader] has rescinded our right to an independent army. Our soldiers have been given new commanders and will listen only to [EQS.GetLeader] or her representative here. Our generals are seething, but we must sort out our disorder there first before we can hope to be free again."
  SOL_aegis_guard:0 "Guardian of the North"
  SOL_aegis_guard_desc:0 "With it clear we will follow the Empress's commands, our armed forces now have a new directive.

  SOL_kabuh:0 "Flurry Heart"
  SOL_kabuh_desc:0 "The Empress's young grandniece has been brought to [ROOT.GetNameDef] to complete her education under the watchful eyes of Daybreaker.

  SOL_heartbroken_caddy:0 "Heartrender"
  SOL_heartbroken_caddy_desc:0 "Although she was resistant, even the Empress's niece has fallen into line.

  SOL_griffonian_refuge:0 "A Refuge in Griffonia"
  SOL_griffonian_refuge_desc:0 "There are always some that wish to start anew elsewhere in the world, or hear the wonders of Harmony and Order and wish to join. As a land of immigrants, we welcome all with open arms, and ensure that all will be treated fairly so long as they obey and keep Order."
  SOL_correct_warfare:0 "Correct Ways of Warfare"
  SOL_correct_warfare_desc:0 "Much of our military is grass roots, and hasn't had much action since the "Great" Cockatrice War. We have an organized structure, but discipline sometimes is lacking, at least to [EQS.GetAdjectiveCap] standards. With new training programs and manuals given to our commanders, that will be turned around, as we become an extension of the [EQS.GetAdjectiveCap] Military on Griffonia."

  ###Industry###
  SOL_dedicated_ministry_of_work:0 "Dedicated Work Ministry"
  SOL_dedicated_ministry_of_work_desc:0 "Free enterprise can often lead to chaos within the economy. Only through a watchdog organization can that be avoided.

  SOL_magic_laden_explosives:0 "Magic-Laden Explosives"
  SOL_magic_laden_explosives_desc:0 "Gunpowder is already deadly enough. Infusing that powder with explosive magic will only further improve its destructive power. While dangerous, the benefits of improving our artillery shells through these enchantments will allow for more efficient assaults by our forces. The spells themselves can also be utilized by our mages to become walking bomb dispensers."
  SOL_self_improvement_programs:0 "Self-Improvement Programs"
  SOL_self_improvement_programs_desc:0 "Through pursuing techniques to focus on their inner-thaumaturgic wells, our mages that have participated in some of Sol Victoria's early research programs have come back calmer and more focused. Their magic, likewise, is stronger for it. Although it affects everypony differently, by providing more of these programs to our battle mages, we can keep them cool and collected under fire, with magic to level our enemies at a moment's notice."
  SOL_food_above_all:0 "Mandated Food Production"
  SOL_food_above_all_desc:0 "Our nation was built on the backs of earth ponies, who continue to provide the sustenence our growing populace needs. Industry has threatened that over time, however.

  SOL_unhindered_mining:0 "Unhindered Mining"
  SOL_unhindered_mining_desc:0 "Unfathomable wealth lies beneath the surface of [ROOT.GetNameDef], much of it being locked away by red tape and environmental concerns. Removing this bureaucratic nonsense will greatly improve our total productivity for the military. There will probably be protests, and the effect on population is not yet known, but that's a sacrifice to be made for protecting Harmony."
  SOL_unions_of_the_empress:0 "Limited Union Approval"
  SOL_unions_of_the_empress_desc:0 "To quell the potential risk of strikes and worker action, the Empress has approved that laborers may form unions and negotiate for fairer pay and working conditions. However, much of the power will remain with her over what their fate will be. Already, swaths of ponies are uniting to form unions that can look out for each other, just as Harmony intends."
  SOL_committee_design:0 "Committee Design"
  SOL_committee_design_desc:0 "Expansions to the IWS allow for further inspection and control of the output of the economy. Random drop-ins, weekly quota provisions, and new hoofbooks regarding safe operation procedures will stratify and organize industry into various tiers, which will have various levels of autonomy. Most critical aspects will no control over themselves. They're too valuable to let fall to folly."
  SOL_micromanaged_industry:0 "Micromanaged Industry"
  SOL_micromanaged_industry_desc:0 "Work teams may have the say of the day in the factory, but the Empress has the final call on all aspects of how to work. Guidelines are critical for a safe and productive work environment, and the Empress has approved the use of a new, two-thousand-and-seventy-three page manual, which details every little requirement of an approved job environment. If one every wants to know how to properly use a toaster on break, these are the books for them."
  SOL_motivated_workers:0 "Worker Motivation"
  SOL_motivated_workers_desc:0 "Ponies can be fickle, and workers even more. With the growing oversight of the IWS, there are still outliers who must be brought on board with the Empress's economic plans. Through appointment of loyal workers who may inform the IWS of anything awry, the factory floor will remain a productive environment. Complaints of toxic coworkers will be ignored, as they are only carrying out the Empress's business."
  SOL_timberwolf_research:0 "Project Everfree Research"
  SOL_timberwolf_research_desc:0 "With the lifting of mining corporations' best, our efforts at improving our armor projects have taken off.

  SOL_crystal_robotics:0 "Autonomous Creators"
  SOL_crystal_robotics_desc:0 "One of the most time-consuming tasks of a factory floor is assembling along the assembly line. Although they are meant to be fast, the limiting factor is ponypower and skill. With advancing technology, though, automated arms, called "robots," can replace them. Further funding of this research and grants provided to guinea pig factories will motivate them enough to try this new frontier of productivity. Complaints about machines taking over will be sent to the nearest paper shredder."
  SOL_refined_metal_bodies:0 "Refined Metal Bodies"
  SOL_refined_metal_bodies_desc:0 "A battleship has been always been a battleship. A tank has always been a tank. Looking at these with fresh eyes gives us opportunity to see where cost saving measures can be utilized to reduce complexity without sacrificing durability. Reclamation centers for scrap metal will also provide more resources for non-critical components in our heaviest weapons."
  SOL_mto:0 "Ministry of Transportation"
  SOL_mto_desc:0 "Establishing a national set of standards and appointing a new department for governing the extensive tracks across [ROOT.GetNameDef] shall provide swift and efficient service to all vestiges of our nation.

  SOL_star_energy_nationalized:0 "Star Energy Nationalized"
  SOL_star_energy_nationalized_desc:0 "Through forced resignations, expensive buyouts, and a few threats, the Empress has gained enough of a stake within Star Energy to force it into the public sphere, where the Crown has completely bought out its assets and applied them to the Empire's purposes. Most of its property has been sold to recoup expenses, but their technology will last decades into the future."
  SOL_crystal_powered_radar:0 "Crystal-Powered RADAR"
  SOL_crystal_powered_radar_desc:0 "Through integrating crystal matrices into a RADAR device, the frequency and power can be boosted, providing longer range detection and more fidelity.

  SOL_early_crystal_cpus_desc:0 "Although not autonomously intelligent, new crystal matrices developed by researchers at MIT can take inputs and outputs provided by electronic or magical signal, and use that energy to perform provided calculations far faster than mortal ponies could ever hope to achieve.

  SOL_dragon_laborers_twiggles:0 "Lucrative Labor"
  SOL_dragon_laborers_twiggles_desc:0 "Through negotiation and enlightenment of the dragons, the Lady Inquisitor has put them in their place. As basic laborers, they will be used for the harshest jobs where ponies could be better suited elsewhere. Gems are in abundance here, so payment in exchange for other resources is a pittance."
  SOL_dragon_laborers_shim_sham:0 "Lucrative Labor"
  SOL_dragon_laborers_shim_sham_desc:0 "By rightly pointing out the benefits of dragons aiding the survival of Harmony, Dawnbreak Shimmer has placed the dragons in their proper position in society. Due to their endurance, they will supplement factory labor, where they can toil for far more hours than a pony. Payment in gems is nothing to the increased productivity."
  SOL_native_oil_shim_sham:0 "Imperial Oil Grants"
  SOL_native_oil_shim_sham_desc:0 "We have agreed to investments from [EQS.GetNameDef] and assigning more of our population to natural resources in exchange for [EQS.GetNameDef] getting a cut of the profits.

  SOL_solar_griffon_attache_SOL_desc:0 "In agreement with [GRD.GetNameDef], a military delegation of ponies and designers from us have been placed in Griffenheim.

  ###NLR Ideas, Wow!###
  SOL_nmm_prisoner:0 "Nightmare Moon"
  SOL_nmm_prisoner_desc:0 "With the end of the civil war, the Empress has apprehended her rebellious sister for all to see. Not even blood will prevent her from administering justice, but death is too good for her, lest she become a martyr. Displaying the fate of all those who defy the work of Order and Harmony is more than sufficient."

  ###Operations Ideas###
  CHN_furious_populace:0 "Outraged Populace"
  CHN_furious_populace_desc:0 "In the aftermath of [EQS.GetNameDef]'s brazen attack against our queen, our populace has rallied around her even more than before. Her injuries only fuel our fury against [EQS.GetLeader] and prove that [EQS.GetNameDef] must be punished for how it has humiliated us time and again."
  NLR_military_disarray:0 "Military in Disarray"
  NLR_military_disarray_desc:0 "A number of our officers have been captured or killed by agents operating under [EQS.GetLeader]. None of us thought that [EQS.GetLeader.GetSheHe] would be capable of such ruthlessness, and our military is struggling to find replacements for our losses."
  SOL_sabotaged_tanks:0 "S.M.I.L.E. Retaliation"
  SOL_sabotaged_tanks_desc:0 "Despite offering amnesty, the S.M.I.L.E. agents we permitted to stay with us have betrayed our trust and lashed out like petulant foals at some of our armor operations. Those that have been found have been dealt with, but the damage they have inflicted will take time to repair and recover."

  ###Spies###
  SOL_defensive_propaganda:0 "Bolstering Messages"
  SOL_defensive_propaganda_desc:0 "Every mouthpiece has already been given what to say. Every newspaper has already had its news written for it.

  SOL_offensive_propaganda:0 "Demoralizing Messaging"
  SOL_offensive_propaganda_desc:0 "Our airwaves are breached daily from [EQS.GetNameDef] with lies and falsehoods aimed to weaken our citizens' resolve in our fight against [EQS.GetLeader]. Despite the efforts of [ROOT.GetLeader] to sway public opinion in favor of us, the constant bombardments from [EQS.GetNameDef] have hindered our national pride and stability."

  ###Shhhhhhhh!###
  SOL_imperium_solaris_aeterna:0 "Imperium Solaris Aeterna"
  SOL_imperium_solaris_aeterna_desc:0 "The God-Empress has fully subdued this continent. From the coasts to the most remote inland town, they speak her praises and readily comply with her demands for sacrifice for the betterment of Harmony. Any heresy is repressed until there nothing remains but complete dedication to Her and to Order."

  ###Focuses###
  ###Sunset's Corruption###
  SOL_sunset_awaken:0 "Awakening"
  SOL_sunset_awaken_desc:0 "The Empress's prodigal student has been returned to her at last. Unlike Twilight Sparkle, Sunset Shimmer has had a consistent history of individualism and rash judgements. Chaos once flowed through her, but with that corruption's taste, it has given her perspective. No longer will she serve her whims and strive against our Harmony. When dawn breaks, she will seek Order."

  ###Civil War###
  SOL_civil_war_measures:0 "The Civil War Emergencies Act"
  SOL_civil_war_measures_desc:0 "There is a time and a place for debate and discussion on the benefits of a new law, and that time has long passed. We are surrounded by traitors and rebels, who spread lies as they pillage every inch of land that rightfully belongs to Daybreaker. The Empress has forced through multiple measures and reforms meant to combat these foes. Everypony will follow her, whether they want to or not."
  SOL_promise_swift_end:0 "Promise Swift Ends"
  SOL_promise_swift_end_desc:0 "Our enemies are not external from the villainous changelings or the traitorous communists, but from our own brethren, who pledged to always uphold Harmony. Their fates are already sealed.

  SOL_crisis_industrial_management:0 "Crisis Industrial Management"
  SOL_crisis_industrial_management_desc:0 "In normal times, the captains of industry that have brought wealth and prosperity to all those who follow the Empress would be left to their own devices. But we are not in that state. Where many believe they can supply trinkets, they must instead construct guns. Appointing an emergency council to oversee these transitions will be unpopular but necessary."
  SOL_draw_upon_militia:0 "Draw upon Regional Militia"
  SOL_draw_upon_militia_desc:0 "Across [ROOT.GetNameDef], there are pockets of loyal ponies who, while they have little formal training, have taken up arms to fight for Harmony.

They may be unruly, but at least they are on our side."
  SOL_counter_terrorists:0 "Counter Terrorism"
  SOL_counter_terrorists_desc:0 "Throughout the nation, there are groups of ponies who have remained faithful to Harmony and have done what they can to make life difficult for our enemies.

  SOL_spending_money:0 "Mitigating Bit Injections"
  SOL_spending_money_desc:0 "When half the country secedes, there is an understandable loss of production, but demand has not slowed to the same degree. While this is temporary, and could cause issues in the long term, minting additional bits for ponies to buy suddenly more expensive goods will stimulate the economy enough that we can overpower our enemies and ideally pay off our debts afterward."
  SOL_herald_doom:0 "Herald Coming Doom"
  SOL_herald_doom_desc:0 "The lives of our enemies are already forfeit. When they determined in vain to fight against the Sun and Harmony itself, they gave up their right to existence. Everypony who obeys the Empress must be made aware of this. Sympathy is a weakness. Order demands that unity be paramount, and those who do not unite will be destroyed!"
  SOL_take_everypony:0 "Press Any Into Service"
  SOL_take_everypony_desc:0 "We cannot afford to be picky when it comes to conscription. The very fate of Harmony itself is in the balance. No matter the pony - young, old, mare, stallion - they must be brought in to fight against our enemies. Some may falter. Some may struggle. All will fight on the field, so that we may bury our enemies in bodies!"
  SOL_reconquer_equestria:0 "Bring Back the Foalish"
  SOL_reconquer_equestria_desc:0 "In the civil war, many "nations" believed that they could claim their "right" to independence. In their delusion, they think they can survive this world without the light and protection of the Sun. They are wrong. The Empress will bring them back into [ROOT.GetNameDef], for there can be only one. Unity is the natural state of ponies, and she will deliver it."

  SOL_waking_dawn_star_desc:0 "Equestria burns all around us, but in our darkest hour, the first sign of hope has sprung forth. Celestia is no longer, for she has been reborn. The bright light of the Sun shall guide us, and in its warmth we shall crush all those that threaten us!"

  SOL_fire_ministers_desc:0 "The old privy council of Princess Celestia has yet to meet their new Empress and they are still under the belief that blind faith to the old understanding of Harmony is what guides [ROOT.GetNameDef].

  SOL_bluebloods_fealty:0 "Require Blueblood's Fealty"
  SOL_bluebloods_fealty_desc:0 "Prince Blueblood has proven to be both efficient and ruthless on the battlefield, but has thus far ignored any communications from the Empress to confirm his loyalty. This will not do, as a military needs a field marshal, and he shall serve perfectly. It's time for a little family visit."
  SOL_appoint_committee:0 "Appoint a Committee of War"
  SOL_appoint_committee_desc:0 "Although many of the wartime measures that have been implemented through the Empress have had an effect, there has not been a body designated to coordinate the economy and ensure that it can be fully tooled and efficiently provide for our soldiers.

  SOL_answer_crimes:0 "Answer Crimes with Crimes"
  SOL_answer_crimes_desc:0 "Ponies within our nation seem to believe that they have the ability to protest and affect this new change in the Empress. They are nothing but misguided foals, raising their voices against the wind, hoping that they can drown it out when they should rather embrace the direction it takes them. Like foals, they must, and will be, corrected."
  SOL_sweeping_chaff:0 "Sweeping out the Chaff"
  SOL_sweeping_chaff_desc:0 "Dissention within the military has reached an all-time high, as companies and armies have been split in their support of the Empress or their incorrect understanding of what true Harmony is. Many are impossible to convince that the Empress is the only way forward, and they will have to be dealt with. Permanently."
  SOL_first_feelers:0 "The First Feelers"
  SOL_first_feelers_desc:0 "Although cleansing of the government is still underway, that does not preclude use from searching for replacements for those who once comprised the privy council of the Empress.

  SOL_break_dissent:0 "Crack Down on Open Dissent"
  SOL_break_dissent_desc:0 "Despsite efforts to contain official news media, that has not prevented grass-roots organizations from utilizing the airwaves to broadcast news from the front or organize local protests. These stations are a danger to us all, and additionally, spread harmful misinformation about the Empress. It is time that the glove be removed from her iron hoof."
  SOL_plants_in_chaos:0 "Plants in Chaos"
  SOL_plants_in_chaos_desc:0 "Some soldiers and officers have hid their doubts better than others, but they still leave evidence that they are working against the Empress. Although they are not public, like those who have been dealt with, they can still cause damage. Planting a few loyal soldiers in all companies will ensure that the truth is exposed and the guilty judged."
  SOL_personal_training:0 "Personal Training"
  SOL_personal_training_desc:0 "While Prince Blueblood was instructed well during his time in military college, he has become rather arrogant in his abilities. Arrogance can kill.\n\nAs he is her only kin, the Empress has taken a renewed interest in his knowledge of war. He will learn from her, whether he wants to or not."
  SOL_reward_loyal:0 "Reward the Loyal"
  SOL_reward_loyal_desc:0 "Raven Inkwell has been the faihtful servant of the Empress for almost a decade, silently and diligently going about her work and keeping the government running smoothly.

  SOL_arbitrary_judgement:0 "Arbitrary Judgements"
  SOL_arbitrary_judgement_desc:0 "There is only way to deal with the chaos that has been wrought upon us internally.

Trial not requried."
  SOL_solidify_merger:0 "Solidify Merger"
  SOL_solidify_merger_desc:0 "With the onset of the war, the Empress, at the time, temporarily merged many of the civilian and military offices together to establish a smooth and straightforward chain of command within [ROOT.GetNameDef]. However, it is not a permanent solution, and something that codifies what magister deals with what must be created, lest everything wrought in a time of crisis fail during peace."
  SOL_suns_son:0 "The Sun's Son"
  SOL_suns_son_desc:0 "Despite his initial protests regarding his training, Blueblood has taken well to the lessons given to him. Much of the Empress's mindset has rubbed off on him, and he has taken to more closely analyzing situations, and doling out appropriate punishment for those who commit crimes against her. With him by the Empress's side, nopony will dare to raise disagreement in her presence."

  SOL_judge_jury_executioner_desc:0 "With the very existence of [ROOT.GetNameDef] in peril from within and without, the niceties of "representation" and a "fair trial" are simply things that cannot be afforded.

  SOL_take_charge:0 "Take Personal Charge"
  SOL_take_charge_desc:0 "Foals and traitors abound within the lands of [ROOT.GetNameDef], leading us to Tartarus rather than safety.

The Sun itself will be our lamp and light. All shall taste its flame and perish!"
  SOL_successor_question:0 "The Question of a Successor"
  SOL_successor_question_desc:0 "The Empress is one mare, and she is without child. If the worst would happen, somepony would need to take up the reins of [ROOT.GetNameDef] in her place. It is incomprehensible, but every battle brings her into slight risk of grievous injury or death. There must be stability. There must be an annointed one to take her place."

  SOL_god_empress_desc:0 "The idea of worship was maligned and dissuaded by Princess Celestia, but that does not mean she was not a deity. After all, what mortal is able to raise the Sun itself? While many disagree, there is only one action that is fit for our Empress, nay, our GOD-EMPRESS. Our unending adoration is the only thing worthy of her. May the Sun shine forever! May the God-Empress be praised! SOL INVICTUS!"

  SOL_unveil_cultus_desc:0 "Since the God-Empress defated the Nightmare, there has always been a fringe movement who desired to see everypony worship her and see her as the deity that she is.

  SOL_solaris_adoratio_desc:0 "With the Cultus ingraining itself within society, its arm dedicated solely to the veneration of the God-Empress, the Solaris Adoratio, shall be given any and all resources it requires to see that She is worshiped from coast to coast.

  SOL_suffer_not_heresy_desc:0 "As the Adoratio continues to instruct more ponies in the sanity of the Empress's message, there are some who will clearly never acknowledge her as their rightful goddess.

As a thousand years or more of secularism has held onto society, there is much inertia that must be overcome, but Her subjects will provide, whether they wish to or not.

  SOL_Lux_et_Tenebris_desc:0 "It is a fact that how a pony is educated while they are young will dictate their beliefs as they grow older. At this time, the curriculum of the young has yet to be rewritten to provide proper, patriotic, religious schooling. Further efforts will be intensified, so that we may educate a generation of new worshipers that will guarantee the security of Harmony and the Empire itself."
  SOL_faith_honor_family:0 "Faith, Honor, Family"
  SOL_faith_honor_family_desc:0 "The God-Empress is not a tyrant. She is a loving mother, who merely wishes to see Her foals grow into a proper understanding of their place in Her world. It is every pony's duty to mirror this duty to their families. If they are not ready to sacrifice their all for those they love, how can they understand Her demands for their own lives? All shall better [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] society, one foal at a time."
  SOL_Faith_Sacrifice_Worship:0 "Faith, Sacrifice, Worship"
  #SOL_Faith_Sacrifice_Worship_desc:0 "The warm light of the Sun, so graciously provided by the God-Empress, is not without its price. The faithful must be prepared and willing to do everything to serve the Sun - even if it means their death."
  SOL_Faith_Sacrifice_Worship_desc:0 "The God-Empress is not an unreasonable mistress. For Her provision to Her ponies, she asks very little. As She gives graciously the warmth, protection, and light of the Sun, She requires that the faithful must be ready to sacrifice everything in Her goals, which are far above the thoughts of those below Her. Whether young, old, mare, or stallion, everything will be asked to be given, even if it's their very lives."
  SOL_field_executions:0 "Field Executions"
  SOL_field_executions_desc:0 "As our territory expands to bring the light of the God-Empress to all, there will be untold amount of insurrection, sin, and heresy. Not all of it can be tried in a court of law, for it would bog down the system to no end. Inquisitors in their roles of enforcing Her will upon the masses shall have a new liberty: anypony deemed guilty on inspection of heresy has forfeit their right to trial. They shall be cleansed immediately."
  SOL_State_Personified:0 "State Personified"
  #SOL_State_Personified_desc:0 "Her word is law, her thought is policy, her gesture is the direction to take. As the Sun moves across the sky, so does Equestria move with it. The Sun-Empress is truly the state itself."
  SOL_State_Personified_desc:0 "Princess Celestia may have surrounded herself with advisors, but they only weakened her will and corrupted the pure intentions of her heart. The God-Empress is not impotent like she, for She is the very Heart of the Empire itself. Every word that She speaks shall be law, and every direction She gives shall guide the whole nation. As our infallible Goddess, She is the only one who knows the true way forward."
  SOL_solar_games:0 "The Solar Games"
  SOL_solar_games_desc:0 "For generations, the Friendship Games were a unifying event that provided an outlet for the competitive nature that many ponies had within themselves. However, these outdated ideals that the games held to will only weaken society. They must be reworked. Reborn. The Solar Games will provide an avenue for ponies to prove their worth to the Empress and weed the weak from the strong."
  SOL_raising_generations:0 "Raising Generations"
  SOL_raising_generations_desc:0 "It is not the task of just one family to raise a foal, for it is the duty of everypony in their community to ensure that they are being reared to rightfully fear the awesome might of the God-Empress. The nation is dependent on the next generation to udnerstand their duty to Her. If they do not stop heresy when they see it, then it shall forever be a stain upon the entire community, and a mark of sin upon them all."
  SOL_better_than_best:0 "Better than Best"
  SOL_better_than_best_desc:0 "Who can compare themselves to the God-Empress? She is perfection. She is power incarnate. As the Sun scorches all that remain in it too long, She likewise is unstoppable. Upon the battlefield, She is unmatched. We can only hope to follow her into Tartarus and survive."
  SOL_sacrifices_from_birth:0 "Sacrifices from Birth"
  SOL_sacrifices_from_birth_desc:0 "Although the Cultus has grown since it was made the official state religion, it is still small compared to the general population. If we are to continue to expand and keep the God-Empress safe, it must grow with the populace. To that end, it is best to train the young of the nation within it from infancy. Whether their parents will agree with this is inconsequential."
  SOL_annual_purges:0 "Annual Purges"
  SOL_annual_purges_desc:0 "Complacency is something that can easily set in, and there is no better example of this than in government. While the God-Empress leads, there are hundreds of support staff for Her so that She need not concern Herself with trivial affairs. Lest they be allowed to grow fat and lazy, they shall constantly be evaluated. If they do not measure up, they will feel Her wrath."
  SOL_enlightened_education:0 "Enlightened Education"
  SOL_enlightened_education_desc:0 "In the halls of universities across the Empire, students are taught to think critically, but they are not instructed on what they must ponder. If left undirected, they could come to incorrect conclusions regarding the Empire, Order, and Harmony. If we are to secure our nation as it matures, they must be pointed back to the correct conclusions, or face the consequences of their rebellion."
  SOL_tradition_of_worship:0 "Tradition of Worship"
  SOL_tradition_of_worship_desc:0 "Ponies across the Empire have held to various cultural traditions for centuries. It is in the mortal mass's nature to find ways to add to their life rituals and routines. While secularism has been a mainstay since Nightmare Moon's defeat, it can be undone. Finding ways to creep worship into life outside of the local church will further strengthen our social unity, and ensure the populace will obey the God-Empress."
  SOL_sacrifices_on_assembly_line:0 "Sacrifices on the Assembly Line"
  SOL_sacrifices_on_assembly_line_desc:0 "While the Empire has a strong industrial base, we must always be ready for the next threat that may arise to Harmony and Order. Every chance that a pony has must be put into their work, as a form of worship to the God-Empress. As their bones break, their bodies wear out, and their minds tire, they will give their all to Her, so that She may guard the light of Harmony forever!"
  SOL_generals_above_rest:0 "Generals Above the Rest"
  SOL_generals_above_rest_desc:0 "It is not only the Militarium that has bright minds for leading everypony in the defense of the Empire. Within the Solaris Cultus and Inquisitionis, there are many ponies who are gifted in leadership. Who says that they cannot lead the troops, even if they do not answer to the Imperial High Command? They answer only to the God-Empress, and their instructions will be clearer and purer than any general."
  SOL_fodder_troops:0 "Fodder Troops"
  SOL_fodder_troops_desc:0 "There are no shortage of ponies who have been convicted of heresy, rebellion, and unbelief within our jails. Although they can be examples when they are cleansed by flame, they can only be so once. If we use them as forward squads, they can be useful AND be purified in a different kind of fire, while saving the Inquisitionis valuable time for more heresy hunting."
  SOL_combine_church_and_state:0 "Combine Church and State"
  SOL_combine_church_and_state_desc:0 "The root of the issue with the old government was that there was no moral framework to which they could properly align themselves. Therefore, they grew corrupt, greedy, complacent, and stupid. Keeping the Cultus and the government rungs beneath the God-Empress separate is a mistake. A mistake that shall be rectified immediately."
  SOL_honorable_guards:0 "Honorable Guards"
  SOL_honorable_guards_desc:0 "The Royal Guard of old was little more than a showpiece. Where were they when Chrysalis invaded in 1002? What good were they when Tirek nearly destroyed the nation in 1004? In light of their incompetence, the call shall go out. The most gifted shall become the honor guard of the God-Empress, and they shall lay down their lives at the slightest hint of danger to Her."
  SOL_monsters_of_earth:0 "Monsters of the Earth"
  SOL_monsters_of_earth_desc:0 "There are few weapons that can inspire fear and awe like the heavy tanks that comprise a small portion of the Militarium. Although a pale facsimile of Her might and glory, they are the most punishing pieces of machinery on the battlefield. Furthering the grants to designers will only further the purest form of battle worship that the Empire can follow."
  SOL_She_Who_Raises_the_Sun:0 "She Who Raises the Sun"
  #SOL_She_Who_Raises_the_Sun_desc:0 "Without her Sun, the world would be shrouded in eternal darkness. Without her Sun, there would be no life. The God-Empress is the life-giver, the protector, the Empire itself - She Who Raises the Sun."
  SOL_She_Who_Raises_the_Sun_desc:0 "Like the Sun itself, the God-Empress provides life, protection, and healing to all of her faithful. Without Her, the world would be plunged into the eternal darkness of Chaos and Disharmony. Without Her, all that is good and perfect would shrivel away. She is the Day Star. She is Harmony. She is the Empire itself: She is She Who Raises the Sun!"

  ###Empress Mother###
  SOL_empress_mother:0 "Service of Self"
  #SOL_empress_mother_desc:0 "Ponies are like foals, in need of a wise, yet stern parent. It is the duty of the Empress to be a mother to all her subjects. May she watch over us."
  SOL_empress_mother_desc:0 "There is little that the a pony can do to come close to the wonder of the Empress. She is above us. Her needs are her own. What else can we do but obey her and ensure her every need is met? Only through obeying her every command can we hope to be protected from the chaos in the world."
  SOL_harmonys_exemplar:0 "Harmony's Exemplar"
  SOL_harmonys_exemplar_desc:0 "The Empress is the epitome of a pony who guides through Harmony and Order. Only through her work have we survived for so long, with dangers around us at every turn. If we are to hope to continue to thrive, we must follow her example to the letter. Only then can we achieve unity."
  SOL_Imperial_Corporation_Council:0 "Imperial Corporation Council"
  #SOL_Imperial_Corporation_Council_desc:0 "Private enterprises too need guidance, so that may support the Empire in their endeavours. Fortunately, we can make that a mutually beneficial relationship."
  SOL_Imperial_Corporation_Council_desc:0 "Like ponies, private companies and businesses also require correction and oversight, lest they threaten the safety of Harmony and the Empress. In a world where everycreature is against us, it would be unwise to not ensure that she has the highest quality and most durable industry, so that her armies remain unbeatable."
  SOL_industrial_hoof:0 "Firm Hoof of Industry"
  SOL_industrial_hoof_desc:0 "A laissez faire economic system has dominated [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] policy for over a hundred years. Where has that led? Its only fruit is an unprepared nation and a soft populace. It has had its time, and now the Empress will ensure that every need is met and every want filled. Only then will we have prosperity."
  SOL_world_opportunity:0 "A World of Opportunity"
  SOL_world_opportunity_desc:0 "The land of Equestria has laid dormant for centuries, when it could have taken an active role in spreading Harmony and Order throughout the world. Nations yearn for stability. As so many are without proper leadership, the Empress must guide them, too, like she does us. When everycreature lives in unity, then will her job be done."
  SOL_land_of_subjects:0 "Lands of Subjects"
  SOL_land_of_subjects_desc:0 "Across the world, there are nations that could stand for a new outlook upon life. Corrupted governments. Famines. Wars. Societal divides. None are like us. None have the Empress as their head. They must be guided to Harmony, like she has with us. Collaborating with like-minded creatures will stabilize both their realm and our own, lest the Empress overburden herself with guiding them into Order."
  SOL_bed_companies:0 "Court the Companies"
  SOL_bed_companies_desc:0 "While the Imperial Corporation Council provides overarching principles for companies, they allow some freedom. However, there are a number of corporations which would be best served by completely dedicating themselves to the Empress's wills. Some kickbacks and promises of tax breaks should be enough to get them in line and working for her entirely."
  SOL_ponys_project:0 "Projects of a Pony's Desire"
  SOL_ponys_project_desc:0 "What else can be expressed about the granduer of the Empress? Words alone cannot praise her enough. Creation of a new government office, dedicated to erecting monuments to her across the Empire, will surely do wonders for ponies' morale. What better way to show her superiority than to improve what was considered perfect already?"
  SOL_Maternal_Guidiance:0 "Too Foolish to Learn"
  #SOL_Maternal_Guidiance_desc:0 "The guiding hoof of the Empress Mother shall illuminate the path ahead for her children and the Empire. Those who deviate will soon find themselves in the dark and cold."
  SOL_Maternal_Guidiance_desc:0 "Ponies are simple creatures. Unlike an alicorn, which can think far into the future, draw upon memories long past, or master a skill within short order, they are nothing but foals. Like foals, they need guidance. Over time, correction must be applied, too. The Empress, like a mother, shall be that light for them. All her foals must obey."
  SOL_empresss_bits:0 "All Bits are the Empress's"
  SOL_empresss_bits_desc:0 "Were it not for the Empress, there would be no economy. As proven by the laws implemented by the Corporation Council, she is ultimately the controller of every economic decision, and thereby, all wealth that is given to ponies comes through her. It would be trivial to justify shuttering companies that are failing or going astray. After all, they are hers already."
  SOL_innovative_corpo_grant:0 "Innovative Corporation Grant"
  SOL_innovative_corpo_grant_desc:0 "There are many companies within [ROOT.GetNameDef] whose potential was ignored under the old regime. If Harmony and the Empress are to remain at the forefront of the world stage, we must encourage that these shunned corporations bring their unique views to the light. Some promises of bits for technology that pleases the Empress will be a good start."
  SOL_peace_through_war:0 "Peace through War"
  SOL_peace_through_war_desc:0 "It is an irony that the only way to achieve peace is to forcibly ensure there is no war. Across the globe, the nations of the world claim they want nothing but peace, but then vie with each other over the most inane things. While the Empress is above this, it is also clear that she must guide the world to peace. Whether they agree with her or not."
  SOL_Imperial_Investigative_Service:0 "Imperial Investigative Service"
  #SOL_Imperial_Investigative_Service_desc:0 "Establishing a proper intelligence agency will allow the Empire to keep tabs on its enemies - away and at home. Dissidents cannot be allowed to prosper and disturb our Harmony, they shall be rooted out."
  SOL_Imperial_Investigative_Service_desc:0 "S.M.I.L.E. served its purpose but it was sympathetic to the soft-minded foals who wished to see us roll over and play dead when war threatened. In its place, the IIS will strive to protect the Empress from her enemies, within and without. There are still many that cling to the old ways, and they must not be allowed to thrive, after all."
  SOL_imperial_betters:0 "An Empire of Betters"
  SOL_imperial_betters_desc:0 "Although other nations may eventually bow to the Empress, they cannot consider themselves equals with us. Ponykind is above all and the Empress is the pinnacle of it. While there are still nations that are beneath us, it is best they be reminded of their place."
  SOL_Harmony_through_Order:0 "Harmony Through Order"
  #SOL_Harmony_through_Order_desc:0 "The purest form of Harmony is Order - only when everypony is at the right place, doing the right thing, thinking the right thoughts - only then Discord and Chaos give way to Harmony."
  SOL_Harmony_through_Order_desc:0 "Order and Unity are the peak of what Harmony seeks to achieve. As the Empress is the beacon of this Order, everypony is only in Order when they think her thoughts, obey her laws, and accept her guidance. To step outside of this unspoken boundary is what gives rise to Chaos, and any who support Chaos is an enemy of everypony."
  SOL_sole_alicorn:0 "The Sole Alicorn"
  SOL_sole_alicorn_desc:0 "Since the time immemorial, the Empress has been the only pony who has cared for us. She was the one who stopped Discord, she was the one who silenced Sombra. But over time, ponies claimed that she was helped. They seek nothing but to sow Chaos in the Empire. No matter what these Luna sympathizers may say, only the Empress can save us. No other alicorn matters."
  SOL_ultimate_leader:0 "The Ultimate Leader"
  SOL_ultimate_leader_desc:0 "Just as she is the exemplar of Harmony, so, too, is the Empress the perfect military commander. While armies may still make their own decisions, they will ultimately answer to her, and any order she gives contrary to them is final and unquestionable. After all, the being who can level battlefields with her magic alone surely knows what's best for her soldiers."
  SOL_magical_aggression:0 "Encourage Magical Aggression"
  SOL_magical_aggression_desc:0 "In the past, magic was used by unicorns for show, healing, and occasionally protection. Passivity has been bred into them for generations. Occasionally, what was considered aberrant behavior manifested as a leaning toward offensive magic. This must be encouraged for all unicorns, for only then will they be able to defend Harmony like the Empress."
  SOL_loyals_boon:0 "The Loyals' Boon"
  SOL_loyals_boon_desc:0 "Since her ascension, there have been a small number of ponies that have followed the Empress without question. They were once overlooked in the old regime, but that does not mean that the Empress will do so now. Like obedient foals, they shall be rewarded with responsibility. From there, their loyalty will shine all the brighter."
  SOL_Firm_but_Fair:0 "Firm but Fair"
  #SOL_Firm_but_Fair_desc:0 "Punish misbehaviour, reward obedience. Such is the role of a Mother - and that is what the Empress will do. The rules are very clear in our new society."
  SOL_Firm_but_Fair_desc:0 "For society to function and for Order to be achieved, ponies must live in Harmony. Laws exist for a reason. Those who break them are punished. Although this may seem a simple concept, it is still a fact that there are those who do not wish to follow the Empress's rules, which only brings more strife to the Empire. These criminals will be corrected, for such is the role of the supreme pony."
  SOL_train_in_excellence:0 "Train in Excellence"
  SOL_train_in_excellence_desc:0 "Although none can hope to achieve the level of perfection that the Empress commands, there is no reason that it cannot be emulated. As our ponies seek to become like her, they will raise the bar of society, dragging those who wish to be complacent along with them. Yet at every turn, they must recall that they cannot surpass her, for there is only one Empress, and she is Harmony achieved."
  SOL_nopony_greater:0 "Nopony can be Greater"
  SOL_nopony_greater_desc:0 "As there is no hope for anypony to reach the level of perfection that the Empress commands, there is little sense in attempting to strive to mimic her. Instead, ponies must be content in the knowledge they have a flawless Empress, who will guide and correct them for their entire lives. In that security, they can labor knowing that she will make sure their efforts aren't in vain and that Harmony is preserved."
  SOL_Empress_knows_Best:0 "Empress Knows Best"
  #SOL_Empress_knows_Best_desc:0 "A child does not know what is best for them - the Empress Mother will take care of them - as only she is fit to rule. To question the Empress would be unwise."
  SOL_Empress_knows_Best_desc:0 "Her ways are not our ways. Her thoughts are not our thoughts. Like a foal who is too naive and inexperienced to know what is best for them, we are also simple in comparison to her. Our role is to follow. Hers is to lead. Questioning this order would be most foalish."

  ###Empress Protector###
  SOL_empress_protector:0 "Hero of the Ponies"
  #SOL_empress_protector_desc:0 "The ponies, and other beings, need protection from harm and disorder - only in this way we can uphold Harmony. The Sun is a loving, nurturing protector. She watches over us all."
  SOL_empress_protector_desc:0 "The ponies of Equestria are meant to be guarded and protected. Princess Celestia knew this well, and it slowly gnawed at her as she was too constrained by her cabinet and her morals to do everything necessary. The Empress has transcended these issues, and will protect us from all harm, whether we see it for our good or not."
  SOL_law_of_iron:0 "A Law of Iron"
  SOL_law_of_iron_desc:0 "Weakness was what led to Equestria's almost complete collapse, and were it not for the grit of Daybreaker and her enlightnement, it would have surely fallen. Ponies are too willing to roll over to threats. They are soft. Even the sentences that criminals are given are light. That must change if ponies are to be kept safe, with punishments befitting the transgressions."
  SOL_required_productivity:0 "Required Productivity"
  SOL_required_productivity_desc:0 "Red Tape was almost glorified in the former government, where "procedure" and "processes" ruled instead of action and determination. Although there must still be Order within the government, there must also be consistent progress. Any and all laws, meetings, and conferences must actually ACCOMPLISH something. If it is simply to shoot hot air, then it is not worth having at all."
  SOL_imperial_oversight_board:0 "Imperial Oversight Board"
  SOL_imperial_oversight_board_desc:0 "One of the most basic aspects of a country is a functioning economy and infrastructure. Although there were government offices in the old Equestria meant to regulate these, they took a hooves-off approach. This has led to only certain areas of nation to being developed, and others have been left to dry. Creation of a board, who will direct through fines when areas are ignored will correct this error."
  SOL_imperial_bureaucracy:0 "Imperial Bureaucracy"
  #SOL_imperial_bureaucracy_desc:0 "A well-functioning bureaucracy is necessary for a well-functioning state. We shall not repeat the mistakes of the old Equestria, where red tape chronically obstructed any real reform until it was too late."
  SOL_imperial_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The Empress is not the state. There are numerous underlings who keep the gears of the government running while she concerns herself with grand ideas and protecting everypony from others and themselves. For a well-functionig state, everything must fall into place, like cogs in giant clock. Red tape will be minimal. When the Empress says "go," the Empire will follow. Wholeheartedly."
  SOL_defence_of_empire_act:0 "Defense of the Empire Act"
  #SOL_defence_of_empire_act_desc:0 "It is time to formally legalise the measures to protect and defend the citizens and the Empire. This act will give broad powers to the military, law enforcement and the Imperial Government."
  SOL_defence_of_empire_act_desc:0 "Although it was de facto, it is proper that the Empress formally be empowered by the government. Through her own Defense of the Empire Act, she will be given broad jurisdiction to control [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] society. Likewise, it will be at her discretion what powers the military, law enforcement, and civilian government will have, with a right to withdraw them at any time. Only she knows what is best for everypony."
  SOL_expand_imperial_arsenals:0 "Expand Imperial Arsenals"
  SOL_expand_imperial_arsenals_desc:0 "Although there are a few primary weapons manufactuers in the Empire, there are many smaller ones that supply regional garrisons and stock their armories. Some of these have made interesting variants of standard [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] weaponry, and providing them with further funding could lead to better defenses against dangers to ponies. All would be needed are a few volunteers."
  SOL_government_of_one:0 "Government of One"
  SOL_government_of_one_desc:0 "Much has been accomplished since Daybreaker became empress, but the government still has too much inertia stalling its reformation. With this becoming obvious, voices have proposed that the Empress be vested further powers. The nobles and lower chambers will be little more than formalities, as the Empress may pass any law she wishes and deems fit, as she benevolently rules over us forever."
  SOL_honest_cabinet:0 "An Honest Cabinet"
  SOL_honest_cabinet_desc:0 "A mistake of the old Equestria was that the former privy council was a mix of honest loyalists, sycophants, and ambitious parasites seeking to elevate themselves. However, as much as the Empress is wise, a single pony may make mistakes, and there are numerous, learned ponies who can aid her. This cabinet shall be hoofpicked, so ensure that she hears what she needs to hear, untainted by bias and selfishness."
  SOL_forgiveness_available:0 "Forgiveness is Available"
  SOL_forgiveness_available_desc:0 "Despite every lie, insult, and pony inspired by their rebellion, the Empress has made clear that the Element Bearers are to be unharmed. As she is nothing but a merciful empress, she has given them a choice of remaining in their confinement, or they can repent of their actions and seek forgiveness for the trouble they caused. This will no doubt cause a stir, but such is the price of exonerating the heroes of Equus."
  SOL_legion_of_labor:0 "Legion of Labor"
  #SOL_legion_of_labor_desc:0 "A group of patriots has promoted the idea of an Empire-sponsored work organisation, providing the jobless with purpose and pay, while working for the betterment of the Empire."
  SOL_legion_of_labor_desc:0 "There are still tens of thousands of ponies who are jobless and suffering or who have languished in prison for minor crimes. Both of these groups must be given purpose, for there will be no excuse for laziness. In her wisdom, the Empress has decreed a new organization that will provide work for the dregs and benefiting [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] society as a whole. Conditions may be harsh, but it is better than destitution."
  SOL_walks_of_life:0 "All Walks of Life"
  SOL_walks_of_life_desc:0 "No matter from where a pony comes, they have as much capacity to serve the Empress and follow her lead in protecting Harmony and ponies as anypony else. At one point, there may have been prejudice against certain regions, such as the South or the jungled peninsula, but that no longer matters. Let everypony come. Only the merit of their skill shall determine if they will be useful."
  SOL_utilize_element_bearers:0 "Utilize the Element Bearers"
  SOL_utilize_element_bearers_desc:0 "While the Empress may have transcended the boundaries the old Harmony, there are still some who cling to the ideas of friendship and peace in times when both are scarce. Exemplifying these ideals, the Element Bearers have a unique connection with the Elements of Harmony, which have proven frequently useful. Convincing them to aid the Empress will take time, but the Elements' power will be worth it."
  SOL_reclaim_elements_mantle:0 "Reclaim Harmony's Mantle"
  SOL_reclaim_elements_mantle_desc:0 "Long ago, the Empress bore the weight of all six Elements of Harmony. When she finally used them to banish Nightmare Moon, she relinquished their control, laying them dormant for a millennium. While she has been rejected by the artifacts, their location is known. Ponies require hope. Falsely promising that the power of the Elements now protects everypony will further ponies' trust."
  SOL_Strong_Imperial_Government:0 "Strong Imperial Government"
  #SOL_Strong_Imperial_Government_desc:0 "The Empress is, for all her might and glory, only a one pony. Therefore, she will need loyal and capable ministers, advisors and officials, so that her word may be accurately implemented even at the lowest levels of the society."
  SOL_Strong_Imperial_Government_desc:0 "While extensive power has been left in the hooves of the Empress, she cannot be everywhere. If she is to ensure that her ponies are guarded while she's preoccupied, the government must be vetted and delegated. Trusting those closest to her and granting them authority to act on her behalf is necessary. Only when her decrees are accurately passed down to the lowest levels of society can there be Order."
  SOL_ponykinds_savior:0 "Savior of Ponykind"
  SOL_ponykinds_savior_desc:0 "Only the Empress knows what must be done. Were it not for her sacrifices, ponykind could very well have entered a new dark age of oppression. While she is no goddess, she is yet our shield, our defender. On the battlefield, her words are absolute. When a pony is ordered to jump, they will jump. When ordered to die to save dozens, they will die. Only when there is complete obedience to her will ponykind be saved."
  SOL_ultimate_sacrifice:0 "Require Ultimate Sacrifices"
  SOL_ultimate_sacrifice_desc:0 "If peace could be won with words, it would no doubt be the first thing the Empress would do. But there are unreasonable tyrants and warmongers everywhere. While it is painful when a parent learns of a child's death, it is something that must be asked of our ponies. More must be brought to the front lines and perish for others' security. If safety demands the blood of millions, very well. Ponykind must prevail."
  SOL_magics_heart:0 "Magic's Heart"
  SOL_magics_heart_desc:0 "There remain many mysteries of magic to be uncovered. At the forefront of these mages studying the unknown is the Empress's own Lady Inquisitor, Sunrise Sparkle, the Element of Magic herself. Despite setbacks, lack of resources, and missing subjects, she is conident that there will be a breakthrough soon. All that's requried is a bit more funding, and a couple of overlooked requests."
  SOL_encourage_tattling:0 "Encourage Tattling"
  SOL_encourage_tattling_desc:0 "Society can only be truly safe is if everypony knows their actions are being recorded. Although the Empress knows much, she cannot see everything, which means that there are still some within our lands who believe that her laws don't apply. This shall not stand. Henceforth, everypony must inform law enforcement of even the slightest anti-Harmony actions. Fear of punishment will keep them in line."
  SOL_not_own_mistress:0 "Not Their Own Mistress"
  SOL_not_own_mistress_desc:0 "If allowed to live freely, ponies have shown that they will work against their own self-interests. When the world threatens them, they welcome those dangers in, hoping to befriend it. When money is tight, they will give to the point of privation, before thinking of their own families. To prevent this, further laws must be given, more rules must be implemented. Only the Empress knows what is best for their safety."
  SOL_free_minds:0 "Free Minds"
  SOL_free_minds_desc:0 "As ponies living within the guard rails that the Empress has decreed, our citizens have freer will than anycreature else in the world. Our Empress protects each one who obeys her, but their plans are their own. That has limits, however. So long as they remain within her laws will they truly have freedom, no matter what naysayers claim. Those that flout her will be punished according to their criems."
  SOL_help_themselves:0 "Help Those that Help Themselves"
  SOL_help_themselves_desc:0 "There are too many ponies in the Empire to properly aid all beyond extremely general programs. Many remain destitute, despite the Legion of Labor's efforts. However, these ponies must do all that they can to improve themselves, like the Empress, who ascended beyond her limited views to see the world as it was. When they are perfectly helpless, then will we provide what is necessary for survival."
  SOL_Protect_the_Weak:0 "Protect the Weak"
  #SOL_Protect_the_Weak_desc:0 "While defending from the threats both foreign and domestic, we need not forget about those who cannot provide for themselves. The warm and gentle Sun will make sure that the vulnerable can live with dignity."
  SOL_Protect_the_Weak_desc:0 "In the struggle for survival, it may be lost that there are many within the Empire that, no matter the support, cannot provide for themselves. The Legion of Labor Board only covers able-bodied ponies, not those who cannot perform any kind of work. However, the Empress is warm and gentle, and will never forget them. Provisions for the vulnerable will ensure that they will always live in dignity."
  SOL_Freedom_from_Fear:0 "Freedom from Fear"
  #SOL_Freedom_from_Fear_desc:0 "Under the guidance of the Sun, only the guilty have to fear. The innocent may sleep soundly, knowing that the Empress protects them - all the time."
  SOL_Freedom_from_Fear_desc:0 "Every decree from the Empress is for our benefit. While there are those who do not see it, they are a minority, and most can sleep soundly, knowing that their government is able to shield them from danger and never stops watching. In the Empress's world, only the guilty have anything to fear. In her soft and healing light, the innocent can live in peace and security, always listening to their superior."

  ###Military###
  SOL_modernize_relic:0 "Modernize the Relic"
  SOL_modernize_relic_desc:0 "The Imperial Military is still a holdover from the time before the Empress ascended. Although it has served us well, the cruft is obvious, and there are many within who still cling to the mistakes of the past. Like the rest of society, there must be a complete and utter reorganization for there to be an effective defense force for the Empire."

  ###Army###
  SOL_establish_solaris_militarium:0 "Establish the Solaris Militarium"
  SOL_establish_solaris_militarium_desc:0 "Despite the reforms and forced progress that the Equestrian Army went through, it was kicking and screaming the entire way. It has accomplished what it needed to be, but it must be taken to pasture and a new, streamlined entity must take its place. Likewise, it must reflect the strength and beauty of the Empress, and each soldier in it will embody her will until their last breath."
  SOL_inspect_officers:0 "Inspections of the Officers"
  SOL_inspect_officers_desc:0 "When the Equestrian Army finally broke out of its slow decay, there was a wide and indiscriminate recruitment and training program for many commissioned officers to fill obvious gaps. That led to the insubordination that plagued it when the Empress first ascended. Although that threat has been dealt with, there are still many who have rather unwise relationships. They shall be cut free. Permanently."
  SOL_encourage_troops:0 ""Encouragement" of the Troops"
  SOL_encourage_troops_desc:0 "When conscription was implemented within Equestria, there was no thought of loyalty beyond protecting the nation. There are many ponies who will happily die for whomever orders them to, but there are others who have become conscientious objectors while yet others remain on the fence. Cleansing the pacifists should be enough of a reminder to those who remain unconvinced of their loyalties."
  SOL_break_out_blueprints:0 "Break out Blueprints"
  SOL_break_out_blueprints_desc:0 "The Equestrian High Command dawdled on adopting an armored corps until it was too late. While there were attempts at modernization once war came upon the land, it was not enough. However, that did not mean that ponies did not wish to innovate and bring contemporary warfare to Equus. Many companies had working prototoypes, so now it's time that our engineers finally take them for our benefit."
  SOL_rearrange_command:0 "An Imperial High Command"
  SOL_rearrange_command_desc:0 "Although the Equestrian Army was thoroughly revitalized whe push came to shove, there are still redundancies or unneeded positions within the command structure which add additional paperwork, headaches, and costs that could be avoided with a bit of dross purging, whether their loyalty is suspect or not."
  SOL_imperial_factory_tour:0 "Imperial Factory Tours"
  SOL_imperial_factory_tour_desc:0 "Before the Empress ascended, she had not seen a gun since the first smoothbores were brought back from Griffonia. Primarily, she allowed the high command of Equus to decide upon policy, and kept only an academic understanding of the tools used of her troops. However, her interest has renewed. Factory tours will provide opportunity to showcase new weaponry, and, hopefully get approval from her."
  SOL_motivate_engineers:0 "Motivations to the Non-Combatants"
  SOL_motivate_engineers_desc:0 "Tens of thousands of ponies work in roles within the Militarium to support it and our troops. Although they may not have a direct impact on combat, if they were to lose their desire to serve the Empress, it would eventually lead to a collapse of the military in general. To finish her tour of the Militarium, the Empress shall meet with some influential civilian employees and guarantee their loyalty."
  SOL_prevent_embarrassments:0 "Prevent Further Embarrassments"
  SOL_prevent_embarrassments_desc:0 "Thus far, some of the most prominent generals that have openly supported the previous regime have upheld their oaths. However, they are too beloved and too vital to simply dispose of if they betray us, no matter the evidence against them; yet they are also too much of a risk to allow an active role. Reassignment to desk jobs should keep them easy to watch and useless in fomenting dissent against the Empress."
  SOL_traitors_reward:0 "The Traitors' Reward"
  SOL_traitors_reward_desc:0 "The prominent generals who have been foolish enough to openly vocalize their displeasure with the Empress, no matter how beloved, are an active threat to Order and Harmony. The Empress shall not allow this.\n\n§ROnly the flame can cleanse their taint from the Militarium.§!"
  SOL_sun_shines:0 "The Sun Shines upon All"
  SOL_sun_shines_desc:0 "Despite their past, the outspoken generals who have voiced their concerns about the Empress's new orders regarding the Militarium are ponies like any other. They can be corrected and guided, and their skills are invaluable, especially in this time of transition to a proper fighting force. Pardons will be issued to them, and they shall be given a chance like the rest of her subjects."
  SOL_new_officers:0 "New Blood"
  #SOL_new_officers_desc:0 "We have no shortage of ambitious, young or overlooked officers. While their potential might have been wasted under the old regime, the Empire will most certainly make good use of their skills."
  SOL_new_officers_desc:0 "With the necessary revisions complete, there is opportunity for many officers, recruits, or conscripts to earn higher positions within the Militarium. After all, we do not lack ponies with ambition or motivation, and while those considered ruthless may have been overlooked by the Equestrian Army, we do not hold to such antiquated beliefs."
  SOL_safest_methods:0 "The Safest Methods"
  SOL_safest_methods_desc:0 "Although much of the old regime's tactics are outdated, their heart of preserving the lives of ponies is something that we cannot discard. Extensive networks of trenches and efficient supply lines, along with superior planning, will ensure that the day is won with the fewest losses possible."
  SOL_byzantine_supply:0 "Optimizing Supply Lines"
  SOL_byzantine_supply_desc:0 "When ponies are at the ends of the Empire, protecting the Empress and others, the last thing on their mind is when they will run out of food or ammunition. Through a series of checks, counter-measures, and balances, as well as a liberal application of new form requests and tracking, there may be more work involved in quartermastering, but not a single soldier will go without once the reforms are in place."
  SOL_digging_earth:0 "Digging to the Earth"
  SOL_digging_earth_desc:0 "Static warfare has been a hallmark of previous generations, but modern times have required updated tactics. Trenches, while still indispensable, must be adapted, too. Newer technologies allow for more rapid creation of systems, and through a bit of liberal application of explosive magic, expanded with relative ease, no matter the pressure from the enemy."
  SOL_combined_defenses:0 "Combined Defenses"
  SOL_combined_defenses_desc:0 "With many nations leaning into mobile, tank warfare, the necessity to respond to emerging breaches in the front line requires a creation of various vanguards that can respond to enemy spearheads in short order and deal with them with extreme prejudice."
  SOL_efficient_clearing:0 "Efficient Trench Clearing"
  SOL_efficient_clearing_desc:0 "When infantry manages to assault and invade the trenches of opposing forces, it can still be a suicidal effort, as the enemy is both prepared and desperate to fend off an attack. Statistics indicate that after crossing "No Mare's Land" a soldier is most likely to perish in the clearing of enemy trenches. Recent advances in infernal warfare, though, promises to cauterize the enemy before they can even resist."
  SOL_generational_leaps:0 "Generational Leaps"
  SOL_generational_leaps_desc:0 "Warfare is a constantly shifting target. While planning has always remained indispensable, it has become clear that even the best laid opeartions frequently run into tactical snares when theory meets practicality. Refinements to the Imperial High Command's doctrines will require further wargaming, as well as multiple scenarios for each phase of an operation, to ensure the greatest chance of success."
  SOL_communication_key:0 "Communication is Key"
  SOL_communication_key_desc:0 "An army without the ability to communicate is one that will perish without firing a shot. Although the use of message scribes has been a tradition of the Equestrian and later Imperial military for generations, they are less efficient and more costly to replace than a properly designed radio. Further pushing for the modernization of communications between armies will further aid our forces' survival."
  SOL_strike_iron:0 "Strike a Hot Iron"
  SOL_strike_iron_desc:0 "Sometimes it is almost impossible for artillery or hoof infantry to fill in a breach within the lines of battle. Whether the enemy begins to pour in faster than reinforcements can arrive, or the terrain is unsuitable for standard movement, the result is the same. Completely motorizing our response groups will allow for comparitively instant reactions and also allow for miniature spearhads on the offense, as well."
  SOL_hoof_of_empress:0 "The Hoof of the Empress"
  SOL_hoof_of_empress_desc:0 "Artillery has been a mainstay of the battlefield for generations, but with modern advancements, it can act as the primary swing of any army's forces. In its own way, overwhelming an enemy with unending fire has beauty to it. Like the Empress, its impact is felt far and wide. Designing our military around ideals of complete destruction will quickly win us wars."
  SOL_showering_battlefield:0 "Showering the Battlefield"
  SOL_showering_battlefield_desc:0 "Why should we waste soldiers' lives when they can be put to use elsewhere? Our empire is the most industrially and militarily capable nation on Equus, yet we choose to spend effort on killing servants of the Empress instead of utilizing our strengths. We can merely build bigger and better cannons, and saturate an entire battlefield in shells. We shall drown our enemies in gunpowder and lead!"
  SOL_combined_assaults:0 "Combined Assaults"
  SOL_combined_assaults_desc:0 "Enemy emplacements may sometimes be too heavily fortified for a standard infantry attack, and when out of range of our artillery or in areas incompatible with tanks, a true danger to the success of a mission. Through massed charges combined with more manueverable, armored vehicles, assaults against strongholds can still hope to overcome the enemy, regardless of their situation."
  SOL_holy_napalm_applications:0 "Holy Napalm Application"
  SOL_holy_napalm_applications_desc:0 "Fire is the purest of all weapons, as it ignores guilt and never plays favorites. As She Who Raises the Sun, the Empress uses this truth to separate the loyal and the disloyal, the sheep from the wolves. However, it is not the only use. The battlefield is filled with threats to the Empress, and compounds such as "napalm" provide the perfect method of delivery of some of her holy justice!"
  SOL_mundane_magic:0 "Magic in Mundane Form"
  SOL_mundane_magic_desc:0 "As our enemies' efforts to overwhelm us with armor continue, we must look to apply further ways of piercing even their toughest shells. Although many do not see it as something glamorous or enticing, the work of ensuring our troops can crack the armored corps of any foe is a necessary, if dull, task that shall be rewarded by the lives saved and an Empress shielded."
  SOL_war_games:0 "War Games"
  SOL_war_games_desc:0 "There are always new tactics that our enemies employ that may catch us off guard. While we cannot always predict them, we can always be prepared for them, and by initiating a constant series of war games in which the Imperial High Command participates, we will have practical experience in refining our own responses to the enemy, and see where we fall short, or where we can exploit a weakness of our foes."
  SOL_rapid_reloads:0 "Rapid Reloading Crews"
  SOL_rapid_reloads_desc:0 "The greatest issue with our cannons are simply that they fire too slowly. Although we can throw more ponies at the problem, the problem is inherent in the designs. Numerous measures for safety can get in the way of launching more judgement upon the enemy, so simply disposing of them will improve the rate of which our crews can fire. What's a lost limb compared to destroying a company of soldiesr?"
  SOL_invincible_spotlights:0 "Range to the Heavens"
  SOL_invincible_spotlights_desc:0 "There is nothing on the battlefield that can't be silenced by the deafening thunder of the Empress's cannons. While the enemy may try and hide, as techniques with artillery mature, we will be able to level stretches that were thought untouchable. Some of these applications to our cannon's barrels may also be useful for our anti-air defenses, so that we may reach fliers that could one time assault us with impunity."
  SOL_imperial_workhorses:0 "Workhorses of the Empire"
  SOL_imperial_workhorses_desc:0 "Ponies were created for the Empress, not the inverse. While Daybreaker leads us, we are also her faithful and unqestioning servants. Equestria saw the military as more than the tool it was and spent needless resources on safety. What is a servant without sacrifice? We shall overwhelm the enemy with sheer numbers, as it is the only way we can show our love for the God-Empress."
  SOL_accept_truth:0 "Accepting the Truth"
  SOL_accept_truth_desc:0 "As much as our generals still yearn for a day when large-scale infantry combat would decide wars in a single battle, reality has passed them by. Nations across the globe are adopting an armored corps which can run circles around infantry or artillery. If we are to keep up, we must further our own tank initiatives, so that we can overwhelm the enemy with unstoppable machines of the God-Empress's justice!"
  SOL_mobile_cannons:0 "Mobile Cannons"
  SOL_mobile_cannons_desc:0 "A weakness of artillery is its lack of durability, but there are other ways of propelling heavy cannons between locations on the battlefield. The tank chassis is a perfect bed for adapting and using the heaviest guns to which we have access, and by further improving the armor and drivetrain of specific models, we could one day achieve a fully mobile military, with little in the way of infantry need."
  SOL_speedy_fields:0 "Speed on the Field"
  SOL_speedy_fields_desc:0 "Our current motorization is adequate, but there are always places in which to improve. Behind the lines, supplies could arrive sooner, wounded soldiers delivered for healing faster, and information provided quicker, that demands we innovate on our vehicles. On the front, rapid reponses can never be hurt by an even speedier engine, and it will allow us to quickly fill gaps where needed."
  SOL_operational_art:0 "Operational Art"
  SOL_operational_art_desc:0 "Every plan has weaknesses, but it is a matter of seeing our own and discovering our enemy's that we can exploit them. On all levels of combat, from the simple skirmish to the grand campaign, we will combine our tactics and practical knowledge to determine the flaws in an enemy's attack, and counter like a knife through hot butter straight into their midst to destroy them utterly."
  SOL_streamlined_firearms:0 "Streamlined Firearms"
  SOL_streamlined_firearms_desc:0 "A firearm is a simple thing, at least to those who do not have to create them. Despite performing a basic task: shooting things, a gun is a marvel of engineering with various specialized parts that are required to function. However, many of these parts are superfluous, only allowing for slightly better comfort or functionality. Through their elimination, we shall satisfy the hunger of our ever-growing army."
  SOL_melt_shroud:0 "Melting the Shroud"
  SOL_melt_shroud_desc:0 "The Holy Flame is the symbol and might of the God-Empress herself. Since we have been baptized in her fire, we have sought ways to deliver the cleansing inferno to our enemies, that their sin may be burned like dross. While many soldiers may wish to personally deliver her flame in battle, mounting throwers to tanks will improve both their strength and durability, that we may immolate all that have been corrupted."
  SOL_mighty_hoofs:0 "Mighty Hoofs"
  SOL_mighty_hoofs_desc:0 "One of the longest standing issues within the former Equestrian military was a gap in enemy lines could be exploited. Although there were proponents of tank warfare, they were routinely marginalized. Today, though, they are no longer ignored, and the creation of a true force focused on armored warfare shall be created. Our tanks will be unmatched, and punch through any line they face!"
  SOL_only_statistics:0 "Only Statistics"
  SOL_only_statistics_desc:0 "The ponies of the God-Empress are numerous, and they are little more than tools to spread her glory across the world. Whether we achieve victory with a thousand losses or one hundred thousand, it is inconsequential in the grand vision of Daybreaker. If we throw enough bodies at a problem, we will always succeed. There will be more to replace them."
  SOL_reduced_standards:0 "Reduced Standards"
  SOL_reduced_standards_desc:0 "A soldier is meant to kill. A gun is meant to facilitate those requirements. It is a simple arrangement. Over time, that simplicity has been marred by various additional requirements, either in the gun itself or the manufacturing process, but these are pointless. Does it matter if a firearm may lack a safety, if it means the soldier can fire sooner?"
  SOL_modernized_knights:0 "Modernized Knights"
  SOL_modernized_knights_desc:0 "In the centuries after Nightmare Moon was defeated, orders of ponies dedicated to virtues such as honor, humility, and generosity sprung up, and in times of war, could be called upon to serve the Empress with complete dedication. While the armored knight is antiquated, its concept in a heavily protected, mobile spearhead is not. Affixing our tanks to these ideals will lead to further victories upon the battlefield."
  SOL_mage_army:0 "An Army of Mages"
  #SOL_mage_army_desc:0 "Basing our doctrine on usage of magic will allow us to tap into the power of our mages, with devastating results for the enemy."
  SOL_mage_army_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] is filled with a race entirely dedicated to magic. Unicorns are plentiful and many are willing to serve the Empress in any capacity within the Militarium. Through harnessing the innate magic within both them and the other two races of ponies, we will gain an edge no other military could hope to achieve. Our mages' power will be unlimited!"
  SOL_mysterious_magic:0 "Mysteries of Magic"
  SOL_mysterious_magic_desc:0 "Ponies are a magical race, but that does not mean that everything that can be done with magic has been understood, or even discovered. We have many talented mages and scribes within [ROOT.GetNameDef], and it would be foalish to not utilize their talents. Further grants and test subjects will be given to our mages, that they may further our abilities in the arcane for war."
  SOL_evocation_schools:0 "Schools of Evocation"
  SOL_evocation_schools_desc:0 "There are many classes of spells, ranging from those that can dazzle and amaze, to forbidden spells that can raise the dead. One of the most prominent, especially with the ascension of the Empress, is evocation. Training all prospective unicorns in standard evocation rules will lead to ponies that channel little shards of the Empress's might themselves!"
  SOL_magitech_integration:0 "Magitech Integration"
  SOL_magitech_integration_desc:0 "Although they're not directly related, magic and mundane technology are inherently linked with each other, as one can support the other to shore up weaknesses. While the Magical Energy Weapon is a pinnacle of the mundane and arcane working in unison, we must further improve upon its platform, integrating components with magical energy to streamline our processes and drown our enemies with magic."
  SOL_magical_adaptations:0 "Magical Adaptations"
  SOL_magical_adaptations_desc:0 "For centuries, the standard military thinking involved earth ponies and pegasi. While magical, they did not count on unicorns for generalist work, rather specialist missions. With the advent of modern magical technology, that process must change, so that we can utilize the promises of magic to their fullest extent."
  SOL_next_gen_spells:0 "Next-Generation Spells"
  SOL_next_gen_spells_desc:0 "The crystals that power our magical weaponry are finicky and prone to issues with providing the power necessary to discharge spells down-range. Further refining the design of the crystal matrices used plus creating tailored spells for guns will only further increase the lethality of our troops on the battlefield."

  ###Navy###
  SOL_rebuild_admiralty:0 "Rebuild the Imperial Admiralty"
  SOL_rebuild_admiralty_desc:0 "Within the old Equestrian Navy, heritage meant more than actual skill. A number of nobles have clung to their positions as grand admirals, stifling innovation and the ability for qualified ponies to replace them. It is time they are shown the door, and those who have actually had combat experience be elevated to their circle instead that we may begin expanding the fleet."
  SOL_scraping_barrels:0 "Scraping the Barrels"
  SOL_scraping_barrels_desc:0 "Although we are not lacking for vessels thus far, we must keep in mind other countries' navies and how they could catch us off guard. Over the decades, a number of old models of ships have been mothballed and left rusting. Quick restorations of the hulls are possible, especially with magic, and we could fill any gaps in our squadrons while we construct newer designs."
  SOL_saltless_blood:0 "Salt-Free Blood"
  SOL_saltless_blood_desc:0 "With the cruft of the old grand admiralty removed, there are now gaps in the roster of those who can command our fleets. Thankfully, there is no shortage of able-minded ponies with the candor of youth that will invigorate our naval halls with fresh ideas and zealous devotion to Harmony."
  SOL_practical_needs:0 "Practical Needs"
  SOL_practical_needs_desc:0 "Regardless of where everypony stands within the Imperial Admiralty on naval doctrine, one thing is agreed upon. [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] is in desperate need of updated destroyer models. As time has gone on, it's become clear that these smallest vessels have much to provide, as they are flexible enough to guard coasts, fleets, or chase down other light ships. Maintaining their edge will ward our navy for years."
  SOL_strong_dissuasion:0 "A Strong Dissuasion"
  SOL_strong_dissuasion_desc:0 "While neither the largest or smallest ships, cruisers can hold their own for short periods of time against ships significantly heavier than them and can outgun any destroyers on the seas. While they cannot have the same presence as a battleship, they are easier to construct and generally are enough where a heavy gun is overkill. New models should be prioritized immediately."
  SOL_surrender_waves:0 "Surrendering the Waves"
  SOL_surrender_waves_desc:0 "In decades past, the dreadnought and later the battleship were the queen of the seas, but advancements in aviation and naval technology has given rise to the aircraft carrier. From afar, they can unleash their squadrons of planes and strike where even battleships cannot go. While they are in their infancy, they are the future and it would be best to adopt them while it gives us the advantage."
  SOL_crushing_sea:0 "Crushing the Sea"
  SOL_crushing_sea_desc:0 "In a decade, the aircraft carrier may be developed enough that they can challenge traditional ship warfare, but for the moment, the battleship is the queen of the waves. Continuing to base our tactics around large surface fleets with central flagships to intimidate or pound enemies into submission cannot steer us wrong. A carrier is useless if it at the bottom of the ocean, after all."
  SOL_mobile_airfields:0 "Mobile Airfields"
  SOL_mobile_airfields_desc:0 "Our current aircraft carriers are little more than repurposed dreadnoughts or cruisers with long decks strapped upon them. By designing from the ground up a hull that is based around planes, we can make them more efficient. They may lose some of their cabin space, but making the total deck space for planes larger will allow us to bring a small air base's worth of craft with us anywhere in the world."
  SOL_fillydelphia_rivalry:0 "Fillydelphian Rivalry"
  SOL_fillydelphia_rivalry_desc:0 "While Las Pegasus has been the primary shipyard that has constructed our ships, Fillydelphia and Manehattan also have capable infrastructure to provide for navy. They have mostly kept to civilian craft, and a small rivalry has sprung up between them. As Fillydelphia has had more experience with large ships, it is only natural to favor them for our carrier projects and leave Manehattan to their devices."
  SOL_semper_fi:0 "Semper Fi"
  SOL_semper_fi_desc:0 "With a revitalized navy, there comes a need for brave ponies that will serve on the fronts that the ships create when we must bring the fight for Harmony and Order to the other continents. While there have been ersatz marines in the past, it is time that we formalize the institution and recruit from the best of the navy so that we may conquer the beaches."
  SOL_expand_manehattan_dockyards:0 "Expand the Manehattan Dockyards"
  SOL_expand_manehattan_dockyards_desc:0 "Although it is much smaller than the Las Pegasus shipyards, Manehattan has a large and modern series of facilities for constructing ships. While it's remained civilian, it can easily be bought out and expanded to handle the needs of our growing navy. Some of the hulls laid can even be converted now into warships, saving both time, effort, and money."
  SOL_first_rates:0 "First-Rate Ships"
  SOL_first_rates_desc:0 "Among all the surface vessels, the battleship is the purest form of art. Massive, floating tools of destruction, these bear the heritage of the wooden warships of old. Nothing can challenge their guns and survive, but they can still be outpummeled or outmanuevered. Iterating on their designs to shore up these weaknesses will ensure we continue to terrorize any who wish to fight us at sea."
  SOL_birds_of_water:0 "Birds of the Water"
  SOL_birds_of_water_desc:0 "We may have all the carriers that we wish, but if we do not have the planes to fill them, our fleets will be useless. Although prototypes and early conversions of terrestrial aircraft have been utilized by our navies for some time, we must create true carrier-designed aircraft, and it will require extensive tweaking of our planes to do so."
  SOL_modern_sea:0 "The Modern Sea"
  SOL_modern_sea_desc:0 "We stand on the cusp of innovation in naval warfare. While other nations may still focus on the weapons of the past, we innovate toward a future where the battleship and battlecruiser are utterly pointless in one's arsenal. New breakthroughs in launching and storing our naval aircraft will lead to efficient utilization of our carriers, so that even our rivals will struggle to match us."
  SOL_grand_expeditions:0 "Grand Expeditions"
  SOL_grand_expeditions_desc:0 "To further the Empress's reach and ambitions, our forces will ultimately have to spread Harmony and Order to lands beyond Equus. Thus far, our military transports have mostly kept our coasts, thereby reducing the need for extensive redesigns. However, with a global spread of Order, we will need ships that can take us to the furthest reaches of the globe to enforce her will."
  SOL_floating_cities:0 "Floating Cities"
  SOL_floating_cities_desc:0 "As our experience increases in carrier warfare, our hulls have steadily increased in size to provide more room for crew and redundancy in systems, but our capacity has remained the same. There is little reason we cannot utilize these larger hulls for their true purpose: swarming the skies with fighters with which to deliver the Empress's justice."
  SOL_long_range_strikers:0 "Long Range Strikers"
  SOL_long_range_strikers_desc:0 "Our planet is much larger than Equus, and we will require our carriers to patrol and protect whatever territory the Empress claims as her own. Prototypes for carriers with retooled interiors and subsystems have shown promise for their improved engine power and fuel capacity. This does limit the number of planes they can hold, but that is a small price in extending the Empress's reach."
  SOL_roach_guards:0 "Roach Guards"
  SOL_roach_guards_desc:0 "The Admiralty has been approached by a rather odd proposition by one of our destroyer captains. As our navy expands, we will require numerous smaller vessesl to protect our capital ships. This concept, a "roach" light ship is novel, and while it may mean we lose many more, we will always have more to replace them. It may be unpopular among crews, but guarding our Empress comes above their comfort."
  SOL_magisteel_plating:0 "Magisteel Plating"
  SOL_magisteel_plating_desc:0 "For centuries, skilled smiths have bonded magic with various metals as they forged them to further increase the strenth of the armor. Normally this is too taxing to do on large ships, but some students in Fillydelphia have devised a way to use matrix crystals to store the magic and discharge them into the steel forging process. Implementing this will make our capital ships even more deadly against the enemy."
  SOL_imperial_dreadnoughts:0 "Imperial Dreadnoughts"
  SOL_imperial_dreadnoughts_desc:0 "Continued advancements in design permit the mounting of heavier armor and guns on our battleships than ever before. Crews protected by the thick plating and powerful cannons have nothing to fear from the enemy, as anything that comes up against one of our battleships will be destroyed! These beasts of the sea truly deserve the term of dreadnought, for dread is an anathema to their captains!"
  SOL_swarms_upon_sea:0 "Swarms upon the Sea"
  SOL_swarms_upon_sea_desc:0 "To truly rule the waves, we must control the skies above. When an enemy fleet is foalish enough to engage our navy, they will be drowned out in bombs and bullets, for our carriers will unleash entire wings of planes before they can react and leave them as nothing but scrap upon the bottom of the ocean!"
  SOL_old_guns:0 "The Old Guns"
  SOL_old_guns_desc:0 "While it may be seen as quaint or antiquated by some countries, there is little that can truly challenge the firepower of a battleship. We may now be challenged by carrier-based fleets or submarine wolfpacks, but we can simply burn them out with the firepower that a single battleship brings. They cannot hope to defeat us when we can pummel them into sunken wrecks!"
  SOL_adapt_tide:0 "Adapt with the Tide"
  SOL_adapt_tide_desc:0 "The landscape of naval combat has changed drastically from the turn of the millennium. No more are task forces designed around a single or pair of heavy battleships, but instead it is a mobile, long-range strike force that is comprised of a number of nimble screening ships and a few carriers. Although these seem weak, they can handle anything thrown at them with their versatility. The age of the battleship is over."
  SOL_steady_going:0 "Steady as She Goes"
  SOL_steady_going_desc:0 "Although naval warfare is continuing to evolve, the battleships are far from becoming obsolete. New advancements in armor and weapons continue to allow our mighty dreadnoughts to keep pace with nimbler, carrier-based strike forces. Wherever our battleships reside, they are unstoppable forces of nature that cannot be matched. The age of the battleship will not go down without a fight!"
  SOL_practical_reductions:0 "Practical Reductions"
  SOL_practical_reductions_desc:0 "A battleship is a fearsome creation that takes significant amounts of effort to bring to fruition. Many of the delays in building the weapons that the Empress requires are based around safety standards and redundant subsystems in case of failure. Recorded rates of said failures are negligible among our captains, so there is little reason to keep them. Cutting a few corners will benefit us all in the long run."
  SOL_sea_fortress:0 "A Fortress upon the Seas"
  SOL_sea_fortress_desc:0 "Although our battleships are grand, they are not worthy of one being given the honor of being the Empress's personal flagship. If it is to be worthy of her, it must be far larger, far more powerful, and far more imposing, than any ship we have yet conceived. It must be unsinkable and undefeatable. Plans have already been drawn up to create something magnificent, well into the future."
  SOL_sun_never_sets:0 "The Sun will Never Set"
  SOL_sun_never_sets_desc:0 "Our navy is a sight to behold, unmatched in its power and capable of reaching the very ends of the world to exact the Empress's retribution. As we spread Harmony to the world, furthered by our ships' unstoppable might, we will be able to truly say that the Sun will never cease its blessing and protection of the Empire!"

  ###Air Force###
  SOL_sky_domain:0 "Domain of the Sky"
  SOL_sky_domain_desc:0 "The need for an Imperial Airforce is becoming more apparent by the day. Equestria was content to have a few volunteer wings and to conscript the Wonderbolts where necessary, but to fend off our enemies, we require something far more professional. As one of the Empire's races can literally fly, it is only natural that we come to dominate the skies."
  SOL_abolish_wonderbolts:0 "Abolish the Wonderbolts"
  SOL_abolish_wonderbolts_desc:0 "The Wonderbolts have been outspoken supporters of the old regime and actively act against the interests of Order for which Daybreaker stands. Therefore, if they wish to poke the hornets' nest, they shall face the consequences. From this moment forth, they are no more, and a loyal, Solarist group shall take their place. The Solarbeams sounds appropriate."
  SOL_striking_battlefield:0 "Striking the Battlefield"
  SOL_striking_battlefield_desc:0 "With the Imperial Air Force appropriately cleansed, it now falls to reassess the doctrine of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. The old regime's general attitude to the role of the air was to maintain a clear sky, which as other benefits. Planes can be outfitted with heavy payloads to pummel the enemy troops, which has been popular in [CHN.GetNameDef]. It would only fit for us to implement something similar."
  SOL_punishing_world:0 "Punishing the World"
  SOL_punishing_world_desc:0 "We stand alone as the only light of Harmony and Order upon this world, and everycreature around us would desire nothing more than to stifle this flame before they are given enlightenment. Therefore, as they are all our enemies, we must strike them hard, fast, and far. We will strive to improve and perfect our long-range bombers that we may catch all who oppose us unaware!"
  SOL_durable_frames:0 "High Durability Frames"
  SOL_durable_frames_desc:0 "One of the greatest risk for our newly-created dive bombers is small arms fire. When enemy soldiers take notice, some will take flight, but others will shoot back. A stray bullet into the fuselage in a critical area could prove fatal, and we must improve our alloys and plating on our planes if we wish to have an acceptable level of attrition in combat."
  SOL_fear_tactics:0 "Fear Tactics"
  SOL_fear_tactics_desc:0 "There is nothing more frightening to a soldier than an unearthly sound right before their comrades are torn to shreds. Although it is incredibly simple, one of our test pilots suggested a solution to further the morale failure of enemy combatants while our planes are on dive bombing missions. Strap a couple of ram-air sirens onto the gear legs and watch as soldiers flee at their nightmare chasing them."
  SOL_sky_flexibility:0 "Flexibility in the Skies"
  SOL_sky_flexibility_desc:0 "One of the greatest strengths of our primary fighter forces is that the general body designs we have can be quickly adapted to different missions. This flexibility permits us to use them to take to any particular aerial doctrine, while also specializing them when necessary for mass production. Further iteration upon this general weapons bed will keep us responsive to any threats for years to come."
  SOL_streamline_expenses:0 "Streamlining Expenses"
  SOL_streamline_expenses_desc:0 "One of the greatest hurdles in maintaining a large bomber force is cost of replacement. Our bombers are complex, and fixing one is no easy task. Filling a hole left by one being shot down is even more taxing, due to stringent requirements and material costs. By sourcing alternate raw materials to use or by cutting safety inspections, we could fill our quotas easily. Just with maybe a few lemons that leave the factory."
  SOL_reinforced_bomb_struts:0 "Reinforced Bomb Struts"
  SOL_reinforced_bomb_struts_desc:0 "A dive bomber is only as effective as the payload it can carry. Our current generation of bomb-mounting hardware to our planes' wings is sorely lacking compared to nations such as [CHN.GetNameDef]. Through stronger, lighter weight alloys, we can mount larger and heavier bombs to our bombers and deliver even more retribution to our enemies."
  SOL_field_tests:0 "Field Tests"
  SOL_field_tests_desc:0 "Many of our advancements have been made thus far in the laboratory, and while theoretical knowledge is important, we can only get the best results through extensive lives tests. Additionally, it allows testing of impractictal experiments for a lab setting, such as how excessive g-forces affect a pilot. With the disbmandment of the Wonderbolts and arrest of old flight crews, we have no shortage of subjects."
  SOL_invisible_eyes:0 "Invisible Eyes"
  SOL_invisible_eyes_desc:0 "Understanding the battlefield is everything. While we can and shall continue to probing teams on the ground, they can only get a snippet of the situation on a front, and run greater risks of detection and capture. Developing high-powered, sensitive photographic equipment that can be mounted in plane bodies could provide us a useful leg up on intelligence during conflict."
  SOL_adequate_defense:0 "Adequate Defenses"
  SOL_adequate_defense_desc:0 "While our bombers themselves can fend off light attacks, they are sitting ducks compared to enemy interception craft. However, range becomes an issue for standard fighter escorts, which requires improving the maligned concept of a heavy fighter. They may still be less manueverable than other fighters, but they can keep pace with our bombers and much better protection than without."
  SOL_bat_vision:0 "Vision of the Bats"
  SOL_bat_vision_desc:0 "While most of our citizens may sleep at night, it is not always the case for our bomber pilots. Night-time bombing has become popular among the Imperial Airforce, as it reduces the risk to our bomber crews and can surprise enemies. However, just as it limits retaliation, so it also hinders our own attacks. Thestrals, while contemptible, have superior night vision. Mimicking that with magic will aid our crews extensively."
  SOL_mimic_pegasi:0 "Mimicry of Pegasi"
  SOL_mimic_pegasi_desc:0 "Pegasi are the nimblest fliers in the sky, and while a plane will never attain the manueverability of them, there are ways that we can tweak weight balance, adjust control surfaces, and strengthen the rigidity of frames that will allow our dive bombers to more closely copy them. They may be harder to control outside of a dive, but whilst in one, they will be nearly unshakeable."
  SOL_high_yield_explosives:0 "High-Yield Explosives"
  SOL_high_yield_explosives_desc:0 "Constructing larger bombs is one way to increase the damage that can be wrought by our dive bombers, but another way is by improving the power in the same size explosive. Traditional explosives, while effective, do hit a hard limit. However, little has been tested in the field of magical or magically-enhanced bombs. Feeding additional power through enchantment should be simple and deadly."
  SOL_hero_program:0 "Imperial Hero Program"
  SOL_hero_program_desc:0 "Many of the youth of [ROOT.GetNameDef] are obsessed with the tales of aces who dance among the clouds, protecting their ground-bound brethren and downing hundreds of enemy planes. While this is romanticization to the highest degree, society benefits from its unifying message. Furthering this through sending some of our aces to meet with civilians should lead to increased pilot recruitment."
  SOL_flying_castles:0 "Flying Castles"
  SOL_flying_castles_desc:0 "Although they may have escort, our bombers must still be able to fend for themselves. Dodging hits is ideal, but given their size, it is an almost impossible ask. Instead, we should lean into their unwieldiness and further reinforce the fuselage and wings, so that they can survive far more hits than they would otherwise, while they and their escorts retaliate against any who challenge them in the sky."
  SOL_holy_deliverance:0 "Imperial Flame Deliverance Systems"
  SOL_holy_deliverance_desc:0 "Napalm has become a common ordinance within our ground strike missions, as it has the useful property of being both deadly and a reflection of the Empress's justice. However, keeping it within bombs on the wings or in a small bays runs is dangerous. A radical new system has been prototyped. By keeping an internal tank and a small tube to eject the liquid, we can cover large battlefield with minimal risk."
  SOL_additional_prototypes:0 "Additional Prototoypes"
  SOL_additional_prototypes_desc:0 "Since we have convinced so many to trial various theoretical aircraft or design changes to models already in the field, we have begun to run out of vehicles for them to utilize! If we are to keep our quota of test subject churn up, we must allow even more radical changes or barely lab-tested alterations through. After all, that's what the guinea pigs are for, anyway."
  SOL_fire_from_sky:0 "Fire from the Skies"
  SOL_fire_from_sky_desc:0 "Although the humble explosive can devastate large tracts of land, there is nothing quite like the sight of flames borne on the wind administering justice against whatever it touches. We have already utilized firebomb campaigns in the past, but they could be more effective. By crafting more durable bombs carrying napalm, we can ensure that they spread the Empress's judgement far and wide."
  SOL_targeted_destruction:0 "Targeted Destruction"
  SOL_targeted_destruction_desc:0 "While our fighter-bombers may lack a true bomber's range, that does not make them entirely useless. Their versatility is a strength, since they can quickly focus on both mobile land and sea targets before switching to stationary structures. By refining our tactics around these pinpoint assaults, we can hit the enemy where it hurts the most, while leaving the rest for us to take and use for ourselves."
  SOL_modern_bombers:0 "Moderate Bomber Sizes"
  SOL_modern_bombers_desc:0 "There is a place for large, quad or even six-engined planes, but they are expensive, slow, and clumsy to fly. On extended range missions they are unrivaled, but medium-ranged or short-ranged bombing missions could be better suited to a middle ground. These tactical bombers have been largely ignored by our air force and the Empress, but that doesn't mean they cannot still have a place and rain her justice upon our foes."
  SOL_area_bombardment:0 "Area Bombardment"
  SOL_area_bombardment_desc:0 "There are few ways to be certain that something is truly destroyed unless the entire region in which it resides is rendered desolate. Our fighter-bombers may have the accuracy, but when something needs to be vaporized, our bombers are the sole answer. Further refining our discipline training for runs will drastically improve the lethalty of our bombers and lay waste to our enemies' supply lines."
  SOL_deliver_death:0 "Deliverers of Death"
  SOL_deliver_death_desc:0 "The first prototypes of what our avionics researchers are calling jet engines have already begun to be developed and refined. Designing entire planes around the speed and agility that they provide will further enhance our air force's ability to decimate a battlefield in support of our troops. Before our enemies can even fire back, our jet fighter-bombers will be nothing but distant dots in the sky."
  SOL_desolation_engines:0 "Engines of Desolation"
  SOL_desolation_engines_desc:0 "As the first generation of jet engines eventually begin development, creating long-range bombers that can take advantage of these powerful tools will make our current squadrons of judgement deliverance untouchable. Despite our enemies' best efforts, they will be unable to catch or apprehend the Empress's hoofs as they deal justice upon them."
  SOL_judge_ground:0 "Judges of the Ground"
  SOL_judge_ground_desc:0 "From the sky, the battlefield is nothing but a landscape of chaos and disorder. Only those that are above it have the true clarity needed to determine which enemy strongholds are worthy of punishment at that time. Whatever their decision, our pilots shall be the ultimate arbiter of Daybreaker's fury. In their assault's wake nothing shall be left standing."
  SOL_order_skies:0 "Order of the Skies"
  SOL_order_skies_desc:0 "Although we have elevated one doctrinal aspect of our air force, that does not mean that the other is without merit. Organized, cooperative branches within it are necessary for Harmony's defense from those that would see it fall to Chaos. Together, our fighter and bomber divisions will be envied worldwide, for all shall see how our air force works in unity. They will forever be an unbreachable shield of the sky."
  SOL_heavenly_backdrop:0 "Backdrop of Heaven"
  SOL_heavenly_backdrop_desc:0 "As our technology and doctrine improves, our strategic bombers will be able to reach further and further targets upon Equus and ultimately the world. To reach these distances, high-altitude flying is expected. Much like angelic beings, they will deliver their judgement of the Empress with extreme prejudice and loyalty, while remaining unseen from above to all those deemed guilty."
  SOL_breyns_dream:0 "Touching the Sun"
  SOL_breyns_dream_desc:0 "Since the dawn of pony civilization ponies were fascinated with the heavens and the sun itself. Although this religious fascination and sun worship has faded, this interest has never perished. Neigher von Breyn has developed a number of working prototypes for what he  calls Project Heilige. Although ambitious, these could be a cheap way to deliver payloads long-range, and should be pursued where possible."
  SOL_project_solar_flare:0 "The Solar Flare Project"
  SOL_project_solar_flare_desc:0 "There is little that is more beautiful than the Empress's sun. Harnessing that power without magic, even if it would be a fraction of the power of it, is the ultimate way in which we can honor her who protects us. Project Solar Flare will ultimately split the atom, and with it, a new era of warfare, where every army has a little piece of the Empress with them."
  SOL_skyborn:0 "Born to the Sky"
  SOL_skyborn_desc:0 "The changelings may have wings and the griffons may have agility, but neither are solely suited to the clouds like ponies and to a greater extent, pegasi. Since the earliest days of Equestria, we have ruled the sky like no other. There is little that could possibly change that now, as our pilots are but one with their machines."

  ###Ministry of Defense###
  SOL_airfields2:0 "Airfields of Southern Equestria"
  SOL_airfields2_desc:0 "In an effort to defend ourselves in case of war, we should construct a series of inter-connecting airports, so that if conflict comes to [ROOT.GetNameDef], we shall have the ability to rapidly respond and spread out our air force to cover the skies. As a bonus, the general commerce of these regions will be improved through air traffic."
  SOL_airfields:0 "Airfields of Central Equestria"
  SOL_airfields_desc:0 "As one of the first efforts of the Ministry of Defence, a series of air bases shall be constructed throughout the central plains of [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [CRY.GetNameDef], so that there will be more coverage over our skies if war were to break out. Additionally, this will provide valuable experience to the ponies who may one day become our next generation of pilots."
  SOL_canterbbean_grinder:0 "The Canterbbean Grinder"
  SOL_canterbbean_grinder_desc:0 "Our southern island territories are woefully underdefended and the military infrastructure is poor and wholly inadequate. If an enemy of [ROOT.GetNameDef] were to successfully navigate their way through the island chains of the Canterbbean, we would struggle to respond to them. We will construct further naval infrastructure in the region, so that we can station larger fleets to protect our waters."
  SOL_vanhoover_stations:0 "Vanhoover Stations"
  SOL_vanhoover_stations_desc:0 "Vanhoover lies across a narrow stretch of water separating [OLE.GetNameDef] and our territory. If the [OLE.GetAdjectiveCap] territory were to be used as a staging ground for invasion, we would have little time to respond and scramble our defenses in Luna Bay. As a measure of protection, we shall construct a series of forts and bases along the coast, so we may ward off any unexpected aggression."
  SOL_north_naval_games:0 "Naval Games of the North"
  SOL_north_naval_games_desc:0 "The waters of Northern Equus are treacherous and have claimed a number of ships in the centuries since the settlement of the Griffish Isles. However, other nations patrol those seas, and we must be prepared for war with them. Extensive naval games to learn the terrain and weather conditions will prepare us for just that eventuality."
  SOL_changeling_menace:0 "Anti-Changeling Tactics"
  SOL_changeling_menace_desc:0 "The bugs are brutish, bloodthirsty, and merciless. Their magic lends them subterfuge, and more than one battle against them has been turned by supposed [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] arriving to only reveal themselves as changeling infiltrators. However, we have determined weaknesses in their magic. Every soldiers shall receive this training to spot deception in the field."
  SOL_operation_wasserkoenigin:0 "Operation Wasserkönigin"
  SOL_operation_wasserkoenigin_desc:0 "In the event of war with a cross-continental enemy, we must prepare ourselves for an inevitable slog through beachheads on their shorelines. Our forces have so far had little experience with the dangers of a naval invasion, and would do well to practice what would be required in an attack upon Griffonia or Zebrica, so that we may maintain our crown of the seas."
  SOL_variegated_survival_training:0 "Variegated Survival Training"
  SOL_variegated_survival_training_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] is a land filled with varied climates and dangers. A pony can travel a couple of hundred kilometers and see grand mountains, searing desert, sweltering jungle, and smothering forest. With so much opportunity to experience every possible condition, we should implement a series of survival training exercises to our forces so they can experience every environment imaginable."
  SOL_canterlot_fort_line:0 "The Canterlot Fort Line"
  SOL_canterlot_fort_line_desc:0 "Despite our efforts of training our soldiers, [CHN.GetLeader] has still managed to push us back. While the Empress battles with us and has slain thousands of bugs herself, she cannot be everywhere at once. We must prepare for the worst, and further strengthen our position in our heartlands, so that the light of Harmony and Order will never fade."
  SOL_combined_arms_exercises:0 "Combined Arms Exercises"
  SOL_combined_arms_exercises_desc:0 "[CHN.GetNameDefCap], while focused primarily on tank warfare, has shown the benefit of combining all aspects of a military to coordinate as tightly as possible. While a tank army may punch through a front line, it is the infantry that shores it up and the planes that keep the tanks protected from the sky. We must adapt to these modern conditions, and pen tactics to overcome such obstacles."
  SOL_defense_in_order:0 "Defense in Order"
  SOL_defense_in_order_desc:0 "Enemies may come and fall, but the Empress is eternal. In her, Harmony is preserved through Order. Society has already proven this, and applying this to our forces, where every officer is hoof-picked to their position will ensure that the highest quality troops will follow us."
  SOL_tactics_of_destruction:0 "Tactics of Destruction"
  SOL_tactics_of_destruction_desc:0 "Our enemies are numerous and we must be prepared for some of our rightful land being impinged upon. That does not mean we will go lightly. Empowering rabid adherents to Daybreaker and using scorched earth tactics when faced with overwhelming odds will ensure that our opponents will be left with nothing and will still suffer for every inch of that wasteland they hold!"

  ###Industry###
  SOL_tabulate_ponies:0 "Tabulate the Ponies"
  SOL_tabulate_ponies_desc:0 "If we are to accurately repair the damage that has been wrought upon our economy through decades of greed and slothfulness, we must perform a census of the land. The last was done two decades ago, and is woefully outdated. Once an accurate picture of the Empress's ponies is provided, we can effectively reform our industrial base."
  SOL_trains_across_empire:0 "Trains Across the Empire"
  SOL_trains_across_empire_desc:0 "When the steam engine was invented and locomotion was developed, the old Equestria took it upon itself to connect the nation from one end to the other. In over a century of having rail within [ROOT.GetNameDef], that dream has not been fully realized. There are still regions which could stand for better connection with [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and we must provide that."
  SOL_imperial_work_service:0 "Imperial Work Service"
  SOL_imperial_work_service_desc:0 "It is in everypony's nature to work. If a pony has nothing to do, they will slowly be driven insane, as has been documented time and again. With the restructuring of the government after [ROOT.GetLeader]'s enlightenment, there are some general changes that will need to be implemented to improve the efficiency of the economy. A board to coordinate jobs will be of benefit to all."
  SOL_invest_in_manehattan:0 "Expand Manehattan's Military Capacity"
  SOL_invest_in_manehattan_desc:0 "Manehattan is the largest city in [ROOT.GetNameDef] and is the base for multiple civilian corporations and the seat of the venerated Manehattan Institute of Technology. However, its military industry is woefully behind much of [ROOT.GetNameDef] and where the Empress wishes it to be. Thankfully, there are more than enough bits to inject into its local economy to fix that issue."
  SOL_south_eastern_investment:0 "South-Eastern Investment"
  SOL_south_eastern_investment_desc:0 "The South-East has generally been neglected, despite the numerous settlements and abundant natural resources. The two largest settlements, Baltimare and Stableside, are perfect for expansion, and with their access to the wealth of the South-East, are ideal for expanding our military's production capacity. All they need is a little boost."
  SOL_imperial_transport_ministry:0 "Establish the Imperial Transport Ministry"
  SOL_imperial_transport_ministry_desc:0 "Although there are a few lines between cities and towns and [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that are publicly owned, the vast majority of our rail network is controlled by private investors and businesses. While this allowed for rapid growth of our railways, it is becoming a liability. Creating a new ministry for overseeing the nation's rail lines will allow us to always prioritize our own logistics over others."
  SOL_dodge_city_oil:0 "Dodge City Oil Fields"
  SOL_dodge_city_oil_desc:0 "Dodge City has been an entrance to the Mild West for decades. While it primarily produces crops, it lies on the edge of the Silent Desert and was never prospected for oil when Appleloosa and the San Palimino were found to be rich in it. Recently, however, deposits of crude have been discovered, and it is best we invest in it before monopolies form. The injection of bits will be a boon to the area, too."
  SOL_project_firestorm:0 "Project Firestorm"
  SOL_project_firestorm_desc:0 "There are a number of aeronautic companies along the eastern seaboard of [ROOT.GetNameDef] which have sprung up in the advent of modern flight. Although they concern themselves with commercial and civilian aircraft, some of their teams have banded together to contribute to our defense. With a few more grants, this project to develop a worthwhile dive-bomber may yet bear some fruit."
  SOL_blessed_unicorn_academy:0 "Imperial Collegiate of Blessed Unicorns"
  SOL_blessed_unicorn_academy_desc:0 "In the old regime, Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns was the most prestigious university in the land. Originally, its students were hoofpicked by the Empress, but later it expanded to cover any promising unicorn. In the past few years, however, it has become diluted with curriculum outside of thaumaturgy. A rebrand is in order. Education must be correct, after all."
  SOL_imperial_unions:0 "Imperial Unions"
  SOL_imperial_unions_desc:0 "In the previous regime, industrial workers occasionally organized into unions to fight against what were seen as unfair compensation and dangerous working conditions. This contributed to the rebellion in [STG.GetNameDef] but it was never outlawed. While factory owners desire crackdowns, it is better we encourage them. Would the Empress be caring if she didn't support her ponies' well-being?"
  SOL_imperial_production_committee:0 "Imperial Production Committee"
  SOL_imperial_production_committee_desc:0 "Before the Empress ascended, the economy was entirely free market and workers were permitted to unionize in an effort to fight for better compensation. However, as this behavior contributed to the insurrection in [STG.GetNameDef] and has negatively impacted others' lives, it will be officially banned. An oversight board will ensure production quotas are met, no matter how much overtime is needed."
  SOL_mining_company_poaching:0 "Poach Mining Company Scientists"
  SOL_mining_company_poaching_desc:0 "As [ROOT.GetNameDef] expands, it will require heavier equipment to defend itself and enforce the Empress's will. While it is true there are a number of talented military scientists, some of the most gifted in this kind of platform work for civilian industry, and in mining specifically. They may be comfortable right now, but we can certainly put a squeeze on them, and offer better benefits to them in the long run."
  SOL_trawl_mountain_depths:0 "Trawl the Depths of the Mountains"
  SOL_trawl_mountain_depths_desc:0 "There are number of mountain ranges in [ROOT.GetNameDef], most which have been left untapped. Much has already been excavated within the [39.GetName], yet we have not plumbed them in their entirety yet. Although they will not be as in-depth, our other ranges most likely have many unexploited deposits, and further surveys will at least bring some to light."
  SOL_mundane_and_arcane:0 "The Mundane and the Arcane"
  SOL_mundane_and_arcane_desc:0 "Although ponies have abilities like no other race upon the planet, that does not mean that it should be our sole pursuit. If we fall behind on the simple things in life, such as the steady beat of progress in industry, we will be left facing odds that we could have avoided. There are many intelligent ponies in the Empire. They only require the guidance that can be provided by the Empress."
  SOL_magical_primacy:0 "Magical Primacy"
  SOL_magical_primacy_desc:0 "Since ponykind's earliest days, we have utilized our magic in ways of which the other races could only be envious. Over the millennia, those abilities have flourished and much of our society revolves around the innate magic of earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns. Yet there are always untapped avenues of potential, especially with the advent of matrix tech. We must encourage these if we are to remain dominant."
  SOL_tools_of_empire:0 "Tools of an Empire"
  SOL_tools_of_empire_desc:0 "If we are to remain ahead of our enemies, we must strive for automation and technology that is yet a pipe dream for many. While the assembly line and turret lathe have served us well, they are still ultimately limited by ponypower. Reaching beyond these points must be our goal."
  SOL_imperial_hoofbooks:0 "Imperial Hoofbooks"
  SOL_imperial_hoofbooks_desc:0 "With the Empress's blessing of unionization, an official ministry of labor has been established to oversee standardization of working conditions within [ROOT.GetNameDef], which has already begun investigating reports by new unions regarding safety violations, and from there, has penned a number of guidelines. They are not onerous, but the punishment will be if they are not followed to the letter."
  SOL_motivation_teams:0 "Motivation Teams"
  SOL_motivation_teams_desc:0 "Occasionally, workers may believe that there is more to their job than obeying every order which they are given. With extended hours in the wake of threats to the Empress, grumbling has been growing more common within the blue collar populace. However, there are always some who are loyal to the Empress. Empowering them to enforce her will shall ensure that not a single quota is missed."
  SOL_revitalize_imperial_shipyards:0 "Revitalize the Imperial Shipyards"
  SOL_revitalize_imperial_shipyards_desc:0 "Although the old regime maintained one of the largest navies in the world, the naval industry grew complacent and was permitted to atrophy. A number of hulls were once laid but have since remained untouched, and their dockyards have fallen into disrepair. Providing grants to repair these yards and finish production will drastically improve our ability to respond to dangers form the sea."
  SOL_project_starscream:0 "Project Starscream"
  SOL_project_starscream_desc:0 "With our armored corps growing, numerous research teams have begun protoype iterations and experimentation. One of them, at MIT, has come forward with a brain foal of its lead scientist, Oxide. Inspired by the superheavy movers of various mining corporations, his project, codenamed Starscream, seeks to construct the largest chassis known to ponykind! A project this grand must only be funded by the Empress."
  SOL_promote_mit:0 "Elevate the Manehattan Institute of Technology"
  SOL_promote_mit_desc:0 "The Manehattan Institute of Technology has been a cornerstone of technological innovation for over a century, since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution within the Empire. Although it has never been maligned nor has it had its funding cut, it deserves more, now that the Empress requires the brightest minds serving her. Further supporting the university in its endeavors will cement our technological lead."
  SOL_establish_sol_victoria:0 "Establish Sol Victoria University"
  SOL_establish_sol_victoria_desc:0 "Bales, although not a university city, has one of the largest book and tome collections in the Empire. Centuries-old treatises and theses are ripe for establishing a new line of education, based solely around delving into ponies' magical abilities. With a significant investment, we shall establish a new university, dedicated to the Empress's beauty and power. It will reveal the last secrets of ponykind in time."
  SOL_crystal_creator_machines:0 "Crystal-Powered Creator Machines"
  SOL_crystal_creator_machines_desc:0 "As our thaumaturgy and technology have improved, there are clear areas where they can be combined to create unseen wonders. After extensive testing, Pear Industries is ready to implement a trial in some of their factories of automated construction machines. If these are successful, we can only imagine how they could serve the Empress in protecting Order."
  SOL_bunsen_beaker_research:0 "Integrate Bunsen Beaker's Research"
  SOL_bunsen_beaker_research_desc:0 "Bales has seen a number of scientists flock to it in order to research what knowledge there could be within their libraries. One of the most prominent thaumaturgy teams there is comprised of one Bunsen Beaker and his assistant Pinpoint. Although decried as unorthodox, they have discovered numerous breakthroughs in pony physiology. It'd be foalish to not absorb them into the government's own work."
  SOL_practical_metal_applications:0 "Applied Metal Advancements"
  SOL_practical_metal_applications_desc:0 "Although metallurgy has been an art for centuries, there are always ways to further refine the process. Whether it is through more efficient steel forging or determining better recycling methods, our metallurgists have slowly and surely improved how we can construct our most deadly machines, so that we can drown our enemnies in heavy weaponry."
  SOL_grants_for_tithes:0 "Grants for Donations"
  SOL_grants_for_tithes_desc:0 "There remain a number of regions within [ROOT.GetNameDef] that have been ignored or underdeveloped by corporations and general industry. We are a nation of extensive resources, with still much untapped natural wealth. Through kickbacks and direct support, we can motivate companies to expand their reach, and thereby benefiting us all."
  SOL_practical_magic_applications:0 "Practical Magical Applications"
  SOL_practical_magic_applications_desc:0 "Use cases for applying magic to a situation are almost unlimited, but taking the time to develop entirely new fields is not a luxury that we have at this time. Augmenting various aspects of our military, in both offensive and defensive aspects, will have significant pay-off with little effort. It is hard to argue with an amplified artillery shell flattening an entire street block."
  SOL_pony_mystics:0 "Pony Mystics"
  SOL_pony_mystics_desc:0 "The mysteries of magic are all around us. Through utilizing magic in every possible way, we can achieve levels of awareness and reaction that has never been seen by the other races. Although these practices are sometimes seen as nothing but quackery, there is no argument that many of our own mages who have studied contemplation and mindfulness of their abilities have become even more deadly."
  SOL_annex_star_energy:0 "Annex Star Energy's Assets"
  SOL_annex_star_energy_desc:0 "Star Energy has remained fully private since its inception, unlike many of its fellow corporations, which have gone public years ago. While the Empress now maintains a generous share in each company that directly serves her military needs, Star Energy is still a roadblock. Although it may not be popular, it is time that Star Energy join the fold. By force, if necessary."
  SOL_new_radar:0 "Second-Generation RADAR Devices"
  SOL_new_radar_desc:0 "With the advent of RADAR, we have discovered a completely new way in which we can pre-emptively react to threats to Harmony and Order. However, it is just in its infancy, and while there are surely refinements, we can also brute force improvements by merging it with thaumaturgical aspects. Applying matrices and spells should greatly enhance our ability to see the unseen."
  SOL_bounties_of_earth:0 "Bounties of the Earth"
  SOL_bounties_of_earth_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetNameDef] stretches across the only prairie and temperate lands on Equus, much of which still lies empty. Ponies have predominantly remained integrated with nature, with earth ponies frequently harmonizing with the landscapes and the beauty of the land. There is little reason to encourage them otherwise, but we shall require them to till more soil than before. More food means more bodies for the Empress's protection."
  SOL_exploit_bosom:0 "Exploit Equestria's Heart"
  SOL_exploit_bosom_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] stretches across various ecosystems and biomes, many of which have remained untouched. However, with a fairly low population density, the concerns of many ponies, of a land that becomes shrouded in soot and grime, will never happen. While we will lose some potential farmland and perhaps some sensitive environments, it is a small price to pay for the mineral wealth we can acquire."
  SOL_sanctum_solar_directorate:0 "Directorate of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Science"
  SOL_sanctum_solar_directorate_desc:0 "Although the EEA technically is an education organization that oversees the state of the Empire's student and research body, it focuses on standards rather than direct guidance and overarching, scientific policy. Although we have brilliant researchers Empire-wide, they are uncoordinated and disorderly. By [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] decree, a central authority will be formed and thereby direct our scientific pursuits."
  SOL_expand_sol_invicta_academy:0 "Expand Sol Invicta Academy"
  SOL_expand_sol_invicta_academy_desc:0 "Sol Invicta Academy was not always called that. Through forced retirements and "protest" resignations, there has been a sweeping restructuring on its board. Previously, it was similar in many ways to the Imperial Collegiate, and has had an overlapping educational base for years. But new ownership means new goals, and dedicating it to military science will rapidly improve our doctrinal theory."
  SOL_military_industrial_complex:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
  SOL_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Harmony is constantly under assault from all angles. Every day, more supplies are demanded from our soldiers in its defense. While there has always been a level of involvement with our scattered defense industry, it is time it grows more formalized. Although the Empress will always dictate final policy, the most influential of the defense contractors should have a say in economic policy to aid Harmony's protection."
  SOL_early_matrix_machines:0 "Early Matrix Computational Devices"
  SOL_early_matrix_machines_desc:0 "While manual calculation and computational machines have been around for decades, the trick is in automating the process. Preliminary results on a number of matrix-based devices that have been etched with novel runes indicate that these "microprocessors" can take inputs and provide accurate outputs. Further funding these experiments will take us leaps and bounds ahead of any other nation on the planet!"
  SOL_ingrain_eea_authority:0 "Ingrain the EEA"
  SOL_ingrain_eea_authority_desc:0 "For a generations, the Equestrian Education Association has ensured the highest quality material is provided to students across the land. They have instilled honest, integrety, and above all else, loyalty, and it is only a matter of a few changes that will see them permanently in control of the curriculum. Those tweaks, though, may require a small visit from the Empress. To ensure regulatory compliance."
  SOL_rewrite_eea_rules:0 "Rewrite EEA Guidelines"
  SOL_rewrite_eea_rules_desc:0 "Since its inception, the Equestrian Education Association has kept the curriculum of schools across the land held to the highest quality standards. However, its board has remained hesitant to fully approve of the new new message that the Empress speaks. To avoid further, needless stalling, it is time the EEA be given a new role. The Empress will teach, and they will disseminate. Anything else is anti-Order."

  ###Crystal Empire###
  SOL_mock_empire:0 "The Mock Empire"
  SOL_mock_empire_desc:0 "With the ascension of [ROOT.GetLeader] and the proclamation of [ROOT.GetNameDef], [CRY.GetNameDef] was the first to abandon us and forsake Harmony. [CRY.GetLeader] has remained antagonistic through continued refusal to submit to the Empress. Unlike our true empire, [CRY.GetNameDef] is nothing but a wasteland, barring a few cities. It is time they learn that returning to the fold is not optional."
  SOL_follow_sunrise_plan:0 "Follow Sunrise's Plan"
  SOL_follow_sunrise_plan_desc:0 "After speaking with the Empress, her Lady Inquisitor Sunrise Sparkle has rightly pointed out a connection that can be exploited. Her family still reigns on the throne of [CRY.GetNameDef], and news of her capture and enlightenment is conflicted with reports that she is on the run. If she were to play the innocent rebel, seeking shelter, she could accomplish far more than a simple show of strength."
  SOL_gesture_of_strength:0 "A Gesture of Strength"
  SOL_gesture_of_strength_desc:0 "As rightful [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] territory, [CRY.GetNameDef] has illegally seceded from the [ROOT.GetFactionName] and has forfeited their right to recognition. However, the Empress is nothing but merciful, and shall give the foals in [CRY.GetName] a single chance of repentance. To show her might, somepony worthy will be sent as her represenative. There will be a simple message: submit or perish."
  SOL_royal_province:0 "The Royal Province"
  SOL_royal_province_desc:0 "Wisely, [CRY.GetNameDef] has folded and returned to be in Harmony with the rest of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. As her newest subjects, the crystal ponies have yet to be graced by the Empress. [CRY.GetLeader] has ensured that there will be proper preparation and ceremony as she begins her grand tour. A reminder of her power and majesty will ensure that the crystal ponies understand their place within Harmony."
  SOL_destroy_night_guard:0 "Destroy the Night Guard"
  SOL_destroy_night_guard_desc:0 "When the Empress ascended, much of Luna's Night Guard fled. Some scattered to Zebrica, others escaped to [EQC.GetNameDef], and yet more ran to [CRY.GetNameDef]. These rogue elements now combat our rightful rule and spread dangerous misinformation amongst the populace. Yet are not invisible and [ROOT.GetAgency] will easily root them out, permanently."
  SOL_umbrum_military_industrial_parks:0 "Umbrum Military Industrial Parks"
  SOL_umbrum_military_industrial_parks_desc:0 "The Umbrum Cage is a strategic point in the southern [CRY.GetName], as its mountains have remained untapped of the magical crystals that are abundant within the country. In an effort to improve the usefulness of [CRY.GetNameDef], a great manufactory shall be constructed to extract these crystals for the good of the Empress."
  SOL_family_visits:0 "Family Visits"
  SOL_family_visits_desc:0 "Although not by blood, Cadance is the niece of our Empress, and before [CRY.GetNameDef] deserted, they remained close. It has been some time since the Empress has properly visited her extended family, and while the royal family doesn't have the same influence they did, convincing Cadance to support us will only further our regime's legitimacy in the eyes of the populace."
  SOL_investments_in_empire:0 "Investments into the Empire"
  SOL_investments_in_empire_desc:0 "Much of [CRY.GetNameDef] is uninhabitated or severely underdeveloped compared to [ROOT.GetNameDef]. This severely weakens their ability to aid us in event of an attack upon our lands. As a show of grace, funds will be allocated from the [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] Treasury, to directly stimulate the [CRY.GetAdjectiveCap] economy and build a foundation for the future."
  SOL_update_northern_tactics:0 "Update Northern Tactics"
  SOL_update_northern_tactics_desc:0 "As it was locked in time for a thousand years, [CRY.GetNameDef] has remained woefully behind in many aspects of society, most notably, its military tactics. Shining Armor did much for improvement, but they are still behind where the Imperial High Command is. Through sharing some of our insights, we can provide them knowledge in general warfare, while we gain valuable experience in winter combat in return."
  SOL_establish_crystal_legion:0 "Establish the Crystal Legion"
  SOL_establish_crystal_legion_desc:0 "Still most soldiers who form the military of [CRY.GetNameDef] come from the populace, but that is dangerous while the regime is still aligning the nation with our own. As a reminder to whom they owe their loyalty, an elite force from our lands will be dispatched to remain in the Crystal City, only answerable to [CRY.GetLeader] and the Empress herself."
  SOL_monarchy_compliance:0 "Love's Loss"
  SOL_monarchy_compliance_desc:0 "As she is no longer ruler of [CRY.GetNameDef], Princess Cadance has been left with little to do. Even in her submission, she has remained resistant to the Empress's wisdom, but she has not yet seen the consequences of her actions. In her grace, the Empress has summoned Cadance to [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where she will learn the error of her ways. Soon, she will lovingly guide all to the Empress and Harmony."
  SOL_appoint_economic_advisors:0 "Appoint Economic Advisors"
  SOL_appoint_economic_advisors_desc:0 "There is a severe lack of qualified ponies within [CRY.GetNameDef] to run an economy. With the rapid onset of the Industrial Revolution, few were able to adapt to it fully and gain enough knowledge to be useful. Dispatching some of the brightest minds of the Imperial Court will further ensure compliance, and align the [CRY.GetAdjectiveCap] with our own in short order."
  SOL_retire_old_guard:0 "Retire the Old Guard"
  SOL_retire_old_guard_desc:0 "The Crystal Army is filled with a number of ponies still resistant to the Empress, and they have caused insubordination within the armed forces many times already. They are no longer required. Chief among their conspirators is Prince Shining Armor. Although he is too influential to execute, he can be relieved of duty, and his lackeys along with him. They should be thankful they are not shot instead."
  SOL_rouse_godhood:0 "Awaken Flurry to Her Deity"
  SOL_rouse_godhood_desc:0 "The Empress's young niece, Princess Flurry Heart is a naturally-born alicorn. This rarity is unprecedented, and her talents have so far been wasted. Only somepony born into deity could have had such a miraculous creation. If Flurry Heart will not be instructed in her birthright, then there is only one pony who can do so: our God-Empress."
  SOL_cadance_university:0 "Mi Amore Unversity"
  SOL_cadance_university_desc:0 "Education in the finer knowledge of Order and Harmony is lacking within [CRY.GetNameDef]. Establishing a new university, ostensibly dedicated to Princess Cadance will further draw in minds, where they can be corrected to understand the struggle that everypony is, and how they must defend the Empress with their last breath."
  SOL_polished_armor_arsenals:0 "Polished Armor Arsenals"
  SOL_polished_armor_arsenals_desc:0 "With some of the highest concentration of magical crystals on Equus, [CRY.GetNameDef] is ripe for experimentation and improvement of old magical weapon designs. To help safeguard the Empress, grants shall be given for establishing new manufacturing concerns, so that the weapons that fight for Harmony may bring as much Order to the world as possible."
  SOL_imperial_mind:0 "The Imperial Mind"
  SOL_imperial_mind_desc:0 "As the crystal ponies have adapted to life under the Empress, they have grown more aligned with the great needs of Harmony and Order. Although at one point they would have decried reforms as unethical or immoral, they now see that much must be sacrificed on the altar of Harmony. Already their economy is aligned, and now their scientists are prodding the limits of their race, ethical quandries be damned."
  SOL_imperial_guardian:0 "The Imperial Guardian"
  SOL_imperial_guardian_desc:0 "As much of the land is frozen wasteland, [CRY.GetNameDef] is ideally situated to protect our northern territories. Without the nagging naysayers of Shining Armor's clique and with the invigorated youth who have accepted the Empress, [CRY.GetNameDef] shall be a ward against all Disharmony and Chaos in the artict fringes as well as be our shield in times of trouble elsewhere on Equus."

  ###Bats###
  SOL_bat_problems:0 "The Bat Problem"
  #SOL_bat_problems_desc:0 "Now that we have our hooves firmly planted on the ground and our rule is secured, we must solve the issue of thestrals as soon as possible. These "children of the night" have to be dealt with in an appropriate manner."
  SOL_bat_problems_desc:0 "The situation has stabilized in the Empire, but there still remain a host of issues that have been thus far unaddressed. Chiefest among them is the issue of the thestrals, who have resisted the Empress more rabidly than any other group. They claim to be the night's children, so they must be handled with prejudice for their crimes against Harmony."
  SOL_fire_and_brimstone:0 "Fire and Brimstone"
  SOL_fire_and_brimstone_desc:0 "Thestrals have been behind issues and pains within the rest of Equus for generations, which originated when they first sided with Nightmare Moon. Because of her rebellious nature, they have been tainted. There is no redemption for them, for they will always be opposed to us. Therefore, we must show them that we are their superiors, and by the only language they will understand."
  SOL_what_homes:0 "What Homes?"
  SOL_what_homes_desc:0 "In the past, thestrals resided across Equus, with the only remnant of that being the settlements within Hollow Shades that we have yet to penetrate. However, upon which they have constructed their new homes is rightful Imperial territory. They sided with Nightmare Moon a thousand years ago. They have never integrated back into our society. What right do they have to anything within our Empire?"
  SOL_what_jobs:0 "What Jobs?"
  SOL_what_jobs_desc:0 "While they might have been useful, as some have called them, in improving the economy, thestrals run far too much of a risk in sharing sensitive information with our enemies. They are nosy, they are forever curious, and worst of all, they will speak to whomever will ask them their secrets. Our only solution will be economically painful in the short term, but yield our safety in the future."
  SOL_burn_bats:0 "§OBURN THE BATS!§!"
  SOL_burn_bats_desc:0 "Thestrals, the "Children of the Night," are a danger to us all. They spread lies, deceptions, and sew discontent against the Empress wherever they live. All attempts to reason with them will only end in failure.\n\nThere is only solution to them: §OFire§!."
  SOL_enlighten_darkness:0 "Enlightening the Darkness"
  SOL_enlighten_darkness_desc:0 "Thestrals may be considered "Children of the Night," but they are still ponies. Incredibly misguided ponies, but ponies nonetheless. To that end, is it not the role of the Empress to ensure that they are shown the error of their ways and given a chance to turn from their error? A small number already obey here, so it is only a matter of opening the gates to let them all in to a greater understanding of her."
  SOL_second_class_employers:0 "Second-Class Employers"
  SOL_second_class_employers_desc:0 "Although thestrals should contribute to our economy, they must keep to themselves. Their minds are clouded by their ties to Nightmare Moon, and could very well inadvertently lead one of our loyal citizens away from a proper respect to the Empress. As they simply cannot contribute to society as a normal pony can, it is reasonable to allow separate work structures, to accomodate their lowly contributions."
  SOL_mandatory_education:0 "Mandatory Education"
  SOL_mandatory_education_desc:0 "The greatest error that reamins unrectified is that the thestrals are still allowed to instruct their young in their corrupt ways. This will only spawn further generations of rebels and lovers of the night and darkness. Some may even defect to those who believe that Nightmare Moon is alive and will save them. There is a simple solution. They must learn what it means to not be a thestral."
  SOL_useful_servants:0 "Useful Servants"
  SOL_useful_servants_desc:0 "Although thestrals can never achieve what the rest of ponykind has, due to their dark and corrupt nation, they can still contribute. They are witty and quick in their thoughts, no matter how debased, and have shown they have aptitude for menial or physical labor. Loosening our previous restrictions on them will only serve to benefit us into the future."
  SOL_peninsula_of_damned:0 "Peninsula of the Damned"
  SOL_peninsula_of_damned_desc:0 "Although thestrals made their ancestral home within the South-Eastern Peninsula, they are not the only natives who inhabit the region. Both settlers from Northern Equus and the Neighua tribes call the peninsula home. Aside from the port cities, they languish in the interior in unseen squalor. Solving the issue will require multiple steps, but they shall taste the Empress's mercy before long!"
  SOL_prison_of_fire:0 "Prison of Fire"
  SOL_prison_of_fire_desc:0 "The Badlands are desolate, but they are rich with resources that remain unexploited. It would be too much to ask our citizens to suffer in the extreme conditions within, but not all ponies within the Empire are worthy of respect. Soon, sprawling complexes across the Badlands will hold thousands of prisoners who will spend their short lives toiling for the benefit of the Empire."
  SOL_peaks_of_wealth:0 "Peaks of Wealth"
  SOL_peaks_of_wealth_desc:0 "Across the mountain ranges in the South-East, there are many that have yet to be fully explored and surveyed. A logical place to begin would be where workers will be plentiful, and [30.GetName] will be the perfect staging point to begin extraction of additional resources for the betterment of the Empire's war machine. The thestrals should be thankful we provide them with any jobs at all."
  SOL_remote_no_more:0 "Remote No More"
  SOL_remote_no_more_desc:0 "The jungles of the South-East are some of the most poorly developed and connected places within the Empire. Much of the difficulty in improving them lies in the lack of infrastructure. While it may take excessive effort and be expensive, finally connecting the major centers together will only allow for simpler expansion in the future."
  SOL_expand_oil_fields:0 "Expand the Oil Fields"
  SOL_expand_oil_fields_desc:0 "Deep within the jungle lay untapped wells of the most precious liquid: oil. Due to the remoteness and difficulty of extracting, the fields so far have lain untapped, as the cost and the risk to pony life was too great for Equestrian officials. However, we have an untold number of prisoners who can perform the heavy work. What does it matter if we lose a few thousand in the process of feeding our tanks?"
  SOL_modern_south_east:0 "The Modern South-East"
  SOL_modern_south_east_desc:0 "Just because the South-East has historically remained backward doesn't mean that it always must be so. There are ponies across the peninsula who yearn to contribute to the Empire, and we shall grant them that request. Large injections of bits shall stimulate the economy of the region, and soon it will be a shining example of the Empress's charity and gift of prosperity."
  SOL_moonspeaker_tax:0 "Moonspeaker Tax"
  SOL_moonspeaker_tax_desc:0 "A small sect of thestrals, the Moonspeakers, are the priests of a religion centered around Nightmare Moon. They claim it is to Luna, but they are one and the same. However, they contain within their temple in [30.GetName] a repository of knowledge that rivals that of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. They shall be allowed to continue their worship, but they must permit outside eyes to see their works or face the Empress's justice."
  SOL_replanting_jungle:0 "Replanting the Jungle"
  SOL_replanting_jungle_desc:0 "As the only region on Equus that is the right climate for rubber trees, the South-East is an critical center of rubber production. As ponies have slowly expanded inward, some of these forests of rubber trees have been cleared or damaged, and if it continues, will stifle what can be used by the Empress. Extensive replanting efforts shall commence, that we will never run dry of tires for our vehicles."

  ###New Mareland###
  SOL_force_jet_sets_hoof:0 "Force Jet Set's Hoof"
  SOL_force_jet_sets_hoof_desc:0 "As a colony that was entirely funded by the Empress's purse when it first began, [EQC.GetNameDef] is a rightful crown colony of [ROOT.GetNameDef], and has unlawfully rejected our control. Governor Jet Set was supposed to bring it in line, but he has abandoned his calling and joined with rebels. It is time that a message is sent. A single offer of grace shall be given, or they will be wiped out."
  SOL_ensuring_loyalty:0 "Ensuring Loyalty"
  SOL_ensuring_loyalty_desc:0 "With [EQC.GetNameDef] rightfully within the [ROOT.GetFaction], there are those who worry that its distance from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will lead to consistent unrest and rebellion. Jet Set has proven that he requires guidance in maintaining order, so we shall dispatch a trusted pony, somepony capable. They will enforce the Empress's will, regardless of how much it is disliked."
  SOL_smooth_transitions:0 "Smooth Transitions"
  SOL_smooth_transitions_desc:0 "Jet Set has wisely chosen to accept the Empress's representative, and has recently communicated with [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] requesting further support for aligning his administration. Not only shall he receive what he requests, but a personal visit to the Empress is in order. After all, a reminder of whom he serves will jog his memory of how much he has been pardoned."
  SOL_faiths_reward:0 "Faith's Reward"
  SOL_faiths_reward_desc:0 "Arcane Nova has been a quick study since her rise within the Militarium, and she is zealous for enforcing the will of the Empress. With her discovery of Jet Set's true involvement with the rebels in [EQC.GetNameDef], it was only a matter of time before she would be determined worthy to lead the colony instead. Her fire for the Empress will ignite the nation itself!"
  SOL_empresss_eyes:0 "Empress's Eyes"
  SOL_empresss_eyes_desc:0 "History is not easily forgotten. While Jet Set has professed loyalty and his visit with the Empress left the impression that he will obey her, he did permit the secession of [EQC.GetNameDef]. While he may not require constant observation, his power must be limited, through replacing his yes-ponies with those loyal to the Empress."
  SOL_colonial_investments:0 "Colonial Stimulus"
  SOL_colonial_investments_desc:0 "When [GRD.GetNameDef] collapsed in 978 with the Republican Revolution, [EQC.GetNameDef] was hit extremely hard by the panicked sell-off by investors of their companies. While recovery is still underway, ponies still suffer. Injecting capital into building projects will at least provide temporary aid and provide a new understanding of the Empress's benevolence."
  SOL_homegrown_plan:0 "Homegrown Economic Recovery Plan"
  SOL_homegrown_plan_desc:0 "As a pony closer to the struggles of [EQC.GetNameDef] than the Empress, Jet Set has proposed expansive economic reforms and adjustments that will shove the economy of the colony into recovery as quickly as possible while maintaining a decent standard of living. While it will take longer, the benefit of a populace who has been 'heard' outweighs it, as they will follow unquestioningly."
  SOL_debt_council:0 "Imperial Debt Council"
  SOL_debt_council_desc:0 "The collapse of [EQC.GetNameDef]'s economy is clear evidence that they are unable to properly control their fiscal policies. Tying themselves too closely to [GRD.GetNameDef] was a ticking time bomb, and they are now suffering the consequences. Radical restructuring is needed. A council shall be formed, and whatever they deem necessary shall be done. No matter the suffering."
  SOL_fund_sunset_plays:0 "Fund Sunset Opera Performances"
  SOL_fund_sunset_plays_desc:0 "The Sunset Opera House is one of the modern marvels of Griffonia, and a testament to the passion of ponies across the globe. With the economic troubles, it has been less used than was intended. However, it is the perfect podium for expounding truths about our Empress. Approved plays will soon be performed there. Ponies will learn to love their Empress through song and poem!"
  SOL_personnel_support:0 "Personnel Support"
  SOL_personnel_support_desc:0 "[EQC.GetNameDefCap]'s armed forces have a dangerous amount of independence from [ROOT.GetNameDef], and have accepted such threats as zebra and thestrals into their midst. Unsurprisingly, anti-Order ideas run rampant through the organization, and it is a wonder they obey any orders. Arcane Nova has already provided name suggestions. There is little reason to deny her."
  SOL_allies_in_high_places:0 "Allies in High Places"
  SOL_allies_in_high_places_desc:0 "Jet Set has a number of contacts within the nobility that could provide useful assistance to him as he leads [EQC.GetNameDef]. Of course, he does not feel the need to reach out to them, as the colony is running well enough. However, some of his friends are much more invested in the Empress than he is. Assigning them to him will further curtail any thoughts of independence."
  SOL_expand_sunset_university:0 "Expand the University of Sunset"
  SOL_expand_sunset_university_desc:0 "As one of the only pony universities in Southern Griffonia, Sunset University has become more of a central pillar to education in [EQC.GetNameDef] since it returned to the fold. Students from within the Empire have begun to travel in exchange programs, and this should be encouraged. Sharing of the proper [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] mindset will transform [EQC.GetAdjectiveCap] from within!"
  SOL_griffon_workers:0 "Griffon Workers"
  SOL_griffon_workers_desc:0 "There is not an insignificant griffon minority within [EQC.GetNameDef] who have been historically marginalized. While their ultimate well-being is not our concern, they are a large enough body that employing them for labor will benefit all of ponykind. And for significant discounts, too."
  SOL_strip_mine_bauxite:0 "Strip Mine the Bauxite"
  SOL_strip_mine_bauxite_desc:0 "[EQC.GetNameDefCap] rests on extensive veins of aluminium, running throughout the colony. As it is mostly tied up in high-purity bauxite, it is ripe for the taking, but regulations have prevented much of this from being exploited. However, the Empress requires aluminium for her air force, and no amount of troublesome red tape will prevent it!"
  SOL_church_of_day:0 "Church of the Day-Goddess"
  SOL_church_of_day_desc:0 "Groups of members of the Solaris Cultus have recently emigrated from within the Empire to [EQC.GetNameDef] and Arcane Nova has welcomed them with open arms. Although they have only been there months, their numbers have swelled. Officially sanctioning this religion will encourage further loyalty and zealotry to the Empress and unite the land behind her."
  SOL_united_goal:0 "A United Goal"
  SOL_united_goal_desc:0 "As it is stuck on a foreign continent, [EQC.GetNameDef] is in a precarious position. In a wise move, Arcane Nova has returned to [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to speak directly to many of her peers in the Imperial Palace. If the colony is to survive, it must mimic the Empress in every way, so that our goal of Harmony and Order will prosper across the seas!"
  SOL_homeland_investments:0 "Investments from the Homeland"
  SOL_homeland_investments_desc:0 "As the economy of [EQC.GetNameDef] has recovered, interest in expansion into Griffonia has interested many companies based in Equus. If we are to maintain a strong hoofhold in Griffonia, providing grants and funding for these interested corporations will encourage them to obey and expand out to encompass the greater Empire's sphere."
  SOL_station_legions:0 "Station the Southern Legion"
  SOL_station_legions_desc:0 "Although there are a number of loyal ponies within [EQC.GetNameDef]'s military, they still have their chain of command to go through. As an insurance policy, one of the Empress's personal guard regiments will be established and dispatched to the colony. They will only answer to [EQC.GetLeader], so that the Empress's will shall always be enforced."
  SOL_cadet_militarium:0 "Cadet Militarium Branch"
  SOL_cadet_militarium_desc:0 "The instruction methods of the old regime in [EQC.GetNameDef] were woefully inadequate for the Empress's standards. Rather than fix what is broken, it shall be reborn instead. Instructors from [ROOT.GetNameDef] are already underway, and they will form a new branch of the Militarium, dedicated entirely to training a new generation of soldiers utterly loyal to Daybreaker."
  SOL_prisoner_restructuring:0 "Prisoner Restructuring"
  SOL_prisoner_restructuring_desc:0 "With the inspections of the government and institutions that have taken place under Arcane Nova, there is no shortage of guilty who have been detained in jail cells across [EQC.GetNameDef]. Rather than execution or rotting in prison, they could be far more useful for economic recovery. Working them to death will fix the country and solve a prisoner population problem to boot."
  SOL_refuge_in_sun:0 "Refuge in the Sun"
  SOL_refuge_in_sun_desc:0 "[EQC.GetNameDefCap] is blessed with a more pleasant climate than that of most of Equus. The Empress has used her Sun to shine light and protection into every corner of the colony. Due to this, hopefuls from across Equus have started to flock to [EQC.GetNameDef], and keeping the doors open wide will build a truly Imperial society, one pony at a time."
  SOL_economic_opportunity:0 "Land of Economic Opportunity"
  SOL_economic_opportunity_desc:0 "In an effort to further encourage economic recovery, [EQC.GetLeader] has approved reduction of taxes and grants for corporations and businesses that wish to relocate or expand into [EQC.GetNameDef]. Tax havens are despicable, but if it allows for restoring the might of our colony, then it will be tolerable. For now."
  SOL_world_station:0 "Station of the World"
  SOL_world_station_desc:0 "[EQC.GetNameDefCap] is located on the tip of Southern Griffonia, which allows it to control shipping going north from Zebrica or the East as well as be a short hop to the shores of [HIP.GetNameDef] or other regions of Griffonia. Constructing strategic military bases will give us the upper hoof if we must defend ourselves from the griffons, and provides defense for our weaker brethren."
  SOL_joint_military_expeditions:0 "Joint Military Expeditions"
  SOL_joint_military_expeditions_desc:0 "Although small compared to the Solaris Militarium, [EQC.GetNameDef]'s military is filled with brilliant officers.

They shall be given one chance at correcting their mistake, or their pathetic island will become nothing but a giant grave."
  SOL_communist_examples:0 "Altering the Deal"
  SOL_communist_examples_desc:0 "Although it is nascent compared to the haven of communism that is [STG.GetNameDef], [PCB.GetNameDef] has had a storied history with Marksists and recently endured an attempted coup. There is an undercurrent of sedition and disgruntlement with the Empress and it will not stand to let it continue. Ponsé Cocktail may have been popular, but he allowed this rot to set in. A more capable pony will resolve this instead."
  SOL_coercion_campaign:0 "Watching the Dog"
  SOL_coercion_campaign_desc:0 "Ponsé Cocktail has remained the popular leader of [PCB.GetNameDef] for a number of years, and while he has his reservations, he is capable enough that replacing him would be more effort than necessary. However, he cannot be left to his own devices, especially with the risk of a communist coup still possible. He need not worry. The Empress will watch his career with great interest."
  SOL_naval_staging_grounds:0 "Naval Staging Grounds"
  SOL_naval_staging_grounds_desc:0 "As [PCB.GetNameDef] is located within the southern Fire Sea and just north of the Canterbbean, its size permits it to be the perfect location for stationing some of the Empress's Imperial Navy. Not only will this provide us with a stronger position on the sea passages to Zebrica, but it will provide a visible presence of the Empress's might, in case of insurrection on the island."
  SOL_plumb_mountain_depths:0 "Plumb the Depths of the Mountains"
  SOL_plumb_mountain_depths_desc:0 "The majority of [PCB.GetNameDef] is jungle or farmland, although there is a small range near the capital. Although the majority of exports are rubber or sugar, the mountain itself is filled with precious minerals that are waiting to be tapped. Since the attempted revolution of 1005, companies have avoided the island, but the Empress is shrewd. Our own funds shall extract these resources, only for ourselves."
  SOL_isle_of_sun:0 "Isle of the Sun"
  SOL_isle_of_sun_desc:0 "While the island is ultimately insignificant, with [PCB.GetNameDef] stabilized, it is time that its autonomy be ended. There is little reason for the ponies, who have had their lives blessed by the warmth and protection of the Sun, should remain apart from her. Formally offering statehood will simplify administration going forward."

  ###Diplomacy###
  SOL_imperial_diplomatic_corps:0 "Imperial Diplomatic Corps"
  SOL_imperial_diplomatic_corps_desc:0 "We are not alone on this planet. While every knee should bow to the Empress and acknowledge her right to rule, it will take time for the minds of mortals and non-ponies to accept their inevitable fate. In the meantime, we should at least make over gestures of working with the international community, and we shall establish a department in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to handle all future communication with other nations."
  SOL_sustenance_workers:0 "Workers for Sustenance"
  SOL_sustenance_workers_desc:0 "[DRG.GetNameDefCap] can barely be considered a country, and even less of one that has any clout upon the international stage. Our Empress could wipe them from the face of the planet without a second thought, but she is generous. If they can agree to provide for us, we shall do all that we can to ensure that they can continue living. For now."
  SOL_insurance_policies:0 "Insurance Policies"
  SOL_insurance_policies_desc:0 "Although it is a backwater country [YAK.GetNameDef] nevertheless holds significant sway in the northern reaches of Equus. They have recently had spats between each other, with a splinter group forming [JAK.GetNameDef] and leading to more internal strife. We could easily swoop in and save the day, and promising to do so would keep the yaks under our hoof, so we can pressure them in just the right way."
  SOL_oil_existence:0 "Oil for Existence"
  SOL_oil_existence_desc:0 "Both [PLB.GetNameDef] and [PNG.GetNameDef] rest on significant deposits of oil across the Frozen North, yet they do not have the industrial capacity to utilize it, nor the ability to appreciate it for its true worth as fuel for our weapons of war. We will come with a simple proposal: submit it as tribute, or feel the wrath of the sun upon the frozen wastes."
  SOL_griffon_fealty:0 "Fealty of the Griffons"
  SOL_griffon_fealty_desc:0 "Just over two hundred years ago, Grover I officially established the small griffon towns along the north-eastern coast as Nova Griffonia, forever marring the otherwise pristine continent of Equus with a griffon claw. Now, this poor little colony has been left adrift, without the mighty [GRD.GetNameDef] to protect them. It would be simple to demand tribute of them. We just need to speak their language."
  SOL_reich_relations:0 "The Empire Across the Sea"
  SOL_reich_relations_desc:0 "There is not a single equal to our Empress, but there are a small number of nations who claim the title of Empire. Yet only [GRD.GetNameDef] is worthy of the Empress's attention, as they could realistically be the only one to prove to be a challenge.\n\nLet's put our best hoof forward, shall we?"

  ###Spies###
  EQS_agents_of_SMILE:0 "Agents of S.M.I.L.E."
  EQS_agents_of_SMILE_desc:0 "Since the Ponyville bugbear incident of 1003, it was apparent that reducing S.M.I.L.E.'s budget to a minimum and effectively shuttering the agency was a mistake. With new threats on the horizon, it is imperative that it adapt to the modern world of subterfuge. However, S.M.I.L.E.'s current director has proven stubborn and kept its focus on mythical beings only. It is time for a regime change."
  EQS_further_deep_cover_training:0 "Further Deep Cover Training"
  EQS_further_deep_cover_training_desc:0 "Many of S.M.I.L.E.'s agents went to ground after S.M.I.L.E.'s budget cuts, but they did not stop protecting the nation. There are many new recruits, and even some veterans, though, that have not experienced what is needed to maintain a false identity in enemy territory. For our operatives to succeed in future missions, they will need to know how to LIVE two lives for their very survival."
  EQS_renovate_old_quarters:0 "Renovate the Old Quarters"
  EQS_renovate_old_quarters_desc:0 "In the past, S.M.I.L.E.'s director had a personal abode within the agency's walls. When it was defunded, that was used for storage. Clearing out the old room for the new director will ensure that no matter what the emergency, the director will be available to respond immediately. It does not hurt that the room contains many magical devices for monitoring important regions, either."
  EQS_strike_moon:0 "Strike at the Moon"
  EQS_strike_moon_desc:0 "With the world in shambles, it is up to S.M.I.L.E. to keep [ROOT.GetNameDef] safe, even if that danger is from Princess Celestia's own sister. Whatever sanity Luna had has now been abandoned. Ponies that follow her are now threats to Harmony, and must be dealt with. A plan to at least temporarily weaken Luna's war effort by our agents will be the first sign to Luna that we will protect our freedom at any cost."
  EQS_harmony_abroad:0 "Harmony's Safety Abroad"
  EQS_harmony_abroad_desc:0 "As a bastion of peace and stability, the security of Harmony and all that has been maintained for over a thousand years by [ROOT.GetLeader] means that our agents cannot sit idly by. While they may not overturn a government, our agents must police other nations, to ensure that those who do not stand for Harmony are neutered and cannot threaten it in the future."
  EQS_keep_down_low:0 "Keep on the Down Low"
  EQS_keep_down_low_desc:0 "We must not risk the chance that our agents will be discovered meddling in other nations' affairs and destabilize our efforts for Harmony. Ultimately, so long as [ROOT.GetNameDef] remains a beacon of freedom and unity, other countries will desire to be like us. S.M.I.L.E. must remain vigilant, so that any foreign agents who wish to destroy these values from within are hampered and thwarted."
  EQS_anti_changeling_training:0 "Anti-Changeling Training"
  EQS_anti_changeling_training_desc:0 "In light of [CHN.GetLeader]'s continued aggression, it is clear that S.M.I.L.E. must prepare for the likelihood that [CHN.GetLeader.GetSheHe] will turn the changelings' focus upon us. As natural shapeshifters, they will infiltrate our lands easily. 1002 proved that. However, there are small tells, and our agents must be versed in these if they are to defend us and further Harmony within [CHN.GetNameDef]."
  EQS_moth_to_flame:0 "Moth to the Flame"
  EQS_moth_to_flame_desc:0 "[CHN.GetLeader] is a warmonger and a dictator, and has promised much to the changeling hives for their support. Unlike our government, the united hives do not have redundancies and there are many old rivalries that are held back by [CHN.GetLeader.GetHerHim] alone. Although risky and extreme, S.M.I.L.E. must do the unthinkable. [CHN.GetLeader] must be deposed, by any means necessary."
  SOL_new_imperial_chapter:0 "The New Imperial Chapter"
  SOL_new_imperial_chapter_desc:0 "With the dissolution of S.M.I.L.E., there is a gap that has been left in the Empire's defense, however, that role will still be filled, reborn as the Empress's [SOLGetAgencyName]. Unlike the old agency, it will be filled with loyal ponies who will not balk at the Empress's demands. Somepony suitably faithful must be chosen, so that the light of Harmony may be defended from all the hidden forces of Chaos."
  SOL_threats_without:0 "Threats from Without"
  SOL_threats_without_desc:0 "We are surrounded on all sides by those who wish to see Harmony and Order fall. Whether it be jealousy, hatred, or simply a desire for Chaos, the other nations are truly the greater threat to all of the Empress's plans. Focusing the [SOLGetAgencyName] to hinder dangers before they could ever destabilize our country is of highest priority."
  SOL_threats_within:0 "Threats from Within"
  SOL_threats_within_desc:0 "Although there are many dangers to Harmony and Order outside of our borders, we will not be able to defend ourselves if we allow dissidents to run rampant. These anti-social ponies, who desire nothing more than to see Chaos reign, will lead to the collapse of Order if they are not found and contained. Focusing all of the [SOLGetAgencyName]'s efforts on maintaining the peace of our realm should be imperative."
  SOL_demoralization_campaigns:0 "Demoralization Campaigns"
  SOL_demoralization_campaigns_desc:0 "While much of the [SOLGetAgencyName]'s efforts to thwart our foes will be undetectable, there are a number of ponies within the organization who are masters of spinning words and creating striking imagery. Therefore, creating a secondary wing dedicated solely for espousing the truth of our enemies' futility to fight against us will allow us to fight them on the physical and mental battlefield."
  SOL_funding_safety:0 "Funding for Safety"
  SOL_funding_safety_desc:0 "While S.M.I.L.E.'s budget was massively expanded under the old regime, it was not enough to protect from infiltration by numerous enemies of Harmony. The [SOLGetAgencyName] must not have limits on how much money it is given. If the Empire is to be protected and Harmony to be upheld, then there is no price too great for ensuring the Empress's enemies are stymied."
  SOL_subtle_propaganda:0 "Subtle Propaganda Campaigns"
  SOL_subtle_propaganda_desc:0 "As the [SOLGetAgencyName] is adept at subterfuge, there are other ways that it can maintain Order in our lands than simply disappearing them. Ponies may be stopped from thinking incorrect ideas altogether, if there is sufficient, convincing propaganda. Inside the agency, there are numerous ponies adept at prose and imagery. Employing them for innocuous messages of loyalty will go far in keeping Order."
  SOL_active_counter_wings:0 "Active Counter-Solar Wings"
  SOL_active_counter_wings_desc:0 "Throughout the world, there are numerous governments that wish ours to fall, but are not doing so overtly. Instead, they fund or otherwise support disgruntled ponies within our lands, fomenting dissent and sowing Chaos within our ranks. Although we can never truly stop the propaganda, we can create a wing of the [SOLGetAgencyName] for the sole purpose of stamping out these anti-Solarists with extreme prejudice."
  SOL_double_encryption:0 "Double Encryption Efforts"
  SOL_double_encryption_desc:0 "One never knows who might be listening to communications. As we all rely upon the same technology as many other nations, there always runs the risk that our standard cyphers are broken and our agents' movements discovered. To that end, applying a second, magical encryption layer to letters, radio messages, and more, will make it that much harder for our enemies to spy upon us."
  SOL_spy_nation:0 "A Nation of Spies"
  SOL_spy_nation_desc:0 "For us to be truly defended from threats to Harmony, we must rely upon even the civilian to be the eyes and ears of the Empress. The [SOLGetAgencyName] will be more active in recruiting capable ponies, but beyond that, simply encouraging all to serve the Empress in ways that are seen as less glamorous, that are less likely to receive public praise, will go far in supporting our intelligence community."
  SOL_pre_crime_arrests:0 "Pre-Crime Arrests"
  SOL_pre_crime_arrests_desc:0 "There are patterns in everypony's lives, and psychological indications of who may secretly harbor disloyalty to the Empress have become useful for the [SOLGetAgencyName]. While there are hiccups, the success rate of arresting ponies before they are at risk of anti-Order behavior has remained above fifty percent. Expanding the resources to utilize these psychological assessments will further keep Chaos from our Empire."
  SOL_return_elements_home:0 "Return the Elements Home"
  SOL_return_elements_home_desc:0 "One of the greatest embarrassments for the Empress is that the Element Bearers themselves have yet to submit to her. Rather than accept her englightenment, they fled for lands unknown to no doubt regroup and plan to overthrow her. They have been gone for far too long, and they are still welcome to accept her guidance. All they will need is to be brought home and for the sun to finally light their path."
  SOL_remove_evidence:0 "Remove the Evidence"
  SOL_remove_evidence_desc:0 "The last vestige of the old diarchy has proven a thorn in the Empress's side for some time. Princess Luna has remained a beacon of hope for those who wish to resist the Empress's rule. Although she has hopped from country to country, we have determined her current location, and we must remove her symbol as a symbol of rebellion. If the Empress's lowly sister can be silenced then her will shall be unchallenged."
  SOL_dragons_fire:0 "The Dragon's Fire"
  SOL_dragons_fire_desc:0 "While the Empress is bearer of the sun, the fire that she controls is but one aspect of the cleansing element. Kirin are unique. Their magic is disposed to pyromancy, far beyond what most unicorns could achieve. What these pony-adjecent creatures have must be studied, and not from afar. Agents will be dispatched to retrieve some. If we can find their secret for their nirik fire, the Empress's power will only grow."
  SOL_darkest_depths:0 "Unlock the Darkest Depths"
  SOL_darkest_depths_desc:0 "Deep within Magehold, there are hundreds if not thousands of tomes of knowledge long lost to Equus. While these are banned for a reason, that does not mean the Empress cannot contain the knowledge they hold. These distant lands must be plumbed, and our agents must retrieve the most valuable books they can find. It will simply be a matter of finding those who can stomach a bit of dark magic."
  SOL_steal_storms_thunder:0 "Steal the Storm's Thunder"
  SOL_steal_storms_thunder_desc:0 "When the Storm King was killed, his most prized possession, the Staff of Sacanas, was taken by one of his generals back to the crumbling kingdom's capital. As debfriefs from the Element Bearers and [EQS_fizzlepop.GetName] indicate, it was able to control the weather much like the pegasi. While it may be redundant, the yeti are not worthy of such magic, and having instant control of the weather will never hurt."

  SOL_reconquer_cry_desc:0 "[CRY.GetNameDef] has remained stubbornly independent and ignored our demands that they kneel to their superior. Just like in the ancient past, they believe themselves better off under their own rule and with their own ideas. But they are only wayward foals. They cannot escape the judgement of the Empress. The Burning Eye of the Sky shall see all their faults."
  SOL_pan_pony_empire:0 "Dreams of a Pan-Pony Empire"
  SOL_pan_pony_empire_desc:0 "Although the Empress is ruler of all that she surveys, there are ponies outside of the Empire have believe they do not need to bow to her. While we may be the homeland of ponies, the diaspora see her as nothing but quaint. However, the Empress is the Empress of ALL ponykind. To truly protect Harmony and Order, every last pony must be brought into the fold. Only then will her mission be complete."
  SOL_alicorn_weapons:0 "Technology of the Alicorns"
  SOL_alicorn_weapons_desc:0 "Alicorns are far and away above us in every aspect. Their magic is more powerful, their endurance is far higher, and their intelligence far greater than any common pony. Because of this, some have wished to request of the Empress tests with her own magic supplied. There are potential breakthroughs far beyond what can currently be dreamed if we can harness a fraction of her might for the future of our nation."
  SOL_reconquer_stg:0 "Homeland of Rebellion"
  #SOL_reconquer_stg_desc:0 "The misguided fools of [STG.GetName] have defied us for far too long. Their secession decades ago was but a stroke of luck and weakness, but now their great experiment comes to an end. Stalliongrad shall be Princessyn once more."
  SOL_reconquer_stg_desc:0 "As the homeland of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion, [STG.GetNameDef] has gone out of its way to defy us time and again. While they were able to seize the opportunity of the previous regime's weakness, their failed state only proves that without an alicorn to lead, ruin always follows. Their experiment ends today. The suffering of those underneath their fat leaders will be avenged. Stalliongrad will be Princessyn once again."
  SOL_core_cry:0 "A Personal Union"
  #SOL_core_cry_desc:0 "It is time to bring proper Imperial administration to the Crystal Lands, and to make sure that the populace knows their place."
  SOL_core_cry_desc:0 "Although an off-shoot of the original rulers' family, Mi Amore Cadenza gives a tie to the monarchy of [CRY.GetNameDef] for the Empress, one which will not be ignored nor held in contempt. It is time that the crystal ponies learn what it is like to live under a proper, [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] administration. They will bow the knee, and they will stay in line."
  SOL_core_stg:0 "Force a Bent Knee"
  #SOL_core_stg_desc:0 "The great socialist experiment ends - the misbegotten child of Marks and Steel Stallion. Their insidious structures shall be undone, society unravelled, pride and defiance crushed. All that will remain is another obedient province of the Empire."
  SOL_core_stg_desc:0 "The populace of [STG.GetNameDef] have been brainwashed, made to believe a lie that they are not subservient to the Empress. Filled with fables from the ideological venom of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion, they must be shown the error of their ways. Their corrupt and anti-Order ways will be undone, their society shattered, and their defiance destroyed. They will learn to love the Empress, one life at a time."
  SOL_conquer_chn:0 "Blight on the Land"
  #SOL_conquer_chn_desc:0 "The Changelings are an abomination, a very affront to Harmony that needs to be burned and crushed. They will never harm my ponies again."
  SOL_conquer_chn_desc:0 "[CHN.GetAdjectiveCap] society is the exact opposite of a perfect and orderly pony society. Every breath they take shows their abominable ways, as they are an affront to Harmony and Order that seeks to sap the very life out of the Empire's populace.\n\nOnly the Sun's flame can hope to cauterize their threat from the land."
  SOL_conquer_ole:0 "Pacify the Deer"
  #SOL_conquer_ole_desc:0 "The Deer of Olenia have lived in fear and uncertainty for too long as a result of weak leadership. It is only right for a powerful sovereign to assert themselves over those who require protection, and the Sun has plenty to spare."
  SOL_conquer_ole_desc:0 "[OLE.GetNameDefCap] is a weak, failing state that is in its death throes as the bastard child of its previous king sucks it dry of anything remotely useful. Although they are not ponies, the deer of [OLE.GetName] cry out for protection, and it is only right for a sovereign of strength and determination to provide it to them."
  SOL_conquer_drg:0 "Dragon Nuisance"
  #SOL_conquer_drg_desc:0 "The laughable [DRG.GetName] will be brought to the fold. The Dragons may breathe fire, but what good will it do against the Sun itself?"
  SOL_conquer_drg_desc:0 "[DRG.GetNameDefCap] once believed themselves to be the top of the food chain of dangers. Perhaps once, but now it is laughable. On their pathetic island, they hide away and comfort themselves with lies. Perhaps they can breathe fire, but what good will that do against the Sun itself? How can a tiny flame hope to extinguish a raging inferno?"
  SOL_conquer_grf:0 "Subjugate the Colony"
  #SOL_conquer_grf_desc:0 "The griffon colony has long languished in squalor and poverty, led by incompetent cronies and egotists. They are a threat to stability and Harmony, they need to be subjugated and pacified."
  SOL_conquer_grf_desc:0 "[GRF.GetNameDefCap] was an unlawful seizing of some of the most ancient land of ponykind by the contemptable Grover I. Since then, they have expanded, and now languish in abject poverty because of their incapable governors and incompetent lackies. Their corruption is an affront and threat to Harmony. A threat that will soon be removed."
  SOL_evict_hoarders:0 "Evict the Hoarders"
  SOL_evict_hoarders_desc:0 "Dragons have little intrinsic value, as they are greedy, selfish, and lazy. However, their land rests upon a number of rich mineral deposits, which is more than likely what attracted the earliest dragon lords to it in the first place. Why should they be allowed to sit on it, while our ponies require more resources for defending Harmony? It shall be ours soon enough."
  SOL_elite_laborers:0 "Elite Laborers"
  SOL_elite_laborers_desc:0 "A single dragon, even in its youth, is far stronger than the majority of earth ponies and can endure far greater punishment as well. When the first dragon lords claimed their island, it was more than likely because of the rich natural resources that the mountain contained. Why should we risk our own ponies' lives, when we have acquired scores of new laborers?"
  SOL_put_in_place:0 "Put Them in Place"
  SOL_put_in_place_desc:0 "Horrid creatures, changelings must be reminded again and again of where they stand upon the ladder of Equus. With Chrysalis's insolence, they believed themselves as the new masters of the continent. They will quickly learn that the Empress does not take kindly to upstarts who threaten Harmony."
  SOL_deserved_humiliation:0 "Deserved Humiliation"
  SOL_deserved_humiliation_desc:0 "When Chrysalis united the hives into a single entity, the largest hives and their queens lent their full support to her and have been eager collaborators since. While every changeling queen that aided Chrysalis deserves punishment, these four especially require a personal correction. Let them learn from the ash of their mistakes."
  SOL_deer_shipwrights:0 "Shipwrights of the Sun"
  SOL_deer_shipwrights_desc:0 "Hundreds of years ago, the deer of Olenia raided the coasts of our land in uniquely-built longboats, which were able to deftly avoid our less nimble and heavier armed ships of the time. Since the age of sail died, the proficiency to the sea has not left the Olenian spirit. As service for the Empress's protection, they should lend their knowledge to us."
  SOL_reclaim_seaddle:0 "Reclaim What was Ours"
  SOL_reclaim_seaddle_desc:0 "Just across the river from Vanhoover, the deer city of Seaddle has taunted us for centuries. At one point, this was pony-held, but even the specifics of how it was lost to the deer have been erased by the sands of time. However, one thing is certain: it was once ours, and we shall take it back. No matter how long deer families have lived there, it will be a pony settlement soon enough."
  SOL_industrial_heartland:0 "The Industrial Heartland"
  SOL_industrial_heartland_desc:0 "[153.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and the region it surrounded was heavily industrialized after the Industrial Revolution took hold on Equus. Although it did not reach the same heights as Manehattan or Fillydelphia, it was a significant loss when [STG.GetNameDef] revolted from our rule. In that time, they've further densified, and we should continue that trend for our own benefit."
  SOL_expand_reach:0 "Expand the Empress's Reach"
  SOL_expand_reach_desc:0 "Our northern coastline ends with the [241.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and until recently, has been under threat by both communist and colonist alike. Additionally, we do not have an easy way to protect our trade going to northern Griffonia, and it is too distant to project our influence into the Arctic Circle. However, the griffons settled on ancient pony land. It's time they return it, regardless of if they agree."
  SOL_island_vacation:0 "Island Vacation"
  SOL_island_vacation_desc:0 "[PCB.GetNameDef] begged for our protection and assistance in the wake of its revolution when Nightmare Moon returned, yet now that we instilled Order into society, they thumb their noses at us. While amusing that such an isolated island believes itself safe, they have been an irritant for too long. Their weather will prove a nice distraction from the harshness of other Equestrian regions."
  SOL_conquer_yak:0 "Smash the Yaks"
  #SOL_conquer_yak_desc:0 "The backwards Yaks are practically begging for guidance, with their constant bickering and fighting. It is a miracle that they haven't collapsed unto themselves after so long - let us see how their famed stubbornness matches against the might of the Sun."
  SOL_conquer_yak_desc:0 "Far to the north of our [CRY.GetAdjective] lands lies the home of the [YAK.GetAdjective]s, which has remained isolated for hundreds of years. These backward, primitive yaks have been bickering and striving against each other, to the point of almost collapsing their entire realm. They are practically begging to be stabilized. While they may be stubborn, it matters little against the fire of the Sun."
  SOL_final_insult:0 "The Final Insult"
  SOL_final_insult_desc:0 "Chrysalis, queen of the united changeling hives, has been a thorn in our side since her attempted conquest in 1002. While some creatures may see reason, and others will accept Harmony and Order, she is rabidly nationalistic and wishes to see nothing more than the destruction of our pony way of life. Her tyranny will not continue. Ultimately all will be cleansed in fire."
  SOL_yoink_more_land:0 "Take Yet More"
  SOL_yoink_more_land_desc:0 "Although Seaddle was the further reach of ponykind, why must we cease with our settlement? Vaverfront is a hub of industry and already partly accepts pony culture, and its nearby states can prove to be excellent locations for military bases. The deer were begging for our assistance, after all, it is time we are given some recompense for our struggles."
  SOL_tap_into_forests:0 "Tap into the Forests"
  SOL_tap_into_forests_desc:0 "[OLE.GetNameDefCap] has extensive swaths of unsurveyed land that is buried under snow and forest. Strangely, despite the deer's advanced, arcane technology, they have chosen to ignore these obvious points of exploitation and instead revere the nature of these environments.

  SOL_conquer_north:0 "Arctic Heatwave"
  #SOL_conquer_north_desc:0 "Bears and Penguins are an isolated, backwards species, but their land is worth more than their lives. To secure northern shipping routes and any minerals they are sitting on, they too will be brought to the Sun's great fold."
  SOL_conquer_north_desc:0 "In the Frozen North, there are yet more nations that have somehow eked out an existence. [PNG.GetNameDefCap] and [PLB.GetNameDef] are both isolated and technologically illiterate. While they carry little value to us, their land at least is ripe for prospecting, and we can further guard northern shipping routes. They will prove little difficulty in pacifying."

  SOL_delve_shelves_desc:0 "The griffons are not stupid, and with advancing techniques, have plumbed a number of oil wells within the Frozen North and the ice fields that stretch across their fringes. However, there are still areas in the sea that have not been fully explored. With the amount of black gold that has been already discovered, it is safe to assume there is more.

  SOL_establish_worker_hives:0 "Establish Worker Hives"
  SOL_establish_worker_hives_desc:0 "As life has gone on in the changeling lands after our conquest, some have begun to acclimate to our superior society.

  SOL_keep_pets:0 "Keep the Pets"
  SOL_keep_pets_desc:0 "The lackies of Chrysalis have proven to be quite useful, as each major hive has rebuilt and continued its specialized legacy from before unification. Since they are not as guilty as their previous leader, they should be permitted to aid in some aspects of administering the changeling lands. However, they will be kept on a short leash. Can't have the ants running the farm, after all."
  SOL_figurehead_monarch:0 "Figurehead of the Deer"
  SOL_figurehead_monarch_desc:0 "A problem that has routinely come up with administering the deer is that they have remained stubbornly independent, and frequently disobey or only follow the letter of the command they were given. Before our conquest, many yearned for the return of Velvet Jelzek, only legitimate heir. Although not a prisoner, she has remained under watch, and it is time we used her concern for her deer for our benefit."
  SOL_destroy_deer_monarchy:0 "Abolish the Pathetic Monarchy"
  SOL_destroy_deer_monarchy_desc:0 "Although the deer attempted to civilize through establishing a monarchy, currently led by House Jelzek, it is only a facade that they use to claim modernity. The monarchy has never effectively led [OLE.GetNameDef], and it is a wonder how the populace clings to any semblance of trust in it. Thus, why should pretenses be kept? House Jelzek is no more special than any other deer. All will be reminded of it."

However, every battle leaves behind wounded, and the victor has free rein to do as they wish with them.\n\nAs of this moment, little word has reached us of our own prisoners of war and what the changelings have done with them. So far, it doesn't appear that they have been used for disguises of infiltrators, but it is simply too hard to tell with S.M.I.L.E. completely overwhelmed with the sudden influx of intelligence from being in a hot engagement. Given the state of how Olenia was handled, though, it does not give us hope that our soldiers are being treated well.\n\nCurrently, we have tens of thousands of changeling POWs who are left doing menial labor as a way to at least supplement our still struggling industry. However, this has come at a cost. Escapes among the changelings is common, given that we have yet to determine an effective way to counter their shape-shifting abilities, and they can simply slip out with supply deliveries or when there is a changing of the guard. Additionally, the ponypower dedicated to protecting these camps could be used elsewhere if we decide to show the changelings the probable treatment that they are giving our own POWs.\n\nPrince Blueblood has left several proposals regarding how to more effectively handle this situation, although most of the military and government do not support his most... extreme ideas.\n\nHow we treat our aggressors may well shape the perception of the populace of others and the world of us once we are out of this war, but utilizing them more directly could prove more beneficial in the short term. The choice is yours, Princess."

  solarreworked.2.d:0 "Before the war, it was only theorized that magic could be tuned to a specific species of creature. With the increased funding in research and development that has arisen with recent reforms from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], renewed interest in possible ways to effectively halt a changeling advance have been pursued.\n\nVarious teams across [EQS.GetNameDef] have begun to invest into analyzing spells and how changeling tissue reacts to it, gathered from a few injured prisoners of war. Within the last couple of weeks, significant progress has been made, and the research team of Bunsen Beaker and Pinpoint in Bales have reported that they have had a breakthrough. By keying unique incantations into a spell, whether verbally or mentally, a caster can infuse various magical devices with properties that are extremely harmful to changelings.\n\nEffects vary, however, they have reported that from the chitin samples they have, and the cadavers they have acquired—with no explanation on how that happened—the damage ranges from inflicting gangrenous growths, melting large holes into shells, or complete and sudden spontaneous combustion. If refined, there could be further options for our mages and magi-technologists to utilize.\n\nIn response, this has raised voices from within the government and academia. As of yet, the changelings have yet to produce any bioweapons of their own that could be used to target our soldiers or civilians, but if we strike first with weapons like these, they could retaliate. If nothing else, it will lower our standing on the international stage.\n\nVoices such as Prince Blueblood, though, have argued that it would be better to strike first than to be struck instead. It could also be used in precision attacks on high-ranking officers and otherwise leave a changeling army broken at the sudden loss.\n\nThis slope is indeed a slippery one, and it is a decision that [ROOT.GetLeader] must make alone, as she has the final say."

With a growing bomber force, our longest-range planes no longer run support efforts for ground forces, but rather have been placed on strategic bombing duty to hinder the [CHN.GetAdjectiveCap] war machine.\n\nSo far, the initiative has had mixed success. Compared to the [CHN.GetAdjective] Luftwaffe, most of our bomber pilots do not have the experience nor the the ideological drive to perform the extended missions. While our industry and cities have been targeted equally, our pilots and high command have yet to approve responding in kind to the [CHN.GetAdjective]s. Our initial bomb raids were successful, as industry that was along the outskirts of cities or in the countryside were destroyed and rendered inoperable.\n\nWhen the [CHN.GetAdjective] noticed that the factories within their hives and cities remained intact, they began to move more of their war industry within, where they are surrounded by tens of thousands of civilians. Since then, our air force's effectiveness has dwindled, as pilots have either abandoned missions or were ordered off by high command.\n\nAs S.M.I.L.E. has determined, the [CHN.GetAdjective]s are continuing to move their industries within urban centers and populated areas, where there will no doubt civilian collateral damage. There are still some military targets within range, but those are becoming less common.\n\nDue to this change of the [CHN.GetAdjective] war machine, some within the high command are pushing for further training of pilots and rescinding any implicit stance on civilian casualties. Prince Blueblood and General Stronghoof have argued that the civilians care clearly accepting of [CHN.GetLeader]'s choices, and are therefore culpable, however, given [CHN.GetLeader.GetHerHis] authoritarian control of [CHN.GetNameDef], it is questionable if any can object.\n\nHowever, hampering the war effort could lead to less casualties overall, if supplies become an issue for the [CHN.GetAdjective].

Conscription has been far from popular and worker morale is still low, especially in retooled factories for producing weapons instead of consumer goods. As the war has gone on, this has become more apparent in cities that are distant from the conflict, simply because it can seem like an inconvenience rather than a threat.\n\nAlthough there have been campaigns in the past to encourage ponies to stay united, there has not been a section of government dedicated to producing material that will push ponies to do things they normally would not or to support activities that appear against being friendly or living in harmony.\n\nIt has been proposed that a Ministry of Morale be created for this exact purpose, to create a single message from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] until the war with [CHN.GetLeader] has concluded. While this will lead to some stifling of information, it is for the safety of the populace. Through hiding or manipulating information and statistics about the war, the MoM would craft campaigns that could be used to motivate ponies to sign up for frontline duty, improve conscript morale, or convince worker teams to do all they can to help.\n\nPrince Blueblood is in favor of this ministry's creation, but there are some who believe it could lead to further censorship down the line. What is your decision?"

  solarreworked.5.d:0 "Unlike other creatures, changelings are adept at infiltration and espionage due to their natural shape-shifting abilities. This fact has been a thorn in [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s side for generations, as only the city of Acornage has successfully had any peaceful, trustful relations between ponies and changelings. Although infrequent before the war, the occasional changeling infiltrator that was detected would always cause a stir within [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nHowever, it is clear that [CHN.GetLeader] has increased [CHN.GetLeader.GetHerHis] efforts of undermining the security of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. A recent case of a discovered infiltrator was when an engineer on one of our tank prototypes had been seeing a changeling disguised as an innocent mare. The changeling took months to gain his trust and be shown some of the blueprints of the tank.\n\nWhen the changeling determined the opportunity was right, she or he bound the engineer and stole the designs. Thankfully, the design had been drastically reworked shortly before and he had not been given a copy of the blueprints to work upon. However, it highlights S.M.I.L.E.'s official concern that the changelings will be easily gain access to any intelligence they desire. There is no telling how many infiltrators are currently within our borders, disguised as ponies they replaced.\n\nIn light of these national security concerns, S.M.I.L.E. has proposed a number of points that could be implemented for ensuring that our secrets are not exfiltrated. Some of them have been decried as extreme and invasive, however, S.M.I.L.E. has made clear that it is the only way to be safe. Mass surveillance, while unwieldy with our current level of technology and integration with magic, is possible, and would guard against many changeling attempts at infiltration.\n\nHowever, it is a cliff that could lead to quick erosion of rights for the ponies of [ROOT.GetNameDef] if it is not carefully implemented and immediately rescinded after the war's end. This is ultimately the call of [ROOT.GetNameDef]."

  solarreworked.6.d:0 "Since Adamant Smith published his book over a hundred and fifty years ago on the benefits of a capitalist, free market society, it has largely dictated the economic policy of [ROOT.GetLeader]. Although there has been hiccups, it has largely improved the quality of life of ponies, it is not perfect.\n\nThe trade that fed [ROOT.GetNameDef] in peace is now a liability. Since the war began, our supply lines with our overseas trade partners have been a popular target for the changeling Kriegsmarine, as their U-boats have been able to pick off many of our trade ships with impunity. As of yet, our navy has been unable to properly respond to the raids, and it has begun to starve some of our key industries of resources.\n\nA re-evaluation of whether adhering stringently to a free market economy is currently being undertaken. As [ROOT.GetNameDef] is a land filled with resources, some within the government have voiced their demands for less reliance upon our current trade partners. A few advocate for complete isolation from the international market, although they usually temper their demands by clarifying that it is only while we are at war with [CHN.GetNameDef].\n\nIf we were to close our trade ports completely, it would lead to multiple economic shocks throughout the nation, but it would permit us to fully utilize our natural resources without relying upon other countries for support. Certain raw materials are in short supply upon the continent, but we must consider how much we would receive if our entire trade fleet is sunk.\n\nOther economists have floated various compromises, while some still argue that the only viable course is maintaining the status quo.\n\nAll sides have valid points, and ultimately protecting the ponies of [ROOT.GetNameDef] may involve more than giving them bread and circuses. What will you decide, [ROOT.GetNameDef]?"

  solarreworked.7.da:0 "Holding back a sigh, Princess Luna rapped a forehoof on the heavy doors to Celestia's chambers. Both guards stationed at the entryway paid her no heed, but she could sense their worried gazes occasionally glance her way. When there was no answer behind the door, she gently inquired, "'Tia? May I enter?"\n\nStill silence.\n\nSensing the palpable strain in the air, Luna shifted briefly to one of the guards and nodded to door. He saluted. In a couple of seconds, the door was unlocked, and Luna trotted in. "'Tia?" she repeated, blinking a couple of times at the sight. Celestia merely stared off toward the city, her attention completely enraptured by the spires of Canterlot.\n\n"'Tia? Sister?" Luna moved closer. She caught Celestia mumbling under her breath. "Celestia?" Luna prodded firmly. When Celestia still didn't answer her, she snapped, "Sister!"\n\nPractically jumping out of her skin, Celestia jerked to the left to glare at Luna, her eyes burning with barely contained fury. When she saw Luna, her rage subsided, slightly. "Oh, Luna," she ultimately muttered. She didn't add anything further.\n\n"Dost thou—" Luna winced "—Know you why I'm here?"\n\nResting an elbow on her desk, Celestia eyed Luna, one of her brows just slightly wrinkled in suspicion. "Oh, I can guess." She snorted. "Blueblood. He put you up to this, yes?" With a wry laugh, she chortled, "I'm sure he's chomping at the bit to be given a better position in your new Equestria."\n\n"What?! Sister, pray tell why these lies pervade your head!" Stomping on the ground once, Luna raised her muzzle an inch. Mustering as much of their mother's confidence as possible, she declared, "I'm here to speak with you. You are my sister. You are in distress. I can feel it."\n\n"Am I, Luna?" Lolling her head to the side, Celestia visually sized up Luna and played with a quill that was resting on the desk. Back and forth. Twirl. Flip.\n\nShe continued until the end of the quill snapped, and she snarled, "I've never seen things more clearly. My ponies need my aid."\n\nFlapping her wings and flying forward, Luna skidded to just before the desk, and she declared, "That is exactly why I am here! You are not the sister that I know! Your smile and optimism have vanished!" She gestured to Canterlot. "Some of your new laws have harmed our ponies, not protected them!" Forcing back a couple of tears, she pressed down on the desk and pleaded, "Please, sister, cease and be still! Tarry a moment and think!""
  solarreworked.7.db:0 ""Your Majesty, we must speak. Now." Forcing back a nervous jitter, Fancy Pants stepped forward from the rest of the assembled privy council. Although they were not officially barring anypony from entering or leaving the throne room, they arranged themselves in such a way that it was clear they were to be left alone. To that end, the guards at the entrance slammed the doors shut with a heavy boom.\n\nAs the echo bounced around the throne room, Fancy Pants held back another shiver as he felt himself being visually accosted by Princess Celestia. Despite being across the chamber, she bored directly into him with her gaze, and it was like he was staring into the sun itself. Softly but firmly, Celestia asked from where she sat on her throne, "Do we now?"\n\nShe motioned for Raven Inkwell to depart. The unicorn bowed and left.\n\nWhen they were alone, Celestia yawned and stretched from the throne. Sauntering toward them with a steady, calculating gait, she asked, "And what, Minister Pants, is so important that we must speak 'now?'"\n\nHis voice faltered. However, he quickly recovered, and after glancing at a couple of his fellow council members, he declared, "We could not help but notice that you are, well, different, Princess."\n\n"Oh?" She titled her head. Despite it seeming innocuous, Fancy couldn't help but shudder, as he imagined himself as a bunny being toyed with by a cat that had caught it.\n\nStill, he stood straight. Ponies depended on him, and on top of that, he was doing what was right. "Yes," he stated, what fear in his voice leaving and being left with a resolved calmness. Looking pleadingly into her eyes, he stepped forward and pressed a hoof to his chest. "You are unlike yourself, Princess. I understand that it is difficult without your sister, but you have taken on too much of a burden." He pointed out one of the windows to the throne room. "These laws that you believe necessary, they're hurting ponies. They're failing to protect anypony! We firmly request that you reconsider them."\n\nWith a small flash of frustration, he marched closer to her, his monocle catching the light. For a moment, she looked at him, a brief spark of anger appearing on her features. "Please, Princess, listen to us. You need not shoulder the burden of leadership alone.""

  solarreworked.20.d:0 "Some days, Rose Thorn questioned why he woke up in the morning. And today was one of those days.\n\nIf he wasn't so terrified, he'd probably sigh, smack himself across the face, and then tell himself to shut up and deal with the card hoof that life had dealt him. Instead, though, he merely stared, quivering and shivering, into the burnt-yellow eyes of the alicorn who was no more than ten feet away from him.\n\nAdorned in bronze armor plating across her chest and head, she stood confidently, casually, seductively, in the square outside of Canterlot Castle. Her molten mane rippled in a non-existent breeze and occasionally launched off globs of matter onto the ground. The little bits sizzled and spat as they cooled.\n\nNormally, that position meant he was going to have a quiet day, but apparently life had decided otherwise. Maybe those preachers about the Great Faust were right, and she was a prankster, just like Princess Celestia. But that alicorn was simply standing there. Threateningly.\n\nEven though he could have shot her, she didn't seem perturbed. When she had appeared in a flash of fire, she had caused many of the civilians to scatter, but now a few were beginning to poke their heads out of businesses into which they fled. She sneered, baring fangs in a pleased manner.\n\n"My little ponies!" she began, her voice instantly turning his blood to ice. It was Celestia's voice! But she couldn't be the Princess. She was so... different!\n\nShe cast her gaze around the street outside the castle, and spread her wings wide, in a gesture of openness. "Witness today your salvation! Witness Equestria's rebirth! Witness your Sun, in the flesh!" She received nothing but stunned silence.\n\nThorn fiddled with his gun. There was no way in Tartarus that this was Celestia. It had to be a changeling trick! Or... maybe Celestia had fallen to the same thing Luna did. Even the thought of it made his knees quake. However, he raised his gun, which caught his CO's eye.\n\nHis commander nodded. He also started to line up his gun sights.\n\nSeemingly oblivious, the alicorn proclaimed haughtily, "Today, you shall know that Daybreaker Sun—" She cut herself off. At the same time, both Thorn and his CO opened fire. Igniting her horn, Daybreaker summoned a shield of flame, and the bullets bounced harmlessly off.\n\nShe whipped her head around.\n\nThorn wasn't paid enough for this."

  solarreworked.21.d:0 "Pursing her lips, Daybreaker hummed as she watched a couple of servants shift her sole throne further toward the center of the dais in the throne room. She squinted. After a couple of seconds, she clicked her tongue and stated, "No, to the left. More." She indicated with a hoof where the two servants should go.\n\nWith the castle secured after she had induced the loyalty of one of the guard companies, she had the time to adjust the place to her like. After all, with Luna out on the field, she had completely free rein. Where her "dear" sister would go and what would eventually be the consequence of her inevitable stab in the back, that would have to be seen to.\n\n"Y-Your Majesty," a guard stuttered as he entered the throne room. He shifted uncomfortably on his hooves. "The Royal Privy Council has convened—"\n\n"Stop dawdling, boy!" a refined, masculine voice declared before a tall, middle-aged stallion in a suit jacket stalked out from behind. In the stallion's wake, a few other nobles entered. Daybreaker arched a brow coyly.\n\n"Fancy Pants," she purred. "What a pleasure."\n\n"Princess Celestia, I'm afraid that we have all come to an agreement," Fancy began, although she caught his voice hitch slightly when he rested his gaze on hers. Some of the confidence in his expression drained. "W-We must ask that you relieve yourself of the throne, until this threat is over and you can get the—"\n\n"No."\n\n"'No?'" Fancy echoed. He exchanged confused glances with the other nobles. "You vested us the ability to make this decision when you—"\n\n"I said, 'no.'" Daybreaker shook her head. Trotting back to her throne, she sat down, haughtily, and practically goaded him to respond. "Do you believe you have the will to win, Fancy?" When he was silent, she added, "To make the most difficult choices for the benefit of MY ponies?!"\n\nHe replied with nothing. Finally clearing his throat, he stammered, "Y-You are not making 'difficult choices'! What is difficult about enacting a citywide lock-down?! What is difficult about arresting 'suspected' spies?!"\n\n"Oh, everything. Just like it'll be difficult to say, 'You're fired.'" She leaned in and sneered. "Have anything to say, Fancy?" As she did, a pair of guards moved in on the cabinet, and Fancy's last fragments of assurance shattered. She pulled back and chuckled. "I thought not.""

  solarreworked.22.d:0 ""Out of my sight!" Prince Blueblood snapped as a meek servant retreated from his quarters and slammed the door shut tightly. Outside the window of his prefabricated command post, he could see the servant galloping away to the mess tent. Was it too hard to simply get some acceptable coffee for the nights spent mapping out offensives?\n\nSighing, he cradled his forehead in his front hooves while he stared at another series of maps, one with positions of his troops, one with positions of the enemy based on previous intelligence. Of course, that was days old, so the situation could be anything at this point.\n\nWith no communication from Canterlot, his predicament was only more headache-inducing. If he was cut off from the rest of the high command, that made it that much more challenging to effectively plan counter-assaults. And he was the one who wanted this job...\n\nAs he massaged his temples, he heard a faint scream, which made him look up before the door to his quarters was jostled by a red glow of magic. Before he could call out that the door was locked, it caved in, and he whipped his pistol up at the intruder, before his mind halted for a second at the shape in the doorway. "Auntie?" he inquired.\n\nStill holding his pistol in his magic, he narrowed his eyes. It was almost like Celestia, but her appearance, her demeanor, were different. Stronger.\n\nCelestia rolled her eyes. "Put that down, Blueblood." When he hesitated, she snarled and snatched the gun before heating it to the point of a white-hot glow. As the heat radiated off it as it melted, he grimaced and she stalked in. "I thought you'd be excited to see your aunt." She snickered.\n\n"What are you?!" he stammered. His eyes searched for an escape route.\n\nCelestia looked to her peytral, then back to Blueblood. "Do you like it?" She inhaled. "It feels so invigorating. So freeing." She grinned. "So enlightening." Tilting her head, she inquired, "Which is why I came to see you, Blueblood." He remained quiet. "I think you're smart enough to see that Celestia, my naive alter-ego, was on the losing side." She rubbed her chest. "I, myself, Daybreaker Sun, can offer you a chance at revenge. And all the power that brings!" Sticking out a hoof, she sneered at him. "I hope you can see the light of this offer.""

Around her, about a dozen other soldiers also resided, each as eerily mute as her. Normally, a bit of small talk was necessary to keep the morale up as they were hauled from one place to the next. Seeing ponies that one grew attached to disappear forever required some humor to keep oneself from cracking under the pressure, but this time, there was no chance of revelry.\n\nEven her CO, Peytral, was abnormally grim. She briefly glanced up from her front hooves, which she had wrapped around her rifle, and met his pained gaze from across the truck bed. Out the back of the truck, through the tarp keeping the sun off of them, she could see the rest of the convoy headed to Fillydelphia. Already they had passed through some of the outskirts.\n\nIt was still so quiet.\n\nThe orders were simple. They had a rebellion to quell. But shouldn't there have been at least some activity? Where were the riots? Where were the rebels on the streets, trying to fight back? She and her company had been on the road for the last few hours, and they'd had no resistance.\n\nFillydelphia had claimed Princess Celestia had "gone insane" and was now actively working against Equestria. But those orders...\n\nBefore she could finish her thought, the truck came to a halt. Its breaks squealed as it jostled on its carriage, and Peytral barked into the stillness, "Out! Everypony out!"\n\nOn instinct, Cherry obeyed, grabbed her rifle, gripped it tightly, and hopped onto the cobblestone beneath her. As soon as she rounded a bend, she saw what had stopped them. A large barricade erected from broken police cars. On the other side, she saw a couple of ponies, dressed in civilian clothes, shakily aiming some rifles at the convoy.\n\nPeytral marched ahead of the squad. He didn't hesitate. "By decree of Daybreaker Sun, the Light of Equus, you must surrender and accept your judgement, as determined by her! Do not scorn her mercy, for her wrath is to be feared!" He sighed as he finished, and bit his lip.\n\nSeconds ticked down. When the civilians didn't answer, and instead tried to aim, he grunted. "Aim!" he bellowed.\n\nRed Cherry swallowed, brought her rifle up, and closed her eyes as he yelled, "FIRE!""

Even in our military, which should be loyal to protecting Equestria and Harmony—which she represents—to the bitter end, there are rumblings of discontent and outright mutiny. Many of the rank and file soldiery wish for simply a paycheck, especially as the cloud of war hangs heavy over Equus, but they, along with their commanding officers, have been slow to accept the command of Blueblood after it was discovered he had sworn complete fealty to Daybreaker.\n\nRumors have abounded that some within the military have sought to overthrow him, so that it can join with clandestine elements to attempt to "free Equestria" from the so-called iron grip of Daybreaker. But, some within have also pledged their allegiance to whatever orders that come from Canterlot, and it has presented an opportunity. While we do not know who is disloyal, they do not know who has sworn their lives to Daybreaker.\n\nAlthough the closest members who are within Blueblood's employ cannot be seen near any soldiers, that does not mean that he or Daybreaker directly cannot contact other loyal elements. Already, some have been via transfers by lower-ranking officers to watch for any untoward, unharmonic behavior within companies.\n\nOnly recently, it has been revealed that the commanding officer of the Golden Sunrise Battalion had been consorting with a recent group of nobles in Manehattan. Not only has the informant been promoted by Daybreaker, but the officer in question has received a personal visit. Currently, the official statement was that she found him doused in gasoline and on fire, an obvious suicide from his guilt.

We're back, live in Manehattan, to—" He nearly cut himself off as his mind stumbled over his next few words. Despite all his prep, he felt like his throat was drying up and his brain was running on empty. He breathed deeply. While his heart still thudded in his chest, he got mentally back on track. "To speak about what's going on out there."\n\nHe ruffled, furled, and unfurled a few sheets of paper on this recording desk. "You've all been writing in to me, asking what can be done about... everything. You're all seeing loved ones arrested or killed. The sky seems to be falling. There's no end in sight, right?"\n\nFor a couple of seconds, he paused to let the tension build. Staring into the mic, he barely noticed a commotion of noise from the floor below his studio. However, he did spot the nervous glances a couple of his crew shared between each other. He cleared his throat.\n\n"Well, I'm not a politician, but there are a few things that you can do." He tapped on the table. "One, make sure that you're there for each other. Can't do much good if you're all separated and scared. Two, reach out to friends and see how you can work together. Organize.

With a stammer and cough, he staggered back when a couple of soldiers aimed their guns at him.\n\n"Wh-What's going on?!" he finally demanded. He glanced at the mic. It was still very much live.\n\n"You've been found guilty of harboring anti-Harmony sentiments and encouraging them in others," one of the soldiers stated as he marched to the board that controlled the radio station.

In the dim lighting of the ersatz training room within the Imperial Palace, her mane cast shadows that danced across the walls from crates, half-assembled weapons and armor racks, and a partly-built fighting arena. Although some small hints of sunlight leaked through the blinds which had been pulled across the windows, it was as pitch-black as it could be with her presence.\n\nPainted in the orange and red glows of her mane, Prince Blueblood glared at her, his uniform long-ditched to allow him more freedom of movement. Across his body, a few welts and scorch marks could be discerned. Sweat poured down his brow. Despite his haggard appearance, Daybreaker could practically feel the frustration radiating off him. Every stab he took at her was sudden, heavy, and emotion-driven.\n\nWhile she kept her face stoic, she couldn't help but let out a single scoff as Blueblood feinted and attempted to stab her in the side. It was an obvious move, so she simply brought her wing up to block it. The sword clanged off the armor reinforcing her wing's bone, and she quickly retaliated with a small burst of magic. By now, it was almost like toying with him.\n\nClicking her tongue, Daybreaker chided, "Nephew, nephew, what did they teach you at military school? Do you wish to bore me to death?" At that, Blueblood took a couple of paces back and inhaled sharply. Daybreaker smirked as he sized her up. She tsked. "Why have I been giving you personal lessons all these weeks?" Sighing, she folded her wings to her side and trotted toward him. "Perhaps it was a mistake to leave the military to you. You're too inflexible. Too rigid."\n\nAt that, Blueblood tensed and then grunted, "And who says I can't learn, Auntie?" Focusing his magic, he disappeared in a blink of golden light and Daybreaker caught the ping of magic behind her. Rotating on her back hooves, she barely kept the blade he wielded from pressing against her neck.\n\nMeeting Blueblood's gaze, Daybreaker tittered. "My, you let me monologue. Clever." Effortlessly, she repulsed him with a small bump of magic, but not before he kicked, landing a direct hit into her chest. She coughed as the air rushed out of her lungs.\n\nAs she staggered back to regain her breath, she glanced at him. He wiped his brow. "That was your plan?" she wheezed before shaking her head.\n\nHe shrugged. "I winged it.

The quill which she held in her magic quivered and danced as she scribbled a few things onto one of the papers. Daybreaker couldn't make out what she had written.\n\nAfter waiting a few more seconds, Daybreaker leaned forward, her brow furrowed, and she repeated, "Raven."\n\nFinally looking up from her work, Raven blinked a couple of times and she gave a more proper bow. "Forgive me, Pri—Empress," she declared. Floating up the paper again, she wriggled it a couple of times for emphasis. "I have to get these finished up by today, with your signature, so that the budget can be passed and—"\n\nDaybreaker waved a hoof dismissively. "Surely that can wait a few minutes?" As a smile passed along her muzzle, she added, "Besides, I would say what I summoned you here for is far more important than—" She glanced at the parchments "—Whatever budget needs passing."\n\n"You say that, but..." Raven muttered before trailing off and jotting down a couple more items on the paper. Momentarily lowering them so that she could look at Daybreaker, Raven brushed aside some of her mane which had fallen in front of her eyes and stated, "I'm listening to you, Empress. I always listen."\n\nDaybreaker snorted. Steepling her hooves together, she narrowed her gaze momentarily. "Very well." She tapped her forehooves together. While her mane briefly flashed hotter, she sighed and stated, "You've been by my side for many moons, Raven. You've always handled anything I've given you faithfully." Shifting to sit straighter, Daybreaker concluded, "And I would like to reward that. How does becoming administrator of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and the palace sound? Complete run of the mill."\n\nRaven merely grunted. She flicked her quill across the pages in her grip.\n\n"Of course," Daybreaker quickly tacked on, "you will be expected to continue the rest of your responsibilities. I trust that's doable?"\n\n"Yes, Empress. I can begin those as soon as I finish here..." mumbled Raven. She turned to leave, and Daybreaker dismissed her. As she was leaving, though, she looked up and blinked a couple of times while nickering in surprise, before the doors slammed shut behind her."

  solarreworked.28.d:0 "Allowing the heat of the twin falls of lava in her throne room to wash over her, Daybreaker propped a hoof up on one of the armrests and bared her teeth cockily when entrance burst open. A pair of soldiers, stomping and straining as their charges struggled in their grip, marched toward the dais on which Daybreaker's throne rested. With a small titter, Daybreaker watched the two mares that were being dragged in continue to resist.\n\nAlmost instantly as they entered the heat of the room, the soldiers began to sweat, as did the prisoners. Their fur practically glistened, while Daybreaker barely felt warm at all. She got up when the two mares were thrown to the ground, and the soldiers departed. The doors slammed shut. As the boom echoed through the chamber, one of the mares glanced back, terror etched on her face as she struggled to get up.\n\nDaybreaker clicked her tongue and lit her horn. Instantly, red magic formed around the legs of the mares, and the one that had begun to climb slammed back onto the floor. She whimpered when her jaw smacked into the marble underneath the carpeting.\n\nAfter a few seconds, Raven Inkwell silently entered, her mane frizzing up slightly at the heat. Daybreaker leaned down to one of the mares and clucked in a disappointed tone. "Now, now, isn't it a tad rude to try and leave without introducing yourselves?" She glanced between both of the mares. Both shivered and whimpered, their eyes wide with fear.\n\nDaybreaker tsked. Glancing to Raven, who was flipping through a few papers on a clipboard, she asked, "What are their crimes, Raven? Have they been seen consorting with rebels?"\n\n"A couple of witnesses claim that they provided food to the Manehattan resistance, but they have alibi—"\n\n"Guilty," Daybreaker interjected, which earned a curious eyebrow raise from Raven, and whines from the mares. Glowering and towering over the mares, she snarled, "I cannot even risk collaborators with ponies that wish Harmony to fall!" Her horn ignited in a bright burst of crimson. "Enjoy the dungeons. You won't have long to be in them."\n\nBefore either mare could protest, Daybreaker's magic engulfed them, and they disappeared in a pop of magic. Glancing up at Raven, Daybreaker inquired, "Who's next? Solving crimes is rather... gratifying."\n\nHurriedly flipping through the pages on her clipboard, Raven stated, "A pony who has been under arrest for weeks because he was supposedly seen helping a changeling feed on love."\n\nDaybreaker rubbed her hooves together. "Guilty, obviously. I still want to see his face, though." She tittered. "Surprise and guilt is always such a fun mix of emotions to see.""

  solarreworked.29.d:0 ""Name," the tired voice of the civil servant before Bees Knees demanded. When Bees didn't immediately respond, the pony sighed and nursed her forehead momentarily with a hoof. Only the flickering candlelight and pair of wall sconces with torches illuminated her, dancing shadows across her face and making her appear like a haggard skeleton of a pony.\n\nPerhaps the mare was.\n\nStill too stunned to fully reply, Bees stammered simply a couple of times and the mare huffed, "If you want the official record to be 'uh-hu-uh' then I can make it that." She started to scribble something into her large tome, and Bees quickly snapped to his senses. Holding out a hoof, he demanded she stop and gave his proper name.\n\nThe mare jotted it down. After a few seconds, she nodded when the ink dried and asked, "And you know why you are here?" She gestured behind herself at the numerous other desks, where similar bureaucrats and citizens were performing the same song and dance.\n\nBees rolled his eyes. "Hmm, was it my excessive generosity?"\n\n"You've been convicted of breaking curfew, deceiving military police, and poor hedge trimming." Resolutely, she straightened some other papers on her desk, shimmying them together by rapping them lightly on its surface. Some of the light in the room glittered off the polished wood.\n\n"I went out for a walk, and I've been busy with work, okay?" he declared with a shrug. Every fiber of his being strained to take that book and smash it over her head, run, and be done with it, but that also ran the chance of being shot, so overall, it was unadvised. Especially since there were a number of armed guards within the room, from what he could discern.\n\nBriefly scrutinizing Bees, the mare huffed and clapped her hooves. "The laws are clear. Subsection E, Paragraph Seven, Subparagraph Three-C of [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] law: Delinquents and dissidents of lower degrees will be subject to fifty weeks community service, as decided by local magistrate—that's me—followed by public execution for crimes."\n\nAs soon as the words left the mare's mouth, Bees' heart sank, and he swallowed heavily. Flashing a smile, he quipped, "But you can lay off the second part of that, right? I-I'll be a good worker, I promise! No more curfew breaking and all that." He forced tears into his eyes. "Please?"\n\nWorking her jaw for a second, the mare looked at him, then stamped a piece of paper. She hefted it to him. Seeing the seal of [ROOT.GetLeader] on it, as well as the word "Execution" in bold, he looked up and whined.\n\n"No," was her only response. "Enjoy labor camp!""

  solarreworked.30.d:0 ""Auntie, you wished to see me?" Prince Blueblood inquired as he cautiously cantered into Daybreaker's personal chambers. Both guards on either side of the entrance had eyed him as he approached, but they remained unmoving even when he opened the door without first being allowed in. Although they might have permitted him entrance, he felt their eyes boring holes through his head. If he had provided so much as an inkling of suspicion between them, he'd probably have had a gaping wound in his chest before he could react.\n\nFor a moment, Daybreaker sat silently at her desk. Over her, an orange banner, emblazoned with wings protecting the sun, hung proudly across the entire wall behind her. Despite the current open doors of her balcony, the temperature within her chambers were easily five to ten degrees warmer compared to the hallway. Twin busts of herself sat on either side of her bed, which had been adorned with golden lace sheets.\n\nBlueblood simply waited. From the stern expression on his aunt's face, holding one's tongue was the intelligent option. Despite it all, his chest inwardly burned from being recalled from the field. If it was another one of her tests, his tongue most likely would end up controlling itself.\n\nLightly floating up a paper that was the top of a large stack, Daybreaker briefly skimmed it, and she inquired, "Tell me, Blueblood, my nephew, do you love me?"\n\nStuttering, Blueblood replied, "W-Why would I not? You've given me—"\n\n"Hmm, then what about these?" she interjected. At that, she whipped the paper around and passed it to him. He took it and his eyes scanned the lines upon it. "Curious, are they not?" she inquired with a tilt of her head. As he was engrossed in the paper, he failed to notice her mane grow a hotter yellow.\n\n"These are just some of my personal assets, Auntie, I-I don't see—" Before he could finish, Blueblood flinched when Daybreaker pounded her desk.\n\n"Do not play with me, Blueblood!" snapped Daybreaker, her mane flashing a bright blue momentarily. Leaning forward with her teeth bared, she snarled, "These are assets within MY enemies' territory. An estate within Severyana?! Stock within Hellheim Industries?! Bonds to Vraks?!" She growled. "I am not a fool!"\n\nAs Blueblood cringed back, his heart pounding in his chest, she returned to her seat. Steepling her hooves, she stated, "But I am not a monster." In a flash, she she materialized a radio transmitter and microphone onto her desk. It crackled to life. Passing the mic to Blueblood, she quipped nonchalantly, "Perhaps these were before I ascended and you forgot them. Therefore, you have one chance. These physical assets must be burned." She frowned. "And YOU will give the order. Am I clear?"\n\nShe gestured to the stack of papers. "The intangible assets can be dealt with afterward. But first, you must prove you prefer me more than your wealth." As Blueblood continued to gawk at her, his blood ran cold and he swallowed. She merely arched a brow. "You DO choose me over them, do you not, nephew?"\n\nGulping, Blueblood hesitantly took the mic, and nodded. Daybreaker smiled."

After a couple of seconds, there was a soft click and she stepped back. Her warm mane glistened off the polished stonework, and she briefly smirked at her reflection in the gold as the doors slid into the walls. Beyond, only darkness greeted her, but almost immediately burst into glorious day as a number of enchantments in the wall activated.\n\nGlittering light, as bright as her sun, poured from gems set into the wall, and she casually waltzed in, taking a moment to bask in the silence of the room. Casting a red glow on the hidden doors, she mentally flicked them back whence they came, and they boomed shut behind her.\n\nEverywhere she laid eyes upon, there were rows upon rows of weapons, spell books, or matrices infused with magic. Most of the items, though, were little more than knickknacks, gifts to her over the centuries. Etched swords and finely forged warhammers hung from racks, and various half-assembled suits of armor lay upon the floor and on mannequins. All but two.\n\nStanding in the center, a golden set of breastplate, wing guards, helmet, and armored shoes caught the magical lights, reflecting it back into her eyes. She sighed and briefly traced a hoof across its form, but shook her head. Protection from another era. While perfectly crafted and fit for modern combat, it wasn't her.\n\nYet next to it...\n\nShe grinned.\n\nLike her, it radiated heat, its dark bronze also bouncing the orange glow of her mane along with the light in the armory. Emblazoned on its chest piece, which was of a far thicker metal than her old armor, was a sun embraced by a pair of wings. Beautiful. Elegant. Refined. Like her.\n\nOutside, she caught the tromp of some of her soldiers marching by, completely ignorant of her presence. She snorted. They were little more than foals, unable to think clearly for themselves. Sheep-like, in a way.\n\nIf not for her, Harmony would have fallen so long ago, but leading from the back lines could only bring about so much. With enemies still on the horizon. There was little choice in the matter.\n\nSliding the helmet of the new suit on, she flared her nostrils. Ponykind would follow her. Against the bugs, against the communists, against the very fires of Tartarus itself. Let her enemies come. They'd only meet the heat of her sun in response."

When Princess Luna returned, there was a clear line of succession if something were to ever happen, but she is not suited to lead our land now, nor would she wish to. In the past, ideas of a regency council have been floated, but every time they were shot down, and [ROOT.GetLeader] has emphatically refused to agree to one for the one thousand years she has led [ROOT.GetNameDef] by her lonesome.\n\nWhile we do not expect her to perish, at the same time, it would be unwise to not have a formalized path in the unlikely event that she is wounded and unable to effectively lead until she heals. Given that Princess Luna's flight has left [ROOT.GetNameDef] in uncertain territory again, the matter should be pressed. It is not as if [ROOT.GetLeader] lacks ponies who know her well and would faithfully serve her, and who could use the power of being the official, designated regent to great effect."

With a small sigh, she ruffled her wings and caught the light clack of the metal guards on them as they shifted. The din of conversation carried toward her, whisked along on the wind that was softly blowing through the main square in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Countless ponies filled the area, their murmurs and mutters mixing together into a slurry of words and grunts. Some were watching Daybreaker, others flitted attention between their companions and paid her no mind.\n\nBasking in the confusion and tension for a brief moment, Daybreaker inhaled and sneered. She focused on her mane. Shortly, the typical orange that it held brightened to an almost eye-searing blue, so brilliant was its radiance. Further heat poured from her, which caused her nearby guards on the dais to flinch away and cover their faces. A few of the closest rows of ponies gasped and tried to backpedal.\n\nAfter a moment, she sauntered up to the empty podium on the dais, and she scanned the crowds. Orange banners with the same emblem on her armor hung from the sills and windows of the buildings surrounding the square, creating a blazing hot appearance. They fluttered in the wind.\n\n"My little ponies, we have struggled together to protect Harmony. We have bled, we have shed tears, we have sacrificed for its survival. Together, we attempted to usher in a new era of peace." She barred her fangs. "But some wished to see our strength undone! For months, we have all been plagued by these rebels hiding in plain sight. They have turned brother against sister, mother against child!" Stomping a hoof on the ground, she added, using magic to amplify her voice to carry across the entire square without issue, "Today marks the end of these dissidents! Harmony is no longer in danger from within!\n\n"You may fear my new appearance, but know that I have never lost my resolve! Harmony will endure! Equestria will be rebuilt and made prosperous! It will be reorganized into the first Solar Empire! United, the sun will never set upon our Harmony!" As a few flecks of spit flew from her mouth, she thrust out a hoof and exclaimed, "Praise to Harmony! Praise to me! PRAISE TO THE SUN!

Cliques in the government have opened up, as some officials have fallen in with Daybreaker, while others have refused to work as protest for the "un-harmonic" tasks they are no being given.\n\nThe military has been racked with mutinies and a conscription crisis in the aftermath of the revelation of Celestia. Squads and entire armies have gone dark or refused to accept orders from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], as many officers still remain "loyal" to the ideas of old [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nPonies at large have split into two groups, with the majority still favoring the old ways of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. Large-scale strikes have led to missed quotas and violence breaking out between harmonist supporters and our own loyal ponies. Furthermore, there is indication of active, and growing resistance, fueled by the status quo autonomy that regions experienced before Daybreaker's ascension. It will be critical to centralize society and the military around Daybreaker, or all our efforts of survival will be for naught and Harmony and Order will be expunged from Equus forever."

Enough of the military has been expunged that there is little risk of revolt or complete mutiny, but there are still whispers of sedition within the ranks.\n\nInternally, the wheels of government have been running smoother since Daybreaker has implemented a number of new laws and investigative powers to her loyal guards. However, there are still irregularities that have yet to be traced, and there are likely still a number of bureaucrats within [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that maintain hidden sympathies with the old, misguided regime and the antiquated idea of Harmony it held.\n\nRumors also abound that Twilight Sparkle's former protege, Starlight Glimmer, as well as her friend, Trixie Lulamoon, have established a large guerilla movement in the wake of our cleansing of those that would actively resist us. Although it is hearsay, there is still a movement that has yet to be pinpointed that has struck out at a number of our factories and military bases. The damage inflicted can be repaired, but it's kept our populace on edge, and continues to make us appear ineffective in stamping out the last of the former zeitgeist.\n\nIf this societal wound is allowed to fester, it will only get worse. We must find a way to ascertain who is this self-styled Harmonic Resistance's leadership is, and cut off the head. Until we do, there is always the risk that they will capitalize on a moment of weakness or distraction."

In response, the Empress has implemented heavy curfews and large-scale repression of the thestral populace, but it has not had the intended effect of quelling their sedition. If anything, it's aggravated it.\n\nRecent operations by our troops have met with fierce opposition and led to numerous lost lives on what should be a simple occupation and pacification. Attempts at driving out the thestrals have thus far hit brick walls as settlers have been ousted from villages and towns, with or without escorts. Some have reportedly been slain by the thestrals, but that has yet to be proven. Our populace, however, is growing increasingly tense around the thestral problem, as it's been called, and a final solution needs to be presented.\n\nUltimately they are fighting a losing battle, as they are surrounded on all sides by loyal ponies who wish to see Harmony protected. However, they have thus far proven willing to fight for what they perceive as their land and rights. At the moment, desire among the populace has been split in half. Some wish for us to fully commit to a military operation and seize whatever land we can and expel the rest. Others simply want to make peace with the thestrals, as they claim they are ponies like us, and that they could contribute.\n\nThere are a few voices on the thestral side that desire amicable relations, but there are many more who rightly understand that they are antithetical to Harmony and Order and see no path for reconciliation.\n\nBefore the nation is burned to the ground from within, there must be a path chosen, but ultimately, that lies within the hooves of the Empress alone."

Outside, she caught the first cries and high-pitched warning shrieks of other thestrals as the alarm was raised.\n\nMulti-pitched chitters carried through the sky, as the flap of leathery wings signaled the militia in her village fleeing to their abodes for their own weapons. She merely glanced out one of the windows, and saw the forest of Hollow Shades swallowing up most of the sunlight. She had only caught a glint of metal as [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] trucks wound through the forest trail toward her hometown, but it was enough for her to squeal the first alert, and then the rest was history.\n\nShe finished feeding bullets into the fixed magazine of her rifle, and slid the bold shut. After checking it was sliding properly, she flitted out and into the low-key gloom of the town. Almost immediately, she heard a gunshot, and glanced over to see another thestral had fired at the approaching convoy. Within seconds, that thestral ducked, although not before a spray of blood flew from his shoulder.\n\nHe whinnied in pain, and Lily screeched in shock. Almost hyperventilating at the sight, she smacked herself with a wing and dove for cover around a building. Closing her eyes and counting to five, she peeked out and pulled the trigger at the nearest truck-like shape she could see. There was a ricochet of a bullet on the wall protecting her, but she caught the clunk of her shot impacting, and seconds later there was an explosion that rocked her backward.\n\nAs a plume of fire carried into the sky, she pumped the air with a hoof. The Solarist invaders wouldn't be hauling them off this time, anyway. She poked her head over again, and fired, only to have her world filled with searing pain as she was suppressed by a volley of gunshots.\n\nThe trucks were beginning to unload, and in her haste, she had been scored in the shoulder. Whimpering as the blood gushed out of her wound, she collapsed and barely noticed as her fellow militia were pushed back. As she flashed in and out of consciousness, she saw a set of hooves approach, and somepony tut, "Another resister, captain.

Most of it was in different shades of grey.\n\nFlicking some of the dust that hung in the entrance's air off his shoulders with a leathery wing, he nibbled on his lower lip and glanced at the empty cubicle where the receptionist normally resided. Where was she? Normally Paper Cut was there before Shadehooves. Maybe something had come up?\n\nGranted, there was a lot that HAD happened in the last few months, but so far, Shadehooves' little town had avoided the notice of Daybreaker. Maybe, for all she knew, they were just normal ponies churning out odds and ends to keep the populace happy and satisfied. Faust knew that she had been doing all that she could to make it more uncomfortable for everypony, even thestrals.\n\nHe slipped on his safety vest and trotted into the vast floor of the factory. Briefly, he twitched an ear at the sound of a voice, but it was too faint to make out. Sounded like, though, that there was somepony already in his office. He glanced up the stairway that hugged the interior wall of the factory, and then at the small cube that overlooked the floor. Although it looked dark, he could make out a couple of silhouettes there.\n\nInstead of the stairs, he flapped up in a split and landed at the doors of his office. There were definitely a couple of voices inside, one he recognized as Paper Cut's.\n\nHe frowned. Without giving a warning, he unlocked the door and strode in, instantly grabbing the attention of Paper Cut, two soldiers, and another pony who was sitting behind Shadehooves' desk. Shadehooves bristled.\n\nWith an apologetic whimper, Paper Cut stated, "They were rather... forceful."\n\nClapping his hooves together, the stallion behind the desk declared, "It's about time that you got here. I was just about to post guards at the door to keep you out!"\n\n"What?!" Shadehooves demanded, his wings flaring and his blood boiling. Almost immediately, both soldiers trained their guns on him. Paper Cut winced.\n\nThe stallion huffed. Resting back in the chair, he quipped, "Haven't you heard? The Empress sold this to me. Making a few changes." He motioned at Paper Cut, who one soldier moved toward Shadehooves. "Starting," the stallion added, "with a new thestral hiring policy." His eyes glinted. "Or, maybe, FIRING policy.

However, his attention was soon grabbed by the corpse that was underneath where he had been standing. When he stared at the young mare for more than a couple of seconds, he felt something work its way up from his gut and seconds later burning bile evacuated through his mouth.\n\nGagging and sputtering, he collapsed as retches continued to grip him in a vice-like hold. Memories started to flash back over the last half hour. It was chaos.\n\nA mob. Voices from the most ardent among them. What had first been simply an anti-thestral rally within the town after a small altercation between a few thestrals and ponies had escalated. Hard. Was it one of the bats that they had now dealt with that started it? Was it the words of one of the citizens, declaring the thestrals anti-Order?\n\nAnvil's mind felt hazy. It was like swimming through a thick sludge. One moment, he was in the crowd, somewhat agreeing with what they were saying, then he was chanting the same phrase of burning the bats with the rest of them. Gazing again into the glazed eyes of the dead thestral, he swallowed deeply and gasped at the sweltering, dry air.\n\nMob mentality at its finest.\n\nSitting up, he looked at his hoofwork, the only conclusion he could draw, and then caught a couple more ponies march up to a nearby house and ignite it with torches. From inside, there was a loud shriek, and a thestral burst from it, frantically batting at some flames that had covered his body.\n\nAs soon as the rest of the mob saw him, they charged at him, and he went down, quickly surrounded by at least a dozen ponies, all screaming to burn the bats.\n\nAnvil simply gawked at the blaze.

I'm more than qualified for—"\n\nHolding up a wing, the thestral sitting across from Onyx gave a tired sigh. She adjusted the inkwell on her desk and steepled her hooves together. Sunlight peeked through the slightly threadbare curtains that had been hung over the window, providing only a glimpse of the city of Baltimare through it. It was enough that the sapphire blue of the Celestial Sea lit up like a fireball thanks to Daybreaker's sun.\n\nAfter making sure that the inkwell was perfectly straight, the mare across from Onyx stated, "It's not that you aren't qualified, it's just that the others applying are far more." Onyx's ears wilted against her skull. "Do you know how many applicants we have gotten since we posted in the paper?\n\n"I can't even tell you. Probably hundreds.

Although the ocean breeze did alleviate the sauna-like heat, it wasn't much. However, she simply shrugged it off. Wasn't like she wasn't used to it deeper in the jungle.\n\nCatching a few side-eyed glances from average citizens in the city, she slunk along, weaving through the bodies of the pedestrians and keeping her head low. Sure, the "opportunities" that were promised by Daybreaker's announcement that thestrals were being "relocated" to safer and richer areas sounded nice, but with barely a hundred bits left to her name, Onyx could only imagine what she'd have to do to survive. Mangoes were definitely off the table for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs she rounded a corner toward her apartment she shared with a dozen other thestrals, she heard somepony call her out. When she glanced up, she caught that it was a pair of unicorns, dressed in snazzy suits and hats. One wriggled his mustache as the other flagged her down.

Beside them was a sign stating that Flim Flam Arms was hiring for "competitive" wages.\n\nCurious, she flapped over and inquired, "You actually WANT a thestral?"\n\n"My dear mare, Flim Flam Arms is an equal opportunity employer!" one of the unicorns, the mustached one, declared. "Isn't that right, brother?"\n\n"Of course! You know what! We both see you're a talent filly! What say you to starting tomorrow?" the other inquired. Onyx paused for a beat. Then, she chittered and bobbed her head excitedly. The stallion leaned in. "You're not afraid of unstable matrices, are you?""

  solarreworked.45.d:0 "Shifting uneasily in her seat, Moonlight Zephyr tapped her forehooves together and glanced at the clock that hung over the door to the classroom. She worked her tongue around in her mouth and briefly pressed against her fangs. After working her jaw a hoofful of times, she raised a tentative and hesitant forearm, and waited silently to be noticed.\n\nSunlight poured through the large windows in the classroom's exterior wall. Outside, she could see the gentle wave of the fronds of various ferns shivering in a breeze. She exchanged some glances between a couple of her fellow students, but it lasted only for a couple of seconds each.\n\nThere was a cough, a clearing of the throat. "Yes, Moonlight?" her instructor inquired. She had finally looked up from the colt near Moonlight after disciplining him. While the words were nearly emotionless, maybe with just a hint of curiosity, Moonlight's teacher's posture said otherwise. She'd need to word thing carefully.\n\nStuttering a couple of times, Moonlight eventually asked, "Miss Rod, I-If Daybreaker wants the sun to protect everypony all the time, why doesn't she keep it up?" She pointed to the window, as if it was obvious. Since they started class an hour ago, the sun had shifted in the sky, clearly not stuck in one position forever, like Daybreaker had threatened before.\n\nMiss Rod smirked. "Excellent question, Moonlight. What do you think is the answer?"\n\nMoonlight hummed momentarily and scratched her chin. What was the right answer? WAS there a right answer? Drawing upon her memory, she scanned them for any indication about what could be the thing Miss Rod was looking for. Of course, she came up empty.\n\nShe shrugged sheepishly. Internally, she yearned to will the red on her face from appearing, but she couldn't. With a titter, she gave a noncommittal titter, and Miss Rod's grin grew slightly wider.\n\n"Of course, it's not in your nature to know or remember." She frowned. Shaking her head, she stated, "The Empress would have all experience her sun all the time, but she's also wise. She has everypony's best interest—including thestrals like you—at heart. If the sun were in the sky all the time, we'd have no water or weather!"\n\n"What do you mean 'it's not in our, uh, nature?'" a foal behind Moonlight demanded. With an angry chitter, he ruffled his wings and glared at Miss Rod. Miss Rod merely giggled.\n\n"Very well, I think we'll go through this lesson now. Now, who wants to list out the parts of a thestral that are different, and why they've corrupted you?""

  solarreworked.46.d:0 "Panting as sweat poured down her face, Open Palm felt her knees begin to wobble as she performed another charge. Across the simulated battlefield, a number of dummies with crude matrix-powered senors stood behind dummies. Specifically, behind paper targets that could probably only fools would be tricked by, however, there was always a possibility it'd convince others, too.\n\nShe glanced up to the horizon. By now, the sun had been embraced by all that she could, leaving only a sliver of orange peeking out over the edge. Wiping at her forehead with one of her leathery wings, she jumped when she heard somepony exclaim, "And you call that a charge?! Do it again!"\n\nPalm frowned and switched her attention to the voice, and she snarled quietly at the drill sergeant, Outburst. Unlike her, he was completely unruffled, with little indication that he had ever actually spent much time in the trenches with the troops that he was training. Meanwhile, she was practically a walking corpse, given how exhausted she felt. However, as he glared at her, she felt her heart freeze and she choked a couple of times before she nodded and started to trudge toward the other end of the training yard.\n\nAlthough there were a few ponies here and there, it was almost entirely empty, and she caught only one or two of them snatching glances toward her on occasion. By this point, mud had covered much of the yard, which caked her legs.\n\nHer stomach growled, but she suppressed it, as she felt the searing gaze of Outburst following her. When she finally reached the other end of the yard, Outburst bellowed at her, "Charge, lieutenant! Bring that bunker down!"\n\nOnce again, Palm started to gallop toward the false enemy position across from her, but she staggered shortly, as her legs collapsed entirely. She smacked flat onto her face, and she groaned. All her legs felt like they were made of rubber and also on fire, and she could barely make out the sound of hooves clip-clopping toward. Only when she was addressed by Outburst again did she register that she was face-down in the mud.\n\nShe pushed herself up, and Outburst grunted, "Dismissed. You'll continue training tomorrow." There was a glint in his eyes. "I trust you learned what I intended to teach."\n\n"That you have to push through anything to achieve victory?"\n\nFaintly snickering, he shook his head and stated, "No. That you're expendable. MORE expendable. Try to sleep on that one." At that, he turned around and trotted into the barrack. Palm merely flopped back into the mud."

  solarreworked.47.d:0 "It wasn't going to tax itself.\n\nThat was the only thought that Golden Dawn had as he stared at the great, carved edifices of the Moonspeaker temple in Ayacachtli. Rather than the glorious sunlight that the Empress provided, it was only lit by some dim, magically-infused orbs—probably gems of some sort—which cast dark purple beams onto the pillars and massive stone door.\n\nLike much of the city, the street was dark. If not for the spell that some of the Empress's mages had cooked up, he'd barely be able to see in the nocturnal conditions. However, the night vision spell was still working and active, so, for the moment, there was nothing he couldn't make out like a thestral.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\nHe glanced back behind him at a number of thestrals who were watching him with earnest. He played with his holster. If push came to shove, there'd be a couple of dead thestrals, and also himself. He swallowed. Ideally, there'd be no violence. Granted, it was like that last year when he had to be the one to demand tribute from the Moonspeakers, but the thestrals had yet to trust him at all.\n\nProbably never would.\n\nAs an itch started to build under his chin, he scratched at it, sighed, and marched to the doors, which he flung open. Both doors rapidly slowed, but were wide enough for him to enter. Stepping inside, he caught the last few words of something being muttered by a cowled thestral near it. Seconds later, after the thestral finished, Golden rubbed at his chin again.\n\nHe frowned. If the Empress hadn't been lenient, they could have taken all the knowledge of the Moonspeakers and properly sealed it. Instead, they pay her off to continue their anti-Order agenda.\n\nStill, orders were orders.\n\nCordially, the thestral that was near the door offered to take him to the current high priestess, Lazuli. When Golden accepted, he was quickly taken to a deep blue thestral mare in the midst of a dozen other priests. Lazuli glanced up at him and huffed.\n\n"Hello, Golden," she quipped.\n\n"Lazuli," Golden replied as he dug at his chin again. "Surprised that you didn't curse me again, like last year."\n\nShe smirked. "Of course, although you may want to make sure you're not developing a rash." She pointed at his jaw. With an innocent flutter of her eyelashes, she asked, "That time of year again?" She tsked and clapped her hooves again, bringing forth a bag of bits, which she passed over to him.\n\nWith a glitter in her eyes, she stated, "Tell your Empress thanks. Oh, and make sure not to scratch that too much. It will probably make it worse."\n\nHe huffed and grabbed the bag. "Thanks." As he left, he scratched again at his chin, cursing under his breath."

His heart skipped a beat when it didn't need to be unlocked. Somepony had already done the work for him. Blood pounding in his ears, he kicked open the door and demanded as he drew his pistol, "Freeze! I have you—"\n\nHis voice died. All he could manage was a couple of surprised stutters and gasps as he met the gaze of four soldiers and another officer of the newly-minted Militarium. For a second or two, he kept his pistol trained on the first body he had seen as the door opened, then it dropped from his grip. Deafeningly, it clattered to the floor and bounced a foot or two into the office.\n\nIt had already been ransacked. What organization he had had was completely upturned, with the ponies responsible directly in front of him. One pair of troops lowered their own weapons at him, and he held up his hooves in surrender. As he did, the officer there smiled and finished inspecting a couple of trinkets that he had gotten from Hippogriffia during a short vacation there.\n\n"Ah, Captain Javelin," she stated without any hint of surprise or expectation. Merely stating a fact. When she placed the items, a couple of shells, on his desk, she waltzed toward him. He merely gazed at her, his brain misfiring as it ordered him to move away. She bared her teeth. "Such a pleasure that you saved us the trouble of searching for you."\n\n"'Searching for me?'" he echoed as he was at least cognizant enough to understand the connotations. By now, adrenaline had begun to course through his veins, and everything appeared to be moving through a thick soup. His heart slammed against his chest. "You could have—"\n\n"Oh, but this was supposed to be a secret investigation, at least until something came up." She clapped her hooves. As a unit, three of the soldiers seized him before he could jump away. "That something came up, by the way." She snickered. "The Empress was right to order some searches." She was passed a notebook, and she shook her head as she paged through it.\n\n"Expressing admiration of Applejack's honesty? One of the traitors who fled the Empress?" She clicked her tongue. "Shameful, but, truly, no surprise." As she flipped it shut, she declared, "I believe that we have some more questions for you. How's your pain tolerance these days?""

Honor your Empress!"\n\nAt that declaration, Daybreaker sneered as she watched the thirty or so recruits that were in one of the training yards of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s military academy freeze as one, then hurriedly flail themselves into a coherent line. The mare beside her, the drill sergeant, barked at them, "Do you call that a line?! I could send a tank through those gaps! FALL IN!" Again, Daybreaker sniggered as the panicked troopers straightened themselves further.\n\nIt got a noncommittal grunt from the sergeant. After a couple of seconds of scrutinizing them, the sergeant huffed, "They're yours, Empress. Sol Invictus!" She beat her chest in a salute and stepped back.\n\nAt first, Daybreaker didn't move, as she merely at the front of the line, staring every single soldier over. If they ever glanced to her location, she met their gaze immediately, although they'd quickly avert theirs. She licked her lips. A couple began to tremble, if almost imperceptibly, and she waltzed down the line of ponies. After she had passed over all of them once, she nodded, her mane flapping in its nonexistent breeze.\n\nAs a couple of globs of the fiery substance fell off and landed on the ground, leaving behind a sizzling, blackened lump, she proclaimed loudly, "You have been trained well so far. Do you feel ready to serve Harmony?" She grinned when everypony replied at once, at the top of their lungs, that they were.\n\n"Of course," she added with a smug nicker, "are you telling the truth?" As soon as the words left her mouth, she sensed a blanket of fear settle on the training yard. Despite the warmth and brightness of her sun above, a chill gripped the air. She leaned down toward one of the soldiers, a stallion, and gazed directly at him. He whimpered.\n\nSilently, she observed him and stated, "No, you're only scared. But you will die for Harmony."\n\nTrotting toward a pair of troopers, she snapped, "Both of you, tell me, what would you do if you had to fight your own family? Would you lay down everything for Harmony, even them?" When they hesitated, she drew closer. Her mane swirling menacingly, she inquired again, "Would you? Harmony means that much to you, no?"\n\n"W-Well, Empress," one began, her brow breaking out into a sweat. "W-Wouldn't it be better if we—"\n\n"No! No 'buts!'" interjected Daybreaker. "Sympathy for rebels weakens all of Harmony!" Baring her fangs, she snarled, "I think it's time that a little demonstration be given for those who forsake it!""

At the last moment, as he felt his head begin to slump forward, he shook himself awake, and he went back to mindlessly spinning a pen around on his desk. After releasing it and watching it rotate for a good minute before finally coming to a halt, he sighed and went back to stare at the report that was in front of him.\n\nThe buzz of conversation surrounded him, although he couldn't make out heads nor tails of what was being said. Most of it was hushed, as it was through the glass door of his office.\n\nFrowning for a second, he glowered at the frosted surface of the door, barely making out his name in reverse on the entrance. His "new station." Much joy.\n\nReturning to the report, he tapped out the last few words, and then ripped out of his typewriter. At that, he placed it in a stack with all the others, and then pushed them forward. Logistics and conscription numbers. Couldn't they get a pony with more experience in menial labor to handle this? Instead of training the new recruits, he was stuck behind this desk. He could swear he felt pounds being added to waistline while just sitting there!\n\nWith a huff, he glanced over at the map on his office's wall. Sure, there were still the occasional field exercise that he helped organize, with a dozen other officers all chomping at the bit to be Daybreaker's favorite, but that wasn't the same as ordering the recruits around. It wasn't the same as leading an army into a firefight.\n\nWhen he finally broke his fixation on the map, he peered down at his desk. All the niceties that could be afforded his station, of course. He wasn't stupid, though. After it was announced he was going to be "assisting war efforts through analysis," Toffee Roll, his assistant, had claimed that the staff office cheered. He'd be helping them. One of the famed Wonderbolts.\n\nHe scoffed. That love right there was the reason for his placement. After all, he did advocate for taking prisoners and made a comment on record about some of Daybreaker's civil policy he disagreed with. Under his breath, he grunted, "Should have known that'd be the end of me."\n\nMaybe he was too popular to kill, but he was effectively dead in the water, now that every sycophant of Daybreaker watched his moves at the office.\n\nHe checked out the window, then sighed. Opening a drawer, he grabbed a small bottle, and poured a shot.\n\nAt least the day would go by faster."

With a snarl, he glared back at the soldier who had poked him with the end of a rifle and marched forward, defiantly, without having to be escorted further. As soon as he stepped inside, it was like stepping into a sauna that had been left to heat for at least a week. Almost immediately, sweat drenched his forehead and his breaths became a tad more forced.\n\nHowever, Daybreaker appeared unfazed by it, as she stood stoically, staring out one of the windows that looked down into the city. Around the throne room, a number of other guards had been stationed, and they looked to be just about as uncomfortable as him. However, they watched him, and he could see that they all held their guns, ready to pounce at the slightest hint of aggression.\n\nDaybreaker shot him a side-eyed glance. "How good of you to join me, General Sentinel." She returned to staring out the window.\n\nThunderbolt scoffed. Like he had had much choice. Soldiers bursting into his quarters and quasi-arresting him didn't strike him as implying optionality. He bit his tongue.\n\n"I'm certain you can ascertain why you've been summoned," she continued without glancing back at him. For a moment, her mane appeared to grow slightly more chaotic in its whipping around, but it soon settled into a steady pulse of fire.\n\n"Trial?" he inquired. "The troopers who took me seemed convinced that I'd be burnt to a crisp."\n\nAt that, she tittered and ruffled her feathers. "Oh, but of course they would!" She sneered and bared her teeth. From the side profile, he could see how jagged they were, like a predator's. After a couple more snickers, she shook her head. "Thunderbolt Sentinel. General out of necessity during crisis." Clicking her tongue, she added, "Abandoning a front. Abetting rioters. Sympathizing with changelings." She glanced at him. "Need I go on?"\n\n"That they're all lies?"\n\nShe snorted. "Whether they are truths, half-truths, or fabrications matters little. I simply know that you've endangered Harmony and Order." Contorting her expression into a frown, she snarled, "There is only one punishment for traitors like you!" Her horn flared.\n\nAs Sentinel closed his eyes, his mind resigned, he waited. And waited. Finally, Daybreaker quipped, "But that would be simple. Instead, I shall show mercy." Suddenly a warm grip around his throat manifested, and he cracked open his eyes to see Daybreaker inches from his face. "But if you THINK about betraying me again..." She tightened her grip."

She tapped her hooves impatiently on the floor as she craned her neck to glance over the line of about a dozen other ponies in front of her. When she did, another finally got out of the line, and left the quartermaster's station. She internally cheered.\n\nIt wasn't like she could slip out, though, given that there were just as many ponies behind her as in front. She shuffled through the six or seven papers that she had, squinting at a couple to check the legibility of the signatures. Outside, she could hear gunshots as other recruits had already gotten on with their training. But her? No... why would that happen?\n\nShe glanced around. It wasn't like they were absolutely loaded with firearms in the armory, or anything. She could just take one and actually get on with her day on learning how to kill anycreature that opposed the Empress's Harmony and Order.\n\n"Next!" she heard somepony call, and stared blankly when she realized that her spot was already at the front of the line. With a hurried trot, she reached one of the quartermaster's assistants, who appeared ready to collapse into an exhausted heap of flesh.\n\nAs Velocity gazed at the tired stallion's bags under his eyes, he finally yawned a question. "Your name?" She repeated it after a second, her brain catching up from its dulled stupor. He scribbled it down. After suppressing another yawn, he inquired, "You have your training officer's approval?"\n\nShe nodded and passed it. Briefly scrutinizing it, he hummed an affirmation and then asked, "Form twenty-two-A?" She passed it along. "All right," he mumbled and after a few seconds slipped that into a small organizer. "Form thirty-six-C, revision seven?" As she passed him another paper, he hissed and started to pour over it.\n\n"Can't you, I don't know, move faster?" she demanded after a moment. Her heart was beginning to thump against her chest. Unconsciously, she fidgeted from side to side as he continued to mull the form.\n\nFinally turning back to her, he declared as he tapped the form, "You filled in box C: Requesting winter socks instead of box E: Requesting new rifle." He clicked his tongue. "You're going to have to fill it out again." He shrugged and muttered, "Sorry.

After taking a risk to venture a glance over the last lip, he ducked back down when some more gunshots sounded nearby, at least, what he could hear over the buzzing and ringing in his ears, anyway.\n\nGripping the nozzle of his equipment tightly against his chest, he heaved a couple of frantic coughs and whimpers and wiped back a couple of tears. Overhead, he caught the whistle of an artillery shell, and he pressed himself against the rim of the crater when the creaking treads of a tank whipped by only a few feet from him.\n\nBlood raced through his veins, making him feel like his head was about to explode and save the enemy the trouble. All he could smell was soot and smoke, and the acrid sting of it on his throat only added to the tickling sensation that he had in it. Didn't help that his back felt like it was going to be crushed under the weight of the fuel tank he shouldered. How it had managed to survive his scurry through the wasteland, unlike many of his fellows, was beyond him.\n\nAs he held the nozzle tighter again, he forced his breathing to calm, and then he swallowed. Closing his eyes, he yelped and jumped over the lip, making it the last dozen or so feet to the nearby trench, hopped the barbed wire, and landed on all four hooves. He was instantly beset with mud, which soaked his legs.\n\nFrantically whipping the nozzle around, he barely laid eyes on anything, save a couple of severed legs and a partly recognizable body. Blood stained the ground, and his stomach lurched at the sight. He had just been promised that he'd be protecting Harmony, not risking his life diving into an enemy trench!\n\nWhen his heart had slowed, he let out a tired sigh, and then did a quick three-sixty. Nocreature was in sight. Maybe the offensive had already succeeded, and he'd not have to use... his weapon. At the thought, he glanced down at the nozzle and tube again, and swallowed. His back suddenly felt like it was on fire, which, it technically was.\n\nAlthough his knees knocked together, he carefully strode forward, keeping to the inner wall of the trench, and his eyes peeled. Silently, he begged for nocreature to be nearby, but when he rounded a turn, he stared directly at an enemy soldier.\n\nBoth gawked for a second, but he was faster. Whipping up the nozzle, he pulled the trigger, and a spray of orange fire launched at the combatant. As his world filled with blinding light, he smelled the stench of cooked flesh, and he collapsed into a heap, his legs too weak to carry him.\n\nHe wept."

He barely reacted to the sensation of the damp and frigid grime hitting him, as he listened intently to the radio near the back of the emplacement.\n\nAfter a few seconds, he barked an order to the rest of his crew. Coordinates had been given for the location of a particularly thick pocket of enemy troops, and it was within range of the gun. Like lightning, they rushed about their duties, adjusting the angle of the barrel and then loading it with a cartridge. There was a deafening crack, and the artillery jumped backwards from the recoil of the shell.\n\nAlthough he couldn't see the impact of the shot, given the distance, he could imagine it impacting and ballooning into a small jet of debris. He swallowed. Returning to his radio, he scratched down instructions that came through, then froze when the codeword was given. "Unleash Tartarus," the operator had demanded, and he slowly put down his headphones.\n\nGlancing back at the small stack of shells that were near the rear of the foxhole, he carefully twisted to stare at his compatriots, who were readily preparing another, standard round to fire. For a few seconds, he forced back a few gags and chokes, even though there was no dust or smoke in the air. The rumble of the enemy's artillery echoed in the distance, and soon another round of whistling shots sailed all around the battlefield. A few were close enough to see the billowing streams of mud shoot upward.\n\nFinally, he shook himself and snapped, "Halt! S-Special rounds, now!" The rest of the team shot him confused looks, but dutifully removed the shell they'd loaded, and grabbed one from the containers at the back. They had so far been untouched.\n\nAs one was threaded into the breached back of the barrel, Tension put on his headphones again and listened. There was no doubt about it. The order had been given. Empress's command, itself.\n\nA lump built in his throat. Screaming that they fire, he watched as the artillery recoiled back again, and as the shell zipped out of sight. Raising the headphones, he confirmed with the forward base it had been done.

Estimates of when the recent batch of recruits will run dry vary based on numbers from the war, but cause for concern has yet to be seen.\n\nProjections of future casualties maintain various outlooks, depending on how accurate the information is from skirmishes and battles with the enemy is. As of yet, most has been censored to avoid causing undue worry within the populace. Although they have full faith in Harmony, war is still new to them, and outside of those who were trained in previous, minor conflicts like the revolution in Stalliongrad or volunteers who assisted with Cockatrice War, ponies have remained ignorant of what war requires.\n\nTo that end, Militarium recruiters have expressed hesitancy regarding application numbers. While ponies are currently eager to serve, that may dry up as more ponies quote-unquote disappear from civilian life to never return. If a conscription crisis were to happen, it could threaten the stability of [ROOT.GetNameDef] and the safety of Harmony.\n\nRight now, there are multiple ways in which to continue the recruitment high that is seeing our numbers burgeon. Truth about our enemies and how they will rape and pillage anything they can is a consistent motivator, as well as news from the front that speaks of our victories. However, in the case of public opinion swaying against war, it may be prudent to fund presser gangs if need be, or arrest anypony who does not volunteer to serve with the Militarium.\n\nPlease find within this letter visual graphs of current casualty to replacement ratios, and projected losses in one, three, and six month time frames. Conscription is up approximately fifteen percent year over year, and appears to be growing for at least the next quarter.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts, God-Empress.\n\nSol Invictus!\n\nDotted Quill, Minister of War"

After all, she had never had any war experience before. Nopony that she knew had. Yet what choice did she have? Harmony was in danger. Everypony's way of life was at risk. Daybreaker herself couldn't hold off everything, that was old-fashioned. Maybe a hundred years ago, when the changelings weren't organized, or there weren't communists on their doorstep, she could handle war by herself. Now she had to contend with hundreds of thousands of troops. No alicorn could handle that alone.\n\nOf course, being a simple mare meant that she used that straightforward logic. Granted, most of her friends still didn't get it, but they, at this point, had no choice in the matter. Everypony was needed for defending [ROOT.GetNameDef], so the fact that she had signed up on her own instead of being mandated by law, like her friends, was a plus. She got to choose where she worked.\n\nTanks were fun.\n\nTanks were cool.\n\nTanks were her thing.\n\nWith a sigh, she readjusted the toothpick that was in her mouth as her mind drifted back to the present, and she carefully adjusted her seating position as her driver made a hard turn to the right. A dangling piece of eye protection nearly smacked her in the face, and she tiredly reached out a hoof and put it on.\n\n"How much longer?" she asked. Munching on the toothpick, she nodded when she was told it was only another minute until they reached their destination.\n\nFor a second or two, she stared with a lonely gaze at the empty seat to her left. Not having a loader made it both simultaneously more spacious, and significantly more boring. Pretzel Strand was always a good laugh. And he wasn't too bad on the eyes, either.\n\nShaking herself, she peeked out of the tank's turret's flap and watched as she saw a few soldiers run between gaps in the street. By now, they'd entered the small town on the frontline. They had simple orders: support the defense.\n\n"Here," her driver declared, and Candlelight wrapped a hoof around the trigger. After spotting through the turret an enemy combatant, she pulled it. A brilliant stream of orange shot from the tank, and a fireball now sat where the trooper had been.\n\nShe sighed and kicked back as she spotted a couple of more and did the same. After all, she was a simple mare and war was simple. She just had to burn everything that moved."

  solarreworked.80.d:0 "Gritting his teeth, Torchlight strained as he deflected a number of bolts of fire from the mare standing across from him, only a dozen or so feet away in the training room. Although it was bright outside, the room was shrouded in shadow as the curtains had been drawn to hinder their perception, if only slightly. Given that it was currently alight with various oranges and reds from the flames that soared through the air, it wasn't like there was much of an effect.\n\nWith each blast, he was knocked further back, toward the edge of the ring they were in, and he caught her smirking. He sighed. Hair Trigger was always confident, even when it bit her in the flank. Such as now.\n\nAs he absorbed and reflected a couple more shots, he finally snatched one of the fireballs with his own magic and hurled it back toward her. Before she could fully react, the glob of red exploded at her hooves, and she staggered back from the force of it. With his student dazed, Torchlight followed up with a pair of light bursts, which also detonated nearby, and caused her to stumble out of the ring. At that, he exclaimed, "Enough! Stand down!"\n\nShe slowly regained her footing, then huffed and walked back into the ring, to meet up with him. He clicked his tongue. As he reopened the curtains, he stated, "Better, but did not anticipate me taking advantage of a respite." He huffed. "Shall we go again? You are becoming talented with fire."\n\nShe smirked. "Sure, why not?" With a barely cocky chuckle, she added, "If you can handle the heat, that is."\n\nRolling his eyes, he mentally noted that she'd have to have another round of training regarding respect for superiors. However, he put that away for the moment and soon the second round commenced. Like the first, he was soon pelted by blasts of fire, however, there was no break from them. Despite how he could make out sweat pouring down her face from the exertion, she didn't relent.\n\nEven he was beginning to perspire, and his horn sputtered in protest for holding the defensive spells for so long. Before he had much more time to think, his eyes widened when a large balloon of fire built over her head, which she prepared to hurdle. He acted quickly. Snapping at her to stop, he jumped to the side out of instinct. Seconds later, said ball of fire smashed into the ring, and tongues of flame licked out in a large crater.\n\nExchanging glances with her as the fire-resistant surface burned, he sighed. She was eager to bring suffering to the Empress's enemies, that was for sure."
  solarreworked.80.a:0 "Perhaps a bit too eager."
  solarreworked.81.t:0 "Minor Complications"
  solarreworked.81.d:0 "Tapping a hoof on her desk in thought, Evening Pyre hummed to herself as she brought the microphone closer to her in her magic. Her lab was quiet, since her colleagues had left rather quickly once the end of the day approached. But her? No, she had to stay and catalogue what she saw, after all. It had been a productive day.\n\nAfter taking in the sight before her again, she shrugged and pressed the button of the recorder that rested next to her. "Subject experienced rapid, spontaneous hemorrhaging after being exposed to the magic from crystal batch seven-six dash e-two-three. Death was instantaneous. Estimate that at least sixty percent of blood was lost in two tenths of a second."\n\nFurrowing her brow, she rubbed at the back of her neck as she squinted and stared at the carnage. Briefly pondering her words, she glanced to the three or four crystals that were sitting on a shelf nearby. All were sealed behind glass in their containers. About half glittered in the light from the one lamp that she had on. For a second, she watched the swirling energies inside. They seemed so harmless, yet given how much they could discharge in a single use, that was far from the case.\n\nSure, they could also figure out stability and durability, but what fun was that when raw firepower could solve everything?\n\nBringing the microphone back up, she snorted and added, "Subject also appears to possibly have had an allergic reaction to the magic discharge, outside of intended effects. Current hypothesis is that magic contained within crystals may undergo slight alterations that cause ponies' nervous and thaumaturgic systems to go haywire." She hummed. "Additionally, subject successfully was burned, although distance was not ideal."\n\nShe sighed. There wasn't as much as she could fill in as she hoped. Dissecting the test subject would take a while, and with only her in the lab, it'd take even longer. Probably would have to be tomorrow, if she could pin a couple of down.\n\nWith that resolution in mind, she raised the mic one last time and added, "Also, will have to research how to prevent explosive decompression of magical power when trigger is pulled." She huffed and shot one more look at the display of magic power before her. "It's really a shame when the test subject and the operator are lost." Frowning, she stared at her recording's muse. Her assistant lay on the floor, burnt to a crisp, and with a massive pool of blood around her. Pyre simply shrugged, checked the subject used for the test, and concluded, "Consider hiring another assistant. Emphasize there's hazard pay.""
  solarreworked.81.a:0 "We'll have to figure out this explosive aspect later."
  solarreworked.83.t:0 "Rebranded"
  solarreworked.83.d:0 ""My, my, trying to run, were we?" Daybreaker crooned as a pair of soldiers forced Spitfire down to her knees. Not too far in the distance, flames could be seen licking into the sky from what used to be the main building of the Wonderbolt Academy. Soot slowly descended upon the training grounds, where more ponies were being lined up by her soldiers. Spitfire strained against her captors.\n\nWhen she couldn't break free, Spitfire merely sat, indignantly, and glared at Daybreaker. Daybreaker merely clicked her tongue. The rush of adrenaline still coursed through her veins. Concentrating on the academy was simple. Calling the fire from the heavens, also basic. Just a bit of molecular excitement to create a "spontaneous" combustion. Still, getting out and into the fray, against such a prominent defier of her, it made her shiver excitedly.\n\n"Look, Daybaker, or whatever you're called, if you're done congratulating yourself about being evil, well, can we hurry this along?" Daybreaker jerked her head toward Spitfire, who held a bored expression on her muzzle. For her impropriety, she was cracked on the back of the head with a butt of a rifle.\n\nShe laughed. "Oh, mare, that's gonna leave a mark." She smirked. "But, nothing I can't handle."\n\n"Awfully nonchalant, no?" inquired Daybreaker as she sauntered toward Spitfire. She bared her fangs. "No pleading for mercy? No begging to know what could possibly have incurred this punishment?"\n\n"Meh." Spitfire did what she could to shrug. "Congrats. You burned down a building."\n\nSnarling, Daybreaker stomped up to Spitfire and peered directly into her soul. Her mane flashed and sparked, and she growled, "This is no game, traitorous scum!" She huffed. "You have twisted the minds of your recruits against Harmony! Against me!" When Spitfire remained placidly uncaring, Daybreaker flared her nostrils, snorted, and whinnied before standing up straight.\n\nShe glanced at her guards. They thankfully remained stoic. Such outbursts were not proper, if they did not inspire fear. Which this apparently did not. However, there were other ways to break a pony. She chortled. "You're probably expecting death. It's only proper, after all."\n\nAt Spitfire's repeated shrug, she hissed, "Oh, I'm afraid that death is too good for you, and your ilk." She gestured to the burning academy, to the students being led away by gunpoint. "Soon, a new name will replace you and your beloved Wonderbolts. And you—" She faced Spitfire. "You'll... have other duties." She grinned. "I believe there are test pilots needed. You'll fit the bill."\n\nSpitfire gave a small start, but didn't protest. Daybreaker could see her jaw tighten, however. Tittering, she gave Spitfire a mocking salute, and waltzed away."
  solarreworked.83.a:0 "I believe the Solarbeams would be an appropriate replacement."
  solarreworked.84.t:0 "Screams on the Wind"
  solarreworked.84.d:0 "Sighing as a couple beams of warm sunlight sent a small shiver down her spine, Morning Grace cracked her neck and rubbed at her eyes as she rolled out of bed and slowly trudged toward the nearest mirror. After taking a second to observe her appearance, she quickly cleaned herself and prepared her morning meal of a few daisies and a single apple. Aside from the faint munching of her food, there was barely a sound in town.\n\nOutside her window, she saw a few denizens of the sleepy hamlet of Stampede Crossing waltz by. Whenever they noticed each other, they'd stop to wave at least, if not chat for a few minutes. She nickered and finished her apple, spitting out the core and scoring a perfect lob shot to the waste basket.\n\nAfter flipping through the pages of the thin newspaper, which mostly just had informational pieces of what the Empress had been working on as of late, she folded it and got up. Given how distant and unimportant the hamlet was from any potential conflicts, there was little to go about in the settlement. Not that she minded.\n\nShe flicked an ear as she picked up the faint buzz of something outside. Popping her head out of the rickety door of her house, she saw others do the same as well as the ponies in the street look up. Although she wasn't a fighter, it didn't take much to recognize the drone of a plane's propellor. She frowned.\n\nIt wasn't like she had never seen one before, same with many of the other inhabitants. Still, what was doing all the way out here? It wasn't like they were in any strategic locations.\n\nFurrowing her brow as she heard the noise grow closer, she finally spotted a pair of fighter planes, decorated with [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] insignias. Momentarily, the elation of seeing a couple of the Empress's pilots caused her heart to jump, but that joy turned sour as the planes started to descend from their current altitude.\n\nIt was subtle at first, but along with the thrum of the propellors, a whining sound began to build, drilling practically into the back of her brain as it grew. Said noise reached a crescendo as the planes suddenly dipped further. Around her, ponies scattered, and her heart thrashed against her chest, but her limbs locked up. At the last second, as the two planes zoomed overhead, the continued wail stretching and deepening as they passed by.\n\nAs soon as it was there, it was gone, and the planes were off, but she spotted flyers descending slowly on the wind. With her wits gathered, she grabbed one and huffed. It warned of a new airplane test. She frowned and glared after the specks that were the planes."

  solarreworked.85.t:0 "Compliant Service"
  solarreworked.85.d:0 ""You know, I feel that I'm not very appreciated for everything I've done to help you guys," Spitfire cracked as she glanced out the tight cockpit of her plane. Both her hooves were locked to the rudder, held by faint bands of magic. "Or, if you're going to be fancy, maybe an in-flight movie or—"\n\n"Test will commence in ten seconds. Any further chatter will result in immediate termination." Flinching, Spitfire flapped her ears a couple of times as the uncaring voice filled the cockpit. She huffed. "Fine, fine, I can take a hint. I'm not loved. Kill me. Do your worst, or—"\n\n"Diving."\n\nSuddenly, her stomach lurched up into her throat as the remote controls of the plane chassis pitched her nose almost directly toward the ground. Within seconds, as the plane's speed soared and g forces slammed her into her seat, she heard the whine of wind zipping past the plane body, as well as a building shriek of one of their projects.\n\nWhile her mind flashed to an accidental dive with one of her first practice flights with a Hurricane, she blinked away spots that were forming in her vision, but they continued to spread. Something was said on the radio, but she could barely process it, let alone respond. Despite being bound to the rudder, her hooves were unable to allow her a grip or the strength to pull it back. The pressure built on her body, but the baggy suit she wore managed to keep the worst of it off.\n\nShe blinked a couple more times, then screamed when she felt water on her face. Now wide awake, she glanced around to see herself back on the ground, and staring up at the sky. Shortly, her arms suddenly felt on fire, and she groaned as she tried to move them. More aches and pains shot through her with each attempt, and she caught somepony whom she saw dressed in a lab coat state, "Excellent read-outs from the suit. Need to test again, though. A higher dive, perhaps?"\n\nWith effort, she finally hauled herself into a sitting position and spotted her plane. Aside from a few scratches on the paint, it appeared fine. It must have pulled out of the dive by itself. Maybe another remote control aspect?\n\n"Her body is not going to hold up much more with this. Maybe if we—"\n\nThe same cold voice cut through the chattering scientist with a growl. "She goes back up. Now. She made her choices, and now it's time to teach some consequences."\n\nAt that, she was roughly snatched by a couple of guards and dragged back to the plane. As she lazily tossed in, she sighed and quipped, "Better luck next time, sunkissers!""

Your neighbors' foals are playing in the street and their giggles put a smile on your face.\n\nBut what's that?

  solarreworked.92.d:0 "Before the Empress's ascension, the navy was the envy of all those on Equus, rivaled only by the Griffonian Empire and Hippogriffia. Although it was rarely utilized, and served mostly as a deterrent, it still saw some action in the lead-up to the turn of the millennium, and in recent years, has skewed heavily in favor of carriers and naval-focused planes. The admiralty itself has remained outwardly loyal, although there has been some indication that a few have abandoned the Empress.\n\nThese supposed loyalists are in all levels of the admiralty, and have routinely suppressed some ponies within the ranks from achieving higher positions. Whether it was because of claimed disregard for safety or overly aggressive actions endangering crew and pursued enemies alike, among many other other reasons, the ponies who could serve the Empress best have been prevented from doing so.\n\nHowever, the Empress has tasked the navy as a whole with a thorough investigation of potential anti-Order supporters, and this has already led to a number of arrests. With these gaps in the structure of the admiralty, there is finally opportunity for ponies who have served eagerly since before the Empress's ascension to be appointed to the positions they deserve.\n\nThere is no shortage of captains and officers from which new, high-ranking officials could be appointed, and many of them have ideas on how the Imperial Navy could be improved. While the current number pulled may be small, it is just an indication of those whom we could impress upon in the future.\n\nRemoving the barriers for these officers will lead to further innovations and advancements in the navy. Without some of the qualms of the old guard, they will guide our ships into a new age of bravery and pride against our enemies."

  solarreworked.93.d:0 "Taking a deep breath, Sea Spray gazed out from the bridge of his flagship, Daybreaker's Sword, onto the glassy sea of the South-Eastern Fire Sea. Nary a cloud in the sky broke the sun's reflection upon the water, which pierced his vision and forced him to squint  to stave off being blinded. Readjusting his cap, he stepped back and checked some of the crew at their stations. The radio operator was busy chatting with the fleet's second lead ship.\n\nFrom the nods that he saw the mare giving, there was obviously an exchange of coordinates or information going on. Giving a small frown, he furrowed his brow and traipsed to the operator, who jumped slightly in surprise as he almost silently pulled up behind her, but she saluted and stated, "'Sun's Lance' reports that one of her scout planes spotted a makeshift port about five clicks north-east."\n\nSea Spray pondered. It took a moment for the map of the region to visualize in his mind, but he eventually bobbed his head and stated, "Most likely our target." He shrugged. "Or part of it."\n\n"Should the rest of the fleet focus on—" she began before he cut her off with a shake of his head.\n\nAs a glint filled his eyes, he declared with a sneer, "Why? We have this ship? It's close." At that, he spun around and reached for the ship's internal intercom. After a small break of static, he ordered everypony to battle stations, and barked orders to the bridge. He scratched his chin. There had been no action on the seas for months, ever since the flagship had arrived to the rest of the pirate-hunting fleet. Maybe the pirates had heard about the ship?\n\nLooking out onto the deck of 'Daybreaker's Sword', he smiled. Every turret he could make out was rotating toward the directions that was provided for the makeshift port. For a couple of seconds, they stopped, and then he heard the gunnery officer order them to fire. In unison, the guns he could see belched great, orange clouds of smoke. The ship rocked to the side, as the excess recoil pushed it back.\n\nIn the distance, he watched as there were a series of explosions on the small island indicated to have an illegal port. Smiling, he glanced back. "Want to bet how many volleys this will need?" He snorted. "Never bring a destroyer to a battleship's job," he muttered as he he sat down and listened to the guns fire another round."

  solarreworked.94.d:0 "Nervously lighting a cigarette and taking a couple of puffs, Rough Sketch coughed as the burning sensation of the smoke filled her lungs. However, she felt a small, almost infinitesimal lightening of her stress. It was like somepony had taken off a single strand of hay from a haystack off. Was it really all that better? She couldn't say. At least, it stopped her from anxiously tapping a hind hoof on the ground.\n\nPouring over the blueprints in front of her, she closed her eyes and counted to five. While it took a second or two, she was able to visualize the designs without error. Given that she had studied them after penning each for a solid four or five hours, it they'd better have been ingrained by now! If she was going to "convince" the Empress, she needed to be able to answer any question leveled at her.\n\nShe glanced at the clock above her office's entrance. After a moment, she got up and paced, only momentarily watching the ant-like movement of the ponies and cars going by on the streets in Manehattan. In the distance, a couple of warships slowly drifted along the water, making their way toward the region's naval headquarters. She peeked back at her blueprints.\n\nEverything was perfect. She was sure of it.\n\nIf it wasn't...\n\nShe shuddered. Switching her gaze to a paper that was partly hidden under the schematics, she winced. "Anti-Order activity," as the letter had claimed. All because of, what, she may have tried grabbing some banned books to study for ancient shipbuilding techniques that could be adapted to modern hulls?\n\nShe took another inhale of her cigarette, blowing out a cloud of soot. She gagged again. Despite it being her vice, getting used to the sensation was something that her body would probably never do. She paused for a second to stare at the smoldering butt. As she did, there was a knock on her door and the secretary of her design company meekly stated, "She's here, Rough."\n\nRough's blood froze. Realizing she was pale, she took a couple of quick puffs and then barked, "Let her in already!"\n\nAs the secretary ducked out, Daybreaker soon followed, followed by a pair of guards. After bowing, Rough stammered, "I-I promise that you'll find this to your liking, Empress. Y-You didn't—"\n\n"I only came because it was amusing," Daybreaker interjected with a snort. "Bribing me to end your investigation, no doubt."\n\nFlinching, Rough ignored the jab and went over the plans with Daybreaker, especially emphasizing the firepower of the proposed personal flagships for the Empress, and she gulped when Daybreaker stayed silent. Finally, Daybreaker stated, "It looks promising." She hummed in thought."

  solarreworked.50.t:0 "A Sister's Love"
  solarreworked.50.d:0 ""Celestia! I came as fast as I could!" Luna exclaimed as she burst through the door of Celestia's makeshift office, which her sister had commandeered once the war began. As soon as she entered, her breath caught in her throat when she caught the various stacks of papers, reports, and charts that were scattered around the floor. A pair towered almost as high as the ceiling, which made her crane her neck upward to try and see the top of them.\n\n"Celestia?" she inquired. Somewhere buried in the piles of paper, her sister sneezed and a small cloud of paper flew toward the door from the desk in the middle of the room.\n\nWhen Celestia didn't bid her come, Luna rolled her eyes and trotted toward the desk and floated off the pages, which all appeared to be costs and recent casualty reports. "Sister, you must—" Her train of thought halted when she she saw Celestia. The alicorn's eyes were bloodshot, and her fur was tracked with mascara. Even her normally regal mane was completely frazzled and fraying. About a dozen cups of coffee were scattered across the desktop, along with some stains from spilled refills.\n\nLuna smirked.\n\nFinally peering up at her sister, Celestia whimpered, "Don't look at me."\n\n"Then, pray tell, why did you summon me?" calmly prodded Luna as she made her way around the desk.\n\n"I don't know!" Celestia retorted. Crossing her forelegs together, she shifted to avoid looking at Luna. She flinched when Luna rested a forehoof on her shoulder. Neither said anything, and Luna could feel the tension escalating in the room.\n\n"Is something wrong?" Luna gently nudged at last. Celestia shot a glance back at Luna as tears trickled down her cheeks. Luna hissed, while Celestia simply went back to gazing at her hooves.\n\nSwallowing deeply, Luna prodded, "'Tia... you have taken on so much. Mayhap you should—"\n\n"No!" bellowed Celestia, which made Luna's ears flatten in surprise. Celestia blushed. "I-I mean, I can't. They're my ponies, and I have to protect them, and I can't do that if—" Before she could finish, Luna leaned in and pulled Celestia out of the chair and onto the floor.\n\nLuna simply clicked her tongue as she wrapped her wings around Celestia. "You love them, 'Tia, which is why you fret." As tears started streaking down her own muzzle, Luna pulled up Celestia's chin with a wingtip, and she choked out, "But you can't do it on your own. Let me help. Please."\n\nAs she returned to an embrace, she heard Celestia sniffle, "Okay.""
  solarreworked.50.a:0 "Good talk."
  solarreworked.51.t:0 "A Sister's Fear"
  solarreworked.51.d:0 ""I—I just don't know, Lulu," Celestia sighed tiredly. Outside, she could hear the steady beat of hooves as ponies marched through the command post. It was not far from the front lines, but that was how Luna preferred it. If she wasn't leading her troops directly, she wasn't truly a leader. Celestia simply massaged one of her temples. Black circles ringed her eyes, and her body ached.\n\n"That... is certainly an ordeal, 'Tia," Luna breathed, her eyes tracking Celestia as the princess anxiously got to her hooves and began to pace in the tent. "When was the last time you properly slumbered?"\n\n"I slept last night."\n\n"Was it for more than an hour? I was able to attend to my dream duties last night, and I did not sense your presence in the dream realm." Luna arched a brow inquisitively as Celestia fidgeted. "Perhaps you have spent too much time—"\n\nAbruptly interrupting Luna's statement, a blaring alarm siren pierced the air, which whipped the alicorns' heads outward. Almost immediately afterward, a series of gunshots resounded and Luna sprang up from her desk. Various pictures of her with soldiers or half-finished dream catchers were knocked loose by her sudden movement. "An assault?!" she demanded aloud. "Who would be foalish enough to—"\n\nHer answer was a bullet that whizzed through the tarp, which narrowly avoided grazing Celestia's cheek. The two of them stared at each other for a beat, then Luna's horn ignited in a blue flare, before she charged out of the tent.\n\nPanting heavily, Celestia galloped out after Luna with wobbly legs. She whined when she saw a number of ponies fighting each other, although some of the ones that lost reverted in bright green flashes to their changeling form.\n\nIn the chaos of gunshots and screams, she lost track of Luna. When there was a loud explosion of magic, she quickly darted to Luna's location. She arrived to see Luna standing over three corpses, breathing heavily. However, she was oblivious to a fourth pony who was creeping up on her, knife between his teeth.\n\n"Luna!" she shrieked, just as the disguised changeling pounced. As he landed on Luna, about ready to stab, Celestia roared in fury, and a sudden ball of fire wrapped around the changeling. He batted at himself for a second before scrambling off Luna, and collapsing in a stinking pile of burnt chitin.\n\nWhen her vision cleared, she saw her work, and collapsed, her stomach giving out. She joined the changeling on the ground, the taste of bile in her mouth."
  solarreworked.51.a:0 "What have I done?!"
  solarreworked.52.t:0 "Command Confusion"
  solarreworked.52.d:0 "Barely containing the fire that was raging in her chest, Princess Luna marched through the hallways of Canterlot Castle. Her peripheral vision was tinged red, and she softly ground her teeth against each other. Every guard that was stationed along her path toward Celestia's chambers dove out of her way. None had to be mind-readers to see the veritable cloud of emotion that was visible on her face.\n\nWhen she arrived at her sister's door, she inhaled deeply and mimicked the technique that Cadance had showed her. Apparently it greatly assisted Twilight whenever she was in a tizzy. After repeating it a few times, she came to one conclusion: it was bunk. If anything, she wanted to plant the hoof she had used through Celestia's wall, and then—\n\nShe cut herself off before it turned into an internal rant. Instead, she rapped heavily on Celestia's door before she barged in. Celestia, her mane rather frizzy and unkempt, jerked up her head at Luna's entrance. She gawked silently.\n\nIn an overly sweet and caring voice, Luna smiled in a saccharine manner and inquired, "Sister, please, perchance, if you could inform Us what possible reason that THOU WOULDST AGREE TO THIS INSANITY?!" Her outburst managed to crack some of the marble around the door's entrance and under her hooves. Furiously, she held out a series of papers, authorizing, with Celestia's seal, a thinly-veiled all out assault on [BUF.GetNameDef].\n\nCelestia simply stared at it for a second, then hastily poured herself a goblet of wine and guzzled it down. She didn't reply. Rather, she started to pour over reports on her desk.\n\n"Dost thou need another reprimand?!" Luna demanded, stomping over to Celestia's desk and slamming the papers approving the "special military operation". "Verily, We didst not conceive that thou wouldst agree to thy warmonger advisors' counsel." Shooting Celestia a glare, she demanded, "Pray tell, what hast thou for thy defense?!"\n\n"Dialect, Lulu," Celestia finally grunted, although she avoided looking at her sister.\n\n"Nay, We shall speak to thee as We wish! What hast possessed thee?! Our sister would never—"\n\n"I don't know!" Celestia barked, making Luna flinch and back. "I-I just felt like... somepony else was controlling me. I—" She gulped back tears. "I don't know..."\n\nSighing, Luna brushed back her mane and stated, "We—I suppose there is one solution. It may save us some embarrassment." Quirking a brow, she inquired, "Do you not agree?""

  solarreworked.53.d:0 ""Oh PLEASE, Princess, just because YOU happen to run ONE school that has not completely collapsed without the EEA's direction doesn't mean that you can suddenly dictate national policy!" Chancellor Neighsay spat, his voice echoing through the throne room of Canterlot Castle. Aside from himself and Twilight Sparkle, it was empty. Day Court had been suspended for some time, what with the war going on. From her vantage point on her throne, Celestia stared tiredly at the two of them.\n\nHer head was pounding. Racing around in her skull were thoughts of returning to more important matters, such as writing condolences for families, communicating with sympathetic countries, and directing the war effort. Yet, she would always make time for Twilight, who had requested this audience.\n\nOf course, that decision could have been a mistake.\n\nAt Neighsay's thinly veiled insinuation at her competency, Twilight snorted and ruffled her wings. "Chancellor, as much as I still respect the EEA, I am also required, as the Princess of Friendship, to point out extreme violations of basic ideals of [EQS.GetAdjective] society!" With a small cough, she materialized a large stack of papers, and started flipping through them. "For example, on page seventy-two of the current EEA guidelines, revision seven, on paragraph six, section C—"\n\n"YES, Princess, we both understand that you have read the guidelines." Neighsay gritted his teeth. Barely withholding a smile, Celestia swore that she saw a couple of grey hairs sprout on his head. "Now, do you have a point, about the rules regarding species specific entrances?"\n\n"They're completely degrading!" Twilight barked, throwing the papers away and pointing accusingly at him. "Imagine if I went to [YAL.GetNameDef] and they made me go through—"\n\n"They are safety features!" interjected Neighsay. Marching a couple of steps closer, he growled and his turquoise eyes flashed with fury. "Imagine if a yak or an adult dragon—"\n\n"Safety for whom?!"\n\n"For themselves. For other ponies!" Neighsay rolled his eyes. "Please, Princess, you must understand that they are far larger than us, and—"\n\n"Make all entrances bigger! It's not hard to make everycreature feel welcome and—"\n\n"Maybe we should just calm down?" Celestia stated meekly as she massaged her temples with her front hooves. However, both educators completely ignored her, further delving into the pros and cons of architectural decisions into account for schools.\n\nShe sighed. She should have grabbed a wine bottle, first."

  solarreworked.54.d:0 ""And we currently have—" Raven Inkwell flipped through a few pages rapidly on her clipboard, the pages ruffling and crackling. Outside, the din of a thousand conversations of ponies walking about the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] carried in through the open windows and balcony of Celestia's private quarters. "The visit to the Acornage Memorial in fifteen minutes. You're scheduled to speak there for thirty, but if you can cut it down to twenty, we'll have plenty of time to—"\n\nCutting herself off, Raven wiped at her brow, given the rather warm weather conditions of mid-summer, and she sighed as she looked at Celestia. Celestia was restlessly wriggling one of her hindlegs and otherwise listening to the talk down below the castle. Her face was lined with stress, and she hadn't even touched her tea. Or, more impressively, her cake.\n\n"Princess?" inquired Raven as she sipped on her own glass. When Celestia didn't respond, Raven snorted. "Princess!" she repeated, her outburst managing to make Celestia jump in surprise. Raven arched a brow. "I said we have to leave for your speech, and then if we—"\n\n"I-I heard you, Raven," Celestia interjected, her voice low and huffy. Raven merely rolled her eyes. Eyeing her cake, Celestia poked at it and queried, "And what is after presenting a charity check to Countess Coloratura for the displaced fillies orphanage?" Raven could see that she bit her tongue and tensed her jaw. Although Celestia may have been able to hide things from nobles who saw her infrequently, there wasn't a detail that her secretary could miss. Especially when it meant more paperwork.\n\n"What is it?" she asked. She stowed the pencil she had into the nook of her clipboard.\n\nAs Raven adjusted her glasses, Celestia mulled a response. Poking her tongue against her cheek, she finally stuttered, "I-I am merely seeing all those—" She shuddered "—All the ponies I'll have to apologize to. That funeral—"\n\n"It was one soldier. You—"\n\n"No! It was a PONY! One of MY ponies!" Jumping to her hooves, Celestia paced to and fro, and Raven started to automatically stroke off planned events with a sigh. Celestia snarled, "She should have never been on the front lines! My ponies are not safe when—"\n\n"Princess, if I may, I've taken the liberty to cancel all your appearances today, and I will order a second cake from Sugar Cube Corner." Getting up, Raven added as she reached the door. "I'll make a statement that you are indisposed because of an emergency war council session."\n\nTaking a deep breath, Celestia relaxed slightly and muttered, "Thank you, Raven.""

  solarreworked.55.d:0 "With a sigh, Princess Luna rubbed her forehead as some of the words on the page in front of her blurred together. Glancing up at the clock, she groaned and increased the pressure of her hooves against her temples. She had been at the exact words of the speech for the last several hours. Although her dream duties had been dealt with, she still should have at least had a nap before now. The sun was far beyond the horizon, and her nocturnal circadian rhythm still loved to rear its head on her.\n\nAfter blinking away a bit of her drowsiness, she read through what she had penned with sweeping calligraphy. She nodded.\n\nAs she rested the sheet down, the door to her chambers banged open, and she jerked her attention toward the noise. Her wings flared defensively, but she smiled when she exclaimed, "Oh, 'Tia. Perchance your next entrance shall be announced?" She frowned when she took in Celestia's scowl. Dark circles lined her sister's eyes, and she was furtively investigating the room.\n\n"'Tia?" Luna inquired. Although she kept her expression neutral, her blood started to run cold.\n\n"What did you believe you'd accomplish, Lulu?" Celestia finally asked. She was faint, and Luna strained to pick up the question. Smiling, Celestia stalked toward Luna, and Luna began to spread her wings warily, in case she needed to bolt backward.\n\n"We—I beg your pardon, 'Tia, but I am confused as to what you are—"\n\n"DON'T PLAY IGNORANT WITH ME!" A couple of veins bulging in Celestia's neck, she jammed a hoof toward Luna. Her mane whipped dramatically. Barring her teeth, Celestia growled, "You USURPED me! You locked ME out of my—"\n\n"What?! Your tantrum was spurred by MY act of kindness?!" Luna shot back. Instantly springing to her hooves, she returned Celestia's glare with one of her own. She jutted her jaw forward. "YOU have been bearing the weight of leadership alone! Are we not sisters? Did we not promise that we would rely upon each other?" At that, Celestia's glower faltered. Luna softened her frown. "I only desired to help you. Your weekly war address to the nation was taking a toll. I wished to shoulder it for a time."\n\nAlthough Celestia remained rigid, her lip was quivering and her eyes shimmered with unshed tears. Luna carefully trotted forward. When Celestia didn't move, Luna closed the distance and wrapped Celestia in a gentle embrace of her wings. She whispered, "Please accept my aid.""

  solarreworked.56.d:0 ""If we dig great trenches along the river line, Princess, we may yet hope to hold—" Rockhoof began before he cut himself off at the glare that Princess Celestia leveled at him. Around the room of various heads of the Equestrian military, exchanged glances and furtive looks belied an underlying tension that any there could taste, but darned not cut.\n\n"So we simply cower and hope that we are spared?" Celestia inquired, her voice low and threatening. When the entire high command assembled remained quiet, Celestia expanded her furious stare to the others. "WELL?!" she demanded. For a brief second, her mane flashed a bright orange.\n\n"Princess, if I may," Flash Magnus began with meek clearing of his throat. Despite Celestia not moving, it was as if the sun itself were focused on him. While he stood at attention, a couple of dribbles of sweat ran down his neck. "You have been at EVERY meeting of the high command since its inception." He motioned to the others. "None of us have had perfect attendance." He shuffled on his hooves. "I know I've not been given permission to speak freely, but perhaps you should remove yourself from these for a few weeks?" Slowly, he got some other nods.\n\n"I—" Celestia started with a nervous, quiet hitch. "I suppose I—" She clamped her mouth shut. For a second, one of her ears twitched and she gazed practically into Flash's soul. When she spoke again, her voice hard hardened. "I suppose I am to remain ignorant? You wish to hide the truth from me, don't you?"\n\nWaving his forehooves frantically, Flash shook his head and was followed by Rockhoof, Copper Top, and Spitfire. "No! Absolutely not! But we all see how these are taking a toll on you. I'm suggesting that you... merely take a break." He flashed her an uncomfortable smile.\n\n"Yer head ain't screwed on just right, now," Granny Smith interjected, which earned a glower from Celestia. At that, Granny simply smiled.\n\nCasting her attention around the room, Celestia's mane flared bright again, and she growled. "I see," she finally stated calmly. However, before the collective sigh could be uttered, she barked, "You wish to HIDE the true cost of this war, don't you?! You believe me incapable of handling it? You believe me incompetent!" Her mane whipped rapidly, and one of her ears twitched repeatedly.\n\n"With all due respect, Princess," Spitfire bellowed back, "but you need to get with the program!" She gestured to everypony there. "You think we're going to lie to you?! What the buck's gotten into you?!" At that, Celestia swallowed hard, and met their gazes."

  solarreworked.57.d:0 "Flipping through some of the papers on her clipboard, Raven Inkwell tiredly trudged through the hallways of Canterlot Castle. The atmosphere of the corridors was heavy, to say the least. Although the servants continued their duties, they did so with uneasy, stilted movements. Occasional glances to the side or avoided eyes were enough for her to read that they understood that things were far from well.\n\nAdmittedly, she knew it, too. Since the war began, Princess Celestia had taken on far more than she needed. She knew it. The other princesses knew it. The entire castle knew it. However, that did not stop Celestia from doing so. What was originally a point of pride on how much their leader cared for them slowly turned into shared worry. But, was there much that could be done when Celestia made up her mind?\n\nPondering the question, she shortly arrived at Celestia's quarters. The sun had risen only recently, and it cast long, towering shadows across the hall. On either side of her door, a guard stood at attention, but they both nodded at Raven. It wasn't like she was unknown. She swiftly showed them the itinerary, and then they allowed her entrance.\n\nAs she stepped inside and the doors closed after she was announced, Raven shifted on her hooves. Celestia had not greeted her. In fact, all she was doing was standing in front of a mirror. She was eyeing her reflection.\n\n"No, that's not possible," Celestia randomly interjected, then paused, as if she was listening to somepony else. However, the only ponies in the room were herself, Raven, and, if a reflection counted, her reflection. She still was completely oblivious to Raven's entrance.\n\nStomping a hoof, Celestia added, "No! She wouldn't dare! She's loyal, trustworthy, and a friend to Harmony!"\n\nRaven cleared her throat. At that, Celestia jumped, and for the briefest second, there was a shimmer of yellow in her eyes. Raven blinked in shock and it was gone. Probably just reflection of the sunlight. Celestia stared at her. Finally, Celestia stated, "R-Raven, you did not announce yourself."\n\n"I was announced, Princess," Raven replied flatly, and she gave a small bow of her head. "Forgive me for eavesdropping."\n\nBlushing at the mention, Celestia stammered, "I-I simply have to... talk out what I am to say sometimes. You understand. These stressful times." One of her eyelids twitched. "I must be SURE that Captain Spitfire is loyal. I was merely hypothesizing—"\n\n"She is, Princess. Background checks, service record, family hi—" Raven cut herself off. With a sad smile, she declared, "I'll clear your schedule. You need some YOU time, Princess. You must relax."\n\nCelestia stared at her. Finally, she hung her head and groaned."

  solarreworked.58.d:0 ""And I'm telling you, she won't do anything more! We can offer her—" Twilight Sparkle began, although she quickly huffed when she was interrupted by Neighsay, who was standing across from her.\n\n"Please, Princess," he started with a smug snort, "you've already proven that you and that circus of a school can't do proper vetting. She should be tried to the fullest extent of our laws, and languish in prison until her chitin rots!" As he finished, Neighsay stomped harshly on the floor of the Canterlot Castle throne room, although it was muffled by the carpet that was on top of it. Furrowing his brow, he marched a pace or two toward Twilight, who flared her wings defensively. "If you cannot perform basic changeling checks on new students, I suggest that you recuse yourself and—"\n\n"Enough! Both of you!" Celestia interjected, which made them both jump in surprise. She scowled. As she sized both of them up for a moment, she watched as Twilight blushed and tittered, while Neighsay stuttered a couple of times. He remained quiet when she glared at him.\n\nMane whipping about, Celestia rose from her throne and trotted down toward the pair. Cantering in a circle once around both of them, she huffed, "You come to me to break a stalemate, and you still bicker like foals laying blame on each other?" Twilight and Neighsay flinched. Celestia sighed. She massaged her temples. "Twilight, this changeling was at your school for how long?"\n\n"About four months." When she finished, Twilight scratched the back of her head. "Well, four months, a week, and three days, but who's counting?" She laughed uncomfortably as Celestia and Neighsay stared back at her, deadpan. As Neighsay was about to speak, Twilight blurted out, "But she said she didn't have a choice! Sure, she wanted to help Chrysalis at first, but then she started making friends, and learning from our classes, and—"\n\n"And stealing valuable information that goes by YOUR desk, Princess." Leveling an accusing hoof at Twilight. "Oh, by all means, perhaps we should just leave your door unlocked at all times? Maybe a sign welcoming all undiscovered spies in, simply because it's the friendly thing to do?" In disgust, he wrinkled his muzzle and brayed furiously.\n\nFace growing red, Twilight snarled and snapped, "And she isn't going to do it anymore! She'll feed Chrysalis false information, and—"\n\n"Princess, with all due respect, the laws are clear. She should languish in jail for the rest of eternity." He shrugged. "Or Princess Celestia can bring back the wartime death sentence." Glancing over at Celestia, he added, "But I doubt she will." Although he didn't voice a question, Celestia flinched and swallowed hard. Darting her gaze between Twilight and Neighsay, her forehead throbbed and she groaned.\n\nIn the back of her mind, she questioned if Raven could have handled the meeting instead."

  solarreworked.59.d:0 "Chilled to the core, Celestia carefully trotted into the holding cell in one of the prefabricated military prisons near the front lines with [NLR.GetNameDef]. As she did, she held back a shudder as the single pony in the room, dressed in the military attire of [NLR.GetNameDef], gazed at her, without much emotion at all. In the back of her mind, she could still hear the doubtful tone of Major Tarimer, who had notified her about the captured officer. Colonel Posy Petal, who was most certainly not a thestral.\n\nAs she met Posy's glance, she felt her heart hitch and she held back a small swallow. A few scratches and bruises on Posy's neck and a rip or two on her uniform were the only indications of what had already taken place. So far, no information had been garnered from her, aside from the few hints on her person regarding some of the nearby armies' troop movements. If she had any of it, it was in her head.\n\nPutting on a disarming smile, Celestia quickly bowed her head. "Posy," she stated, which made Posy stiffen and narrow her eyes. "I regret that I wasn't able to arrive sooner, for I would have relieved Major Tarimer on this before he—" She gulped. Without finishing, she sighed and lit her horn. A couple of the bruises on Posy's neck faded.\n\nPosy arched a brow. "What trick is this?" she snorted. As she was chained to the table in the empty room, barring a single window letting in moonlight, she tried crossing her forearms, failed, and then leaned back in her chair instead. "I'm not going to say anything."\n\nCelestia gritted her teeth. "My little pony," she began, before she was cut off with Posy reciting her name, rank, and number. "My little pony," she interjected more forcefully as her mane started to whip around slightly. Her mind throbbed at processing Posy's stubborn refusal to speak. Didn't she know that Celestia was able to pardon her if she helped?\n\nWhen Posy had finished repeating her spiel a fifth time, Celestia slammed her hooves into the ground, sending out a spiderweb of cracks and snapped, "Quiet!" She powered her horn and forcefully closed Posy's mouth. As Posy protested, Celestia growled, a single eyelid twitching. "I want to offer you forgiveness. I want to save all of you. Because I want to save all of you, I need to know everything you can tell me about Luna's military plans." She smiled, although it was a tad unhinged. "I can offer you much, if you would only cooperate."\n\nFor a second, Posy thought, but finally shook her head.\n\nCelestia's eyelid twitched again."

  solarreworked.60.d:0 ""You absolute morons! Bucking idiots! Do you have any idea how—"\n\nPrincess Celestia closed her eyes and took a few deep, steadying breaths as the harsh bellow of Prince Blueblood carried through the air when she arrived at one of the forward camps on the front lines. Although it was certainly within active combat risk, it was considered safe enough that her desire to visit Blueblood had been agreed upon by the rest of the high command. Appearing before the troops would improve morale, after all.\n\nAs she heard her small retinue of guards tense at Blueblood's tirade, she merely raised a hoof to indicate they should remain at parade rest. It was only one of Blueblood's tantrums. More than likely it was about his afternoon tea or the like. She could sort it out, show her concern and love for everypony, and move on. Hopefully without seeing much of the results of the war.\n\nWith her mind's eye, she could visualize the gore and viscera after an artillery barrage. She didn't need to actually see it.\n\nAs she and her guards neared one of the camp's barracks, she spotted Blueblood rapidly stalking back and forth in front of a dozen soldiers. When she got close enough to spot his scowl, she could see one of his eyelids twitch every so often. His reddish cheeks belied his furious state. He glanced her way briefly and paused. "Auntie?" he inquired curiously.\n\nThere was a snicker from the soldiers.\n\n"Silence!" he shot back. "You absolute wastes of—"\n\n"Blueblood!" interjected Celestia. Gritting her teeth, she marched toward him and he squeaked and stepped back. She furrowed her brow. "What is going on here? I arrive to see you and encourage everypony, and you wish to tear them down?" She snorted. "What ideals are we holding to here? We—" She swallowed. "We had to abandon some, but we must treat—"\n\n"Auntie, with all due respect," Blueblood grumbled back. As a lock of his mane flopped onto the bridge of his nose from under his cap, he trotted toward her, his eyes flaming with anger. "But my troops are completely incapable. They must be shown SOME level of indignation, if they are to be—"\n\n"They are trying their best!" she interrupted again. With a peek behind her back, she met the gazes of the assembled soldiers, who were standing stock still. A few sweated. Focusing on Blueblood again, she stated, "Go lighter on them. What did military school to do you?"\n\n"It taught me that soldiers who make mistakes that weaken our ponypower, LIKE THESE, deserve punishment." He jutted his jaw defiantly. With a glare, he practically challenged Celestia to a response.\n\nAll she could mumble was, "Oh.""

  solarreworked.66.d:0 "The clock struck midday.\n\nWith a start, Princess Celestia looked up from the piles of paperwork that had slowly amassed over time on her desk. Outside her quarters, she could hear the hustle and bustle of the castle as servants went about their duties and guards patrolled for the security of all.\n\nShe blinked. Flicking a single ear a few times, she glanced over her shoulder. Despite the noise filtering in from the hallway, there was an eerie silence in her chambers, much like it was muffling or absorbing some of the sound. About the only thing that was clear was the ticking of the clock that she had placed on her desk. It was now one after twelve.\n\nGazing at it for a moment, she twitched one of her eyelids. A tightness gripped her chest like a vice. She glanced at the papers. Statistics. Battle reports. Authorization requests. Financial forecasts. All of that and more. Every last one had to pass by her, in case somepony thought they could do something without her approval. If it led to more harm for her ponies, then it'd still be her fault.\n\nShe nickered when there was a melodic caw to her left. Her heart racing, she whipped her head in the direction of the cry and exhaled softly when she saw it was Philomena. For a moment, the bright orange phoenix stared at her, a small look of concern on the bird's face. After a second, Philomena crooned again. She continued to peer at Celestia.\n\nHolding Philomena's eye, Celestia swallowed and stuttered, "I-I'm okay, Philomena. J-Just a bit—" She exhaled "—overworked."\n\nPhilomena cawed again, although this time, it sounded harsh. Grating. Celestia flattened hear ears.\n\n"Philomena! Young lady, I'd NEVER hurt my ponies!" blurted Celestia before she shook her head. Looking back to the phoenix, she frowned. A few strands of her mane started to curl outwards. Slamming a hoof on her desk, she barked, "I do all that I can to protect them!" Briefly after the retort, Philomena was silent. However, she still examined Celestia.\n\n"Oh, but have you? When the enemy is at Canterlot's gates, will you have done everything to protect them?" a low, feminine voice inquired. Jerking her attention back to Philomena, Celestia gawked at her pet. Philomena just tilted her head. She squawked curiously.\n\n"Did you—No. That's not possible." Celestia massaged her forehead. Maybe she was getting too invested into her work. A walk would do her good. Definitely.\n\nBut the voice had echoed her own thoughts. Was she doing everything she could? Peering out at the bright daytime, she could only shudder.\n\n"I need a drink," she finally mumbled. It was five o'clock somewhere, after all."

  solarreworked.67.d:0 "She felt hot.\n\nActually, no, not just hot, but in reality like she was burning up. Granted, she had spent the last three days in her quarters, pouring over some of the different reports from the front lines, and the latest information compiled by S.M.I.L.E., and also listened to the news briefings on the radio regarding all things Equestria, so perhaps she was just a bit under the weather.\n\nThat was it, Celestia ultimately concluded to herself as she stared at some sheets of paper, her bleary eyes barely registering what they were looking at. In the corner, where she had been moved to, Philomena crowed and cawed, although Celestia paid it little mind. She rapidly blinked the sleep away from her eyes. Was Philomena watching her intently, or was she just imagining that something was watching her?\n\nNo matter. She shrugged and rolled her shoulders, feeling them crack. On her desk, one of her inkwells had been knocked over at some point, although it had barely spilled anything. It had been practically emptied over a week ago. Or was it two weeks? Three?\n\nShe blinked away some more tiredness. Sweat trickled down her forehead.\n\nTrotting closer to her desk again, she folded her knees and bent down so that she was eye-level with the surface. On a map which had a few ink stains and some crumbs of cake and other confections, markers indicating the various army groups of her military and their foes were set up. She twitched.\n\n"If August were to take his army group here and—" She cut herself off. "No, no, could lead to tens of thousands of my ponies hurt. Starvation. Casualties." She nickered. Returning to the desk, she tried another movement. And another. And another. Each could yield catastrophic results, but she had to make SOME call.\n\n"My ponies need to be careful!" she tittered to herself as she began to simply make movements at random. Whatever felt right. Effectively all of it was to pincer the other side. Maybe... maybe they could have a few casualties. If it meant more would be saved in the end.\n\nGreater good, or something like that?\n\nChuckling to herself, she barely heard the door open after some commotion, and the voice of Neighsay begin, "Princess, I demand to be heard about Twilight Sparkle's latest—" He cut himself off. She didn't even look up from the map, in which she was effectively playing war.\n\nAfter a few seconds, he stated, nervously, "Y-You're obviously, erm, busy, Princess. I-I shall speak later."

Cracking an awkward smile, she placed the pot on the small table in their living room. When Daybreaker arched a brow, Posey adjusted her glasses and tittered uneasily. She poured a cup and passed it to Daybreaker, who merely gazed at it for a second before sipping on it.\n\n"Not to be rude, Your Grace, b-but why did you say you came again?" Posey's husband, Gentle Breeze, inquired with a quivering voice. He nervously switched his attention between the two guards that were standing at rapt attention at the entrance to the living room.\n\nAfter taking another drink of her tea, Daybreaker merely looked at him for a moment, then quipped, "Does your Empress require a reason to impose upon her subjects?"\n\n"No! Not at all! I'm merely confused why it would be US?" Gentle glanced between him and his wife. Although it was faint, there was a spark of worry in his eyes, beyond just being in the presence of his better.\n\nBefore Daybreaker could respond, the front door of the Shy's slammed and a carefree, young voice exclaimed, "Yo, Mom! Pops! I'm back from an aching long day. Won't ya come out here and help grab my stuff?" Seconds later, an aquamarine pegasus trotted into the room and gasped. "You're hosting a '"Welcome back, Zephyr" party?!' You shouldn't have!" He shot one glance at Daybreaker. "Heya, Hot Stuff."\n\nBraying indignantly, Daybreaker nodded her head and both guards darted to seize Zephyr. He let out a whinny of surprise, but stated, "You know, if you really like me that much—"\n\n"Silence, foal!" Daybreaker hissed. Bending down to stare him in the eyes, she growled, "As one of the Element Bearers' siblings, ponies look to you, whether you realize it or not."\n\nDaybreaker unfurled a letter. "Normally, draft dodging is below me, but in this case, I'll make an exception."\n\n"N-Now, I'm sure there's an explanation for—" Posey began before Daybreaker glared directly into her soul. She squeaked and went mute.\n\nSquinting, Zephyr inspected the letter while making a low hum. He shrugged, "Sorry, Hot Stuff. Not interested.

  solarreworked.101.d:0 ""Can't believe the nerve of her," Zephyr Breeze grumbled softly as he settled into a nook between a couple of trees. Twelve weeks of basic, just to be thrown a gun and then left out to rot on some smelly battlefield. Did they know how many grains of dirt he'd found underneath his hooves?! More than one! Couldn't even take a Celestia-foresaken nap around his sergeant without getting screamed at.\n\nThankfully no blood had gotten on him yet, but if he had to fight a bug or something with his bayonet, then all that ichor would stain him for months.\n\nSuddenly, a bullet whizzed by his head and broke his reverie. A second later, a couple of screams carried toward him, and he yawned as he tried to drown things out. Apparently there was some battle going on right now, but who cared? He needed to catch up on some zs, and his CO wasn't paying attention right now.\n\nHowever, between the noise of combat and the deep-seated anger he felt from that admittedly looker of an alicorn who hauled him off to boot camp, he could barely get any rest. Cracking an eye open, he grunted when it grew quiet, and he huffed before getting up and checking on the command post, which was nearby. Perhaps one of the nerds there could tell him of a nice hiding spot to snooze away the day.\n\nAfter weaving through a few corridors, which had klaxon sirens blaring, he spotted the quarters of the regiment's general, Cuff Link, and poked his head in. "Heya, General?" he asked, an idea coming to his mind. Nopony was there.\n\nGrinning from ear to ear, he slunk in and poked around in the wardrobe. Sure enough, there was a spare uniform, like he hoped there would be. After quickly donning, he turned around, and screamed when a soldier rushed into the room. However, the soldier saluted, and exclaimed, "General! You were reported killed in battle. What are you doing here?!"\n\nZephyr's mind raced. Sweat trickled down his neck. Stuttering, he fibbed, "W-Well, that's obviously because somepony who LOOKED like me was killed. I was here the entire time. Definitely." He cracked an uneasy smile.\n\nPanic etched into his face, the soldier grabbed him without questioning the lie. "Part of the line has been broken! We need you to direct its regrouping!" Before Zephyr could protest, he was grabbed by a hoof, and pulled toward the communications room. Zephyr could only sigh."

  solarreworked.102.d:0 "Kicking back in his office chair and sighing, Zephyr Breeze slipped his both his forelegs behind his head pressed as far as he could into the plush leather. In only a few weeks, he had completely transformed that stuffy, old room that the geezer before him had used into a hip and fun place. A few pictures—of himself, of course—an icebox with a selection of various ciders, and a pool table. Could still use a few more amenities, but it was a start.\n\nOutside his office, he could hear ponies rushing to and fro, and one mare quickly poked her head in to inquire, "Have you finished, General?"\n\n"Hm?" Zephyr cracked an eyelid open. "Oh, yeah, yeah!" Swiping a single page from his desk, which he spent all of maybe two seconds reading, he tossed it toward her. From the title, he thought it might have been something about fireworks, or the like.Something with some big booms. Maybe they were all using those giant guns a couple miles away for a show later.\n\n"What about the inventory reports on our current medical supplies?" the aide asked as she took the page in her magic.\n\n"Oh, uh, I gave that to Corporal, uh, Smudge or something," Zephyr mumbled as he started to slip back into sleep. Yawning, he muttered, "You know, delegation is key to success!" He spread his wings to stretch them, then waved her off. "You can go now. I'm just going to, uh, think on some new battle plans. Yeah!"\n\nDutifully, the mare left and his door clicked shut. For a few minutes, the hustle and bustle continued outside, but it soon grew disturbingly quiet as a few sets of hooves stomped toward his office. As the door slammed open, he sighed, "Yo, what'd I tell you about—"\n\nAs his vision cleared, he froze when he saw a unicorn with the exact same fur and mane color as him glowering at him, while standing between two guards, who were also looking outraged. The double, who was probably about fifteen years older, was missing part of an ear, and had a large gauze patch over half his face and neck. He wore a general's uniform.\n\nZephyr gulped. "Ah, General Link! I-I heard that you were KIA. But, uh, I see I was wrong." As the general's glower deepened, Zephyr spied the window in the office, and tensed. "I'd love to chat, but, uh, I kept your seat warm, and uh, I think I'll be going!" Leaping for the window, he punched through the glass, and was soon nothing more than a distant speck on the horizon."

  solarreworked.103.d:0 "It wasn't often that Refraction saw life along the border between [CRY.GetNameDef] and [EQS.GetNameDef]. With her station set along one of the few small settlements of [CRY.GetNameDef], she had a relatively quiet position. In the past, there had been an odd incident or two of an accused changeling infiltrator, before it was determined that it was just a unicorn with a mild allergy to magic. There was even a bugbear once, but it was being directed by Fluttershy to a safe nesting location, so it wasn't much of a threat.\n\nTherefore, when she caught some movement in the sky on her way back to her station for the evening, she frowned. Readying her rifle, she took aim and traced it as it grew larger. Soon enough, she could see it was a lanky pegasus. Since she was concealed by some of the shrubs in the wooded area near the town, she could watch him as he approached.\n\nHe seemed to be fleeing. Every so often, he'd glance over his shoulders like he was being pursued, but he wasn't being followed, from what she could see. When he was about three hundred feet out and above her, she stepped and called, "Halt! You're entering [CRY.GetAdjective] territory!" He screamed with a haggard gasp and noticed her. She held her gun at the ready.\n\nFreezing and looking at her gun, he obeyed and descended. When his hooves touched the earth, he collapsed and began to kiss it. "Thank Celestia!" he exclaimed when he stopped. "Finally somepony to help me!" Before Refraction could ask him anything, he grabbed both her shoulders and shook her. "They're after me! I-I barely made it out! I know they're hunting little ol' me!"\n\nShe pushed him back. Arching a brow, she demanded, "Who's hunting you?" Now that she was closer, she could tell he was wearing a rather sweat-drenched uniform of an [EQS.GetAdjective] officer. "Wait," she began. "Are you an [EQS.GetAdjective] soldier?" She tightened her grip on her rifle.\n\nFor a second, he blinked at her, and then he bobbed his head up and down frantically. "Y-Yeah, totally! Five star gen-er-RAL!" He fluttered his lashes at her innocently. "They were cramping my style, so I said, 'No thanks, buckos!' and then they just started chasing me!" He hopped up. "Super important pony, after all." He shot her a smug grin. "Probably sent a whole army after me."\n\n"Right..." she muttered. "Well, it'll have to be verified, but if you're an [EQS.GetAdjective] general..." Pausing for a second, she finally quipped, "I think we have a job for you.""

Reaching vainly to her coffee cup, she groaned and hung her head before she put down the clipboard, then leaned over to grab it. She swiped at air, which made her look back up to blink in surprise. Then she heard a loud, long slurp as the other pony—correction, one of the other ponies—guzzled HER coffee. She snarled.\n\nWhen his eyes locked with hers, he stopped mid-slurp and just looked at her. He wiggled his eyebrows playfully.\n\n"Private, is there a reason you're still in here with your—" Petal eyed him again "—your general?"\n\n"Don't worry about her, Glitter Glow—"\n\n"That isn't even close to my name."\n\n"Whatever." The stallion waved a hoof dismissively. To her consternation and rapidly skyrocketing migraine, he leaned back on his chair and kicked his hind hooves up on the table. The interrogation table. Not that he really seemed to treat the offices of [CRY.GetAgency]'s with much respect. Or really the offices of anything in [CRY.GetNameDef] that well, from what she saw on her clipboard.\n\nIf it weren't because he was, from what they could verify, a general in [EQS.GetNameDef]'s military, he would have probably been looking at a dishonorable discharge, at best.\n\nWith a long, exasperated sigh, she rubbed her temples for a second or two, then looked at her clipboard. She had to double check his name. Zephyr Sneeze. Straightening her papers, she asked him, "General, if we may begin?"\n\n"Hmm?" he inquired, as he was looking at one of the rank stripes on his [CRY.GetAdjective] uniform. "Oh, sure, shiny stuff. But you didn't need to take me here to—"\n\n"Stuff it," she huffed, then flipped through a couple more pages. "All right, so, now that we finally have the bandwidth, what can you tell us about some of [EQS.GetLeader]'s battle plans? Troop compositions? Research projects?" With each question, Zephyr's posture grew more discomforted and he started to wriggle uneasily. "Anything? You said you were a 'top-top-brass.'" She furrowed her brow. "So?"\n\n"Uh, well, you know, when I said that I meant, actually, uh—" Zephyr pulled on his collar, then spotted one of small windows in the room. "I meant I was FRIENDS with one, and uh—" Before he finished, he bolted from his seat and dove straight for the window. Crashing through the glass, he took to the skies and was a blip on the horizon in no time at all."

  solarreworked.105.d:0 ""And you picked him up where?" Commissar Kirov inquired one of his underlings as he stalked through the corridors of the small outpost between [STG.GetNameDef] and [CRY.GetNameDef]. As they passed a small portrait of Steel Stallion, they both saluted before continuing on.\n\nThe private was uncomfortably waffling between a few different ways to start. Between all the uhs, ahs, ums, and wells, he did get out that they picked up the [CRY.GetAdjective] officer up right on the border. Apparently, he was staggering around, and claimed he hadn't had a drink of water in seven weeks, which was simply absurd. Also, when he had seen it was a [STG.GetAdjective] patrol, he then started saying all he needed was vodka. And also began speaking in a thick, stereotypical, [STG.GetAdjective] accent.\n\n"Right," Kirov grunted as he dismissed the peon. By now, they had gotten to the outpost's one interrogation room, and he began to observe the prisoner from behind the one-way mirror. Certainly, he appeared to be a [CRY.GetAdjective] officer, given the rather ragged uniform which he was wearing. Still, he was an Equestrian, given the complete lack of crystal shine. Those were rare.\n\nScratching his chin, Kirov huffed and brushed back some of his dark blue mane before entering. As soon as the officer heard him enter, the stallion ran to him and begged, "Please! I need some hoof trimmers. Poor ol' me hasn't have a good hooficure in AGES!" He coughed. Suddenly in a thick, movie-like accent, he also inquired, "Uh, and comrade, get me an entire bottle of wodka. Da?"\n\nKirov glowered at him.\n\nCoughing into a hoof, the stallion tittered, "W-Well, ah, I thought that'd go better in my head."\n\nIn perfect Equestrian, with little inflection, Kirov grunted, "I speak your language fine, capitalist lackey. Do not insult my intelligence."\n\n"O-Oh, buddy, I'm not ANYPONY'S lackey," he stated while wrapping a hoof around Kirov's neck. "You know, I always said, 'Zephyr uh... Cheese, don't let nopony cramp yer style,' and I am one free soul!" He smiled widely at Kirov and added, "Totally thought outside the box and just—" He whistled and whipped his hoof up high. "Shot straight to the top."\n\n"Right..."\n\n"And can I like, stay here for a while?" With an innocent grin, he rapidly fluttered his eyelids. "Please?! I may be chased by uh, you know, them."\n\n"Oh, so a traitor, hmm?" Kirov muttered as he rubbed his chin thoughtfully. Clearing his throat, he snapped and pushed Zephyr off him. "I will speak to my superiors. They have use for you after all." He sneered. "I'd suggest you accept it. It beats being shot."\n\nZephyr gulped."

Rolls off the tongue so much better.'" As Zephyr Breeze finished his statement, Zephyr let out a small chuckle as he went back to eating around the table with a few other [STG.GetAdjective] officers. From the absolute stunned silence that he received, he figured that his tall tale had impressed them.\n\nWhen he had finished slurping down some his Shchavel, he coughed and had to bite down a gag at the rather hearty, earthy taste of the dish. However, he stomached it, as he noticed he was getting a few stares. In fact, even after he had suppressed his gag reflex, he was still being gawked at.\n\nA couple of the officers, all at least majors, glared at him. One other was spitting and fuming, and had managed to bend the spoon he held in his teeth visibly.\n\nBy now, most of the officers' mess had quieted down and were looking in his direction, which made him shift and shuffle on his seat. Did he sit in a bit of spilled Svekonlik or something? Was he looking like he'd been shot by that weird, cold, beet soup?\n\nDarting his gaze around the room, he tittered, "Come on, guys, I was just telling a little funny, okay? Ol' Zephyr Cheese needs to let loose with a funny one every now and then, right?"\n\n"You DARE insult the legacy of Steel Stallion and Comrade Marks?!" one of the officers at his table finally spat. Slamming both of her hooves down on the table, she catapulted the rest of Zephyr's soup into his face. She narrowed her eyes. "Not only are you capitalist filth whose leash has been kept too loose, but you now mock the greatest ponies of the Revolution?!" She bore her teeth.\n\n"Woah, come on now, uh, Creepy Rose—"\n\n"Crimson Rose."\n\n"Right, Crying Rose." Zephyr hastily started to back off his seat. Out of the corner of his eye, he spied a window nearby and tensed.\n\n"I'll end your mockery here and now!" Crimson screamed as she pulled a pistol from its holster. In the few seconds it took her to grab it and aim, he already sprang to the window, though, and, in a shatter of glass, he dove through it. Within moments, he was nothing more than a small dot in the sky."

  solarreworked.107.d:0 ""Name?" Evening Posy inquired as she tiredly rolled her eyes at the pony who approached her seaport customs booth. It wasn't enough that she had to suffer in the heat of a scorching summer in Sunset, but she had to still endure all the wackjobs that tried to come into [EQC.GetNameDef]. Even before he opened her mouth, she knew it was going to be good. Given the almost nauseating amount of fish smell that was radiating off him, and the grizzled, harrowed expression that he had on his face, now doubt he was going to spin some story about fleeing [STG.GetNameDef] or that he was running from [EQS.GetNameDef]'s military. Wasn't like she heard that a few dozen times before.\n\nHe hacked and coughed a couple of times. Beneath some of his grime, she could see a glint of something metallic, possibly a rank pauldron. Then again, it could have been fish guts or something. Certainly he smelled like it.\n\n"Please, ya gotta let me in, okay? I need a shower, all right?" he begged as he threw himself at her booth.\n\n"Uh-huh. Name?" She tapped on a sheet of paper with a pencil.\n\n"Uh... Zephyr Freeze."\n\n"Point of origin?"\n\nAt that, he paused for a second and then muttered, "Mare, you wouldn't even believe me if I told you."\n\n"I've heard it all, bud." With that statement, she reached into the cubby of her booth, under the surface he was resting upon, and pulled out an apple. Loudly biting into it, she munched on it and slowly smacked. Each time she chewed, his left eyelid twitched. "Hit me with your sob story."\n\n"Y-You don't know how horrible and filthy that griffon trawler was! We went around the entire coast of Griffonia and—" Shuddering again, he whimpered, "We only ate RAW fish!" Miming a retch or two, he pleaded, "P-Please, little ol' Zephyr just needs a warm bed! I-I'll do anything! I-I, uh, fled from [STG.GetNameDef]."\n\nShe glanced down at his shoulders again. "You one of them commies, mate?"\n\n"W-What? No! I-I was, uh, undercover, yeah!" As soon as he finished his thought, some of his panic disappeared, and he brushed back his rather stringy blond mane. "I was TOTALLY working for [CRY.GetAgency], yeah. You know, if you let me in, I'll put in a good word with you with Princess Cadance once I get back, honey."\n\nPerking up, she leaned in and hissed, "Oh, sure, I'll keep your secret safe." Hitting a button under her booth, she added, "I think some of our military boys will want a word or two with you.""

  solarreworked.108.d:0 ""General Freeze, if I may have a word with you?"\n\nAs soon as those words were uttered, Zephyr's head shot up from above the back of the couch that he was currently... checking his eyes for cracks from. He smacked his lips. Where had his lovely assistant, Acacia wandered off to? She still had all of his vacation day approvals for himself to sign and okay.\n\n"Now!" the cross voice of Moonlight Poppy demanded again. Instantly flinching and hopping off of his couch—five minutes later—he sauntered over Moonlight Poppy's office. She was in the middle of organizing a few papers, and a large map of [EQC.GetNameDef] was stretched out across the wall behind her. The sole marshal of [EQC.GetNameDef]'s forces eyed him warily over her steepled hooves. Despite her rose which always seemed to be in her mane, she appeared like a huntress ready to end her target's existence.\n\n"Sit down," she commanded.\n\nIn the back of Zephyr's mind, he already mapped how he could get to the window behind her. It would probably have to be fast.\n\n"Now!" she barked, which made him jump and do as she ordered. He sat straight, with his chest protruding as about as far as he could push it in a display of pride. Pride in showing off his medals. Hopefully she'd be awed by them and forget why she called him in.\n\nHowever, she was too sharp. "Now, 'General' Freeze, we have finally received word from [CRY.GetNameDef] regarding your story."\n\n"Oh, you asked them about little ol' me?" Zephyr squeaked, which earned a nod from her. "Ho—Daytime Petal, you shouldn't have. Could have blown my whole cover vibe going on."\n\nShe arched a brow. Scribbling something on a notepad, she muttered aloud, "Evasive and deflective. Purposefully forgets names..." She looked back up and stated, "I knew I should have trusted my gut, but it isn't easy keeping in touch with Equus." Falling silent for a second, she huffed, "But now with all of their information on a Zephyr SNEEZE, and you're absolutely STELLAR job at delegation, I'm beginning to think—" Before she could finish, Zephyr breyed in fear and used his wings to spring up from the chair.\n\nBarreling directly into her, he managed to squeeze by, and dove for the window. With a shattering of glass, he fell to the ground a few feet below before scrambling up and flapping furiously. By the time Midnight had regained her senses, he was little more than a dust grain in the sky."

At least, that's where he believed he was, since he did see some of the lights of an underwater city in the coastline, shortly before crash landing from exhaustion. Escaping [EQC.GetNameDef] had taken every last bit of wit that he had, and hopping the ocean from cloud to cloud, with as little food as he could carry or drag up from the ocean's surface, though.\n\nStill, he was free, and he continued to allow the late afternoon sun to beat down on him, drying him out and making him rather itchy from the salt. No more soldiery. No more running from Daybreaker. Just him, his stylish mane, and his unbeatable charms. Maybe he could find a job here. Something that could really challenge him. Like monster hunting or deep sea diving! Those sounded fun.\n\nAt the moment, though, his body ached to the point of wanting to completely collapse. He held back a yawn. Flopping his wings out, he twitched a couple of times and soon began to snore.\n\nHe jerked awake when something poked into his flank. In his hazy mind, he could barely make out the shape of something looking over him. He screamed. "Don't eat little, ol' Zephyr! I-I taste like... I taste like seaweed!"\n\n"That actually sounds yummy," a young voice chirped excitedly. At that, he looked up and saw a young hippogriff colt... chick? Either way, a male hippogriff youth. He stared at Zephyr. "You're alive! I thought you were dead! Ponies don't normally wash up on shore, unless there's been a shipwreck."\n\nHe gasped. "Hey! Were you attacked by pirates?!" For a moment, he took in Zephyr's uniform and squealed, "Were you on a [EQC.GetNameDef] ship?! They're almost as cool as ours!"\n\nMind working rapidly, Zephyr frantically nodded and stuttered, "Y-Yeah, kid. I was the, uh, admiral of the ship, uh, HMS, uh... Moon...tail?"\n\nWithout giving him a chance to continue, the hippogriff crowed in joy and declared, "My uncle will want to talk with you! He could help you find a place in our army, unless they want you back!"\n\n"Nope! Definitely don't need to go back!" Zephyr whined as he was dragged off."

Occasionally, he'd steal glance behind him, or at least from what he could do for a split second and without turning his head. Sky Beak merely got up, closed the door, and sat back down. For easily a minute, his office was silent, and he eventually adjusted the picture of himself and his daughter, Silverstream.\n\n"I've read some interesting things, Lieutenant General Fleas," Sky Beak quipped nonchalantly as he moved forward a page that was on his desk. "Many interesting things about those feats and medals you earned back in [EQC.GetNameDef] and [EQS.GetNameDef]."\n\n"Oh, sir," Zephyr let out with a small sigh, "You have no IDEA how much I had to work for those. They told me—you know what they said? They said, 'Zephyr, you're just an ol' pegasus. No way you could—'"\n\n"Cut the chatter, Zephyr," Sky Beak suddenly snapped, which made Zephyr instantly shut his trap. With a firm frown, Sky looked over his talons again and huffed, "Your claims impressed me at the time when my nephew found you, but after your 'brilliant' strategy in opening fire on our OWN troops in Zumidia as a scare tactic, I did a little digging."\n\nZephyr started to sweat. "O-Oh? I-I was allowed, you know, to think outside the box. A-And all my other guys, t-they thought—"\n\n"They simply followed your commands," Sky interjected. With Zephyr silenced, he shoved the paper on the desk forward. "Interesting that there was no 'Battle of Battlecorn,' and there is no 'Pink Heart of Heraldry and Niceness' like you claimed. AMONG OTHERS." At that, Sky's frown grew into a scowl. "And, there is apparently an old, outstanding issue for a deserting 'Zephyr Breeze' in [EQS.GetNameDef], who impersonated an officer." Arching a brow, he inquired, "You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?"\n\n"Uh, well, you see, I, uh, have a lot of, uh, identical siblings?" Zephyr stammered. He looked behind Sky, and his eyes glittered. "But, uh, I have to, uh, go!" At that, he sprang from his seat, crashed into Sky, scrambled back up, and then dove straight through the window behind Sky.

At least, she figured it was a thestral. Had the fangs. Had the wings, although he wiggled them consistently. Maybe he wasn't quite a full breed, since his eyes were just like hers. With a smile, he leaned in and looked at her. "And I will say that I can do all of this science stuff."\n\nHe jabbed a hoof at her. "Need me to pour beakers together? All over it!

"Okay, Zephyr, and what makes you think that you're even CLOSE to qualified for what we're doing here?"\n\n"So, I was TOTALLY undercover in [HIP.GetNameDef] for a few weeks, and they definitely didn't notice me slip out with all their super-secret research papers." At that, he leaned back and smugly smirked at her. He crossed his arms. "Beat that."\n\n"Did you bring back these so-called papers for analysis?"\n\nBlinking a couple of times, Zephyr scratched the back of his head. "Huh, well, I would say this is a bit embarrassing, but I just did it for fun, Light Zoom."\n\n"Night Bloom."\n\n"Right, Flight Doom." With a dismissive wave of his hoof, he gave a posh and annoyed huff. "Aside from that, well, I, ugh, am a hard worker, and, uh, I like mangoes?" When she arched a brow at him, he stretched his smile wide. She flipped through a few more papers with her magic. Definite imbecile. Most likely pathological liar. Actually fit most of the boxes. Perfect gopher for the project ahead.\n\nShe smacked away one of his hooves that was reaching toward hers, and then she stated, "Well, Zephyr Trees, I didn't think it at first, but you actually hit our qualifications.

Chittering instinctively in annoyance, he fixed the half-breed with an infuriated scowl and then marched to another table in the laboratory.\n\n"Zephyr!" Night Bloom barked, which caused the aquamarine thestral to jerk up in surprise with a small snort. Although he continued to stare at her dumbly, she simply snapped, "Get Dr. Blut the LARGE beaker."\n\n"The comically large beaker?"\n\n"What?" She gawked at him, completely nonplussed.\n\n"Oh, silly me, I thought I'd just lighten the mood with whatever... science stuff you guys are doing." With a small gasp, he hopped to his hooves, as he had been resting against one of the refrigerators, and inquired, "Say, do you mind if I tidy you guys up while you work? I am a master with the hooves." For a quick second, he flashed her a smile and held up both his forehooves. "Make sure we all look good for our pictures, of course."\n\n"Do you even know what we're researching here?! This is all top-secret! Even [BAT.GetNameDef] hasn't been informed about it yet." Stepping a couple of inches closer to Zephyr, she snarled, "Get the beaker. NOW!"\n\nScrambling back, Zephyr stammered, "I'll j-just find Malady and—"\n\n"No! You. Beaker. Science. NOW!"\n\nZephyr squeaked weakly and saluted with a wing. Then it fell off. Or, specifically, the leathery covering that was over a PEGASUS wing did. The false wing of painted wood and leather clattered to the ground. In an instant, all three peered at it, and Zephyr's face drained of color.\n\nNight Bloom looked back up at him. She narrowed her eyes.\n\nStuttering and mumbling, Zephyr started to inch toward a window that let in a bit of light. "Ah, well, you see, I, uh, was only PART thestral on my step-mother's side, and, maybe, I, uh—" With his distraction complete, he dove for the window, and immediately crashed into the iron bars on the inside of it.\n\nBoth Blut and Bloom stared at him, the latter's left eye twitch in shock, and Zephyr got up. Shaking himself, he tittered, grinned widely, and quietly departed out the lab's door.\n\n"What the buck just happened?"

Slowly, the light cloud that he had brought down to his humble lean-to fluttered in a light, warm wind. For the first time in he didn't know how long, he was finally at peace.\n\nSure, his parents probably thought he was dead. Fluttershy was worried sick about him, and Rainbow Dash was probably beside herself in hysterics about the thought of never seeing him again, but he was at least safe.

No more fraying clothes making him feel icky—although he did have a nice collection of medals from his adventures—and no more being bossed around.\n\nHe was the boss of his own life now!\n\nIf he had to reflect on the last few years, it'd be one of contentment. And theft, but he didn't need to think about that. It was more like "permanent borrowing" of food, anyway. It meant he could lounge around thinking and soaking up the sun, since staying so far outside of any civilization meant that the risk of being found by... HER were slim to none.\n\nAs he briefly envisioned that fiery alicorn, he shivered. Sure, she was hot—literally—but being taken back to that army again? No thanks.\n\nScreaming, he leapt out of his cloud as his reverie was shattered by an earth-shaking explosion. In the distance, a shower of dust and smoke filled the air, and more soon followed. Within short order, some soldiers of [BAT.GetNameDef] took to the air. Soon, even more started fleeing in the opposite direction of the blasts.\n\nHowever, as he was about to lie back down, a chill zipped down his spine as he saw few new soldiers march forwrad. It was [EQS.GetNameDef]! He could recognize those white uniforms anywhere.\n\nQuivering, he froze on the spot, then gasped. In a burst of blood-red magic, a tall, imposing figure appeared in front of some troops. Her armor glinted in the sunlight, and her fiery mane raged against the backdrop of the earth. Daybreaker was here! She was looking right at him!\n\nShe'd come for him!\n\nYears of repressed fear seizing him in an instant, Zephyr shrieked and peeled off into the sky. At his speed and distance, he failed to notice Daybreaker's confused frown as he disappeared from view, forever running from the pony who would have him fight."

  solarreworked.120.d:0 "Stalking through the radiant halls of the Kaiserschloss of Griffenheim, Daybreaker could barely withhold a self-satisfied smirk from breaking across her muzzle. It was a sweet irony, to see [GRD.GetNameDef] rise by the point of a sword, only for it to come crumbling down from years of decay, undermining, and politics. Even its resurgence, which she had to admit, wasn't entirely expected, was clearly a last gasp by a dying creature.\n\nAs if to emphasize her thoughts, she saw a grand, sprawling mural of Grover II, depicting his various campaigns across the continent. Conveniently, it ignored the fact that it was a pony who ended the fool. She merely held back a chuckle at it. If Grover II was alive, he would have been appalled at the resplendent lives of his descendants. True, he led life as a noble, but he had been a warrior at heart.\n\nWith her entertainment quota fulfilled, she marched toward her objective: the doors to the young Grover's chambers. She nodded to her two guards that were stationed on either side of them, and she entered. Already, her magic was readied for a surprise attack, but none came. Instead, Grover merely sat by his window. When she entered, he closed his book he was reading and readjusted his glasses.\n\n"What do you want?" he demanded rather testily in a faint Griffenheim accent. A few molting feathers fell off his adolescent face. "You have already bested us. Do you wish to kill me?" He straightened and puffed out his chest, but she could see him quiver faintly in fear. "You won't find me groveling for mercy."\n\nBearing her fangs and chortling, Daybreaker shook her head and clucked, "No, no, my little... griffon. You misunderstand my intentions."\n\n"Really? I have read the reports on what has happened in Equestria," Grover responded with a huff. Daybreaker suppressed a snarl at the mention of her nation's old name.\n\n"What's happened in MY EMPIRE is none of your concern." Trotting closer to him and letting her mane flap about and bathe his chambers in an orange glow, she stated, "But you shall learn in time that my decisions were only for my ponies' protection." As he flared his wings defensively, she sneered and added, "You shall learn much from me."\n\n"Where is [GetGriffonRegent]?!" he demanded. "If [GRD.GetLeader.GetSheHe] has been harmed, I'll—"\n\n"[GRI.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] is... indisposed, little griff," Daybreaker chortled.

  solarreworked.121.d:0 "The Sun rose high upon the ancient city of Griffonstone. Amidst the cobbled streets and winding alleyways of the homeland of the griffons, a varied procession of ponies and griffons marched toward the ceremonial coronation hall, formerly the kingly palace of Grover I, and later, of his blood relatives, the Gutos, which reached up to the heavens above the other, destitute buildings of the old metropolis, cutting like a gleaming knife through hot butter.\n\nAlthough the procession itself was a rather proud affair, none of the griffons that had been assembled to spectate made noise. Interspersed throughout, easily noticeable by the wake they created, armed pony soldiers, dressed in brilliant white parade uniform, watched for signs of dissent.\n\nIn the middle of the procession, Daybreaker slowly, haughtily, cantered. For once, instead of wearing her armor, she was adorned in a shimmering golden gown, which trailed behind her and was kept clean through various enchantments. Casting her gaze around her observers, she only sneered in amused contempt at their searing glares. Whatever they thought mattered not, for soon they would be able to question her even less than they already could.\n\nIn only a couple of minutes, the parade had finally reached the entrance to the coronation hall, the pillars of which glistened in the noonday sun. Briefly, Daybreaker remained stationary at the steps of the hall, looking back at the statue of Grover I that they had passed. Its chipped and eroded made her chuckle. Such a fitting picture of an aging empire.\n\nInside the hall, the domed roof permitted the full display of the Sun's beauty to come through. Ahead of the ceremony, perfectly clear crystal chalices, chandeliers, and every other item that could be conceived were set up for the noble guests. She barely registered it, though, as she suppressed a cackle when she saw Grover VI and his regent, [GRD.GetLeader], along with one of the Griffonstone nobles, waiting for her on the dais.\n\nSauntering her way toward the dais after waiting for the choir of griffons to be convinced to pronounce her entrance, she nodded once to the noble, and merely shot Grover a self-assured smirk. Surprisingly, the young griff remained restrained, and kept his face from displaying any emotion. However, she could see in his eyes that he was fighting between furious, combative, and resigned.\n\nIt didn't take long for her goal to be retrieved. The glimmering crown of the Grovers soon was escorted toward the dais, and she bore her teeth in delight. With a single sigh, she took it, placed it upon her head, and waited.\n\nThe only applause she received was dead silence."

"I will force feed you if it comes to it." Grover didn't bother replying, though, as he continued to just listlessly fiddle with one of the pieces of food on his plate.\n\n"And if I refuse?" he muttered in response, giving Daybreaker a side-eye and munching on one of the pieces of liver that was displayed on the plate. "You'll finally kill me, like I thought all along?"\n\nDaybreaker rolled her eyes. Finishing her salad, she huffed, "Preposterous! I would have no reason!"\n\n"Other than being a bloodthirsty murderer?" retorted Grover, which earned a raised eyebrow from her. "Do not intend to lie to me about what goes on in Equestria. Your toadies that you leave in your place while you're away blab even when I'm around." He snorted. "They must believe I'm still a chick."\n\n"Bold of you to tell me you spy on conversations that don't concern you," Daybreaker snarled, her mane momentarily flaring a slightly hotter yellow. However, Grover didn't flinch, and the additional light and heat from her soon dissipated. Pushing aside a couple of scrolls which she had been reading in between spurts of conversation, she stated, "But I'm feeling benevolent today."\n\n"How exciting." Grover returned to reading his book, his plate mostly uneaten.\n\nGritting her teeth, Daybreaker grunted, "If you are so curious regarding the state of my empire, then you will begin your education now."\n\n"You do realize that I've been receiving tutelage for over a decade now, no? My education—"\n\n"Is not sufficient," she cut in as she waltzed toward him. In her magic, she brought both her scrollsdropped them into his lap. "Read them. Give me your ruling," she ordered, her tone harsh and commanding.\n\nMomentarily, he stared at her, the faintest hint of fear revealing itself in his raised hackles. He scanned the scrolls. From what he could tell, they were two reports of captured prisoners, one from [EQS.GetNameDef], one from [GRD.GetNameDef].\n\n"The value stolen isn't much. I would... probably give them a small sentence and then release them," he stated. As there was a burst of flame from the liver on his plate, he jumped in shock.\n\n"Incorrect. They will both steal again. The pony has been captured on thirteen charges, the griffon has been in your jails three times." With a smarmy grin, she inquired, "It appears you need a better education after all, don't you think?""

For a moment, it was like the hustle and bustle of Griffenheim, in which they had decided to traverse to see the citizenry—under armed guard—had faded away in an instant. Her horn was still glowing, its blood-red hue casting a few faint reflections on the young griffon, who was looking back at her. He was unreadable.\n\n"F-F-Feel free t-to take as m-much as you w-want, your Excellencies," a female griffon shopkeep, whom Daybreaker had already relieved of one of her trinkets to inspect, stammered while giving a quick bow.\n\n"I had already planned as much," Daybreaker shot back at the griffon before vanishing the small necklace into the ether with a poof of energy. Grover still confidently stood watching her. Arching a brow, Daybreaker inquired of him, "Did I hear you correctly, griff?"\n\nNodding, Grover simply stated, "You're the one always claiming to be so talented and powerful." He ruffled his wings impatiently. "I've read about some earth ponies who could manipulate the earth as well as any unicorn. Who's to say that griffons cannot learn the same?"\n\n"Biology. Mageology. Myself." For each point, Daybreaker lightly rapped a hoof on the street. Some griffons who noticed the pair and the guards around them gave them a wide berth, which allowed her to speak freely and clearly. "Do not delude yourself. You should return to your other books. Not magic."\n\n"Yet I wish to learn," he insisted, his beak beginning to curl into a frown. "It's not as if I went into this without research." Stepping a smidgen closer, he gazed up at her and repeated with a small huff. "Teach me magic!"\n\nBriefly, Daybreaker stared back at him, her mind's gears turning. He puffed out his chest. Although the display made him look a tad ridiculous, especially standing up to somepony of her stature, she withheld a chuckle, yet a smirk built upon her muzzle all the same. "Very well," she stated with a bow. "I acquiesce to your forceful request."\n\nShe forced back another snicker as a flash of pride filled his eyes. "We shall begin our lessons now."\n\n"'Now?'" he repeated, before he was blindsided by an incredibly light blast of magic, no more than a slap, across the cheek.\n\nShe grinned. "Come, griff.

Stationed at the entrance to the throne room, as well as on either side of the dais up to the throne, [EQS.GetAdjective] soldiers stood rigidly at attention, potentially more than usual, given that they were within the presence of their Empress.\n\nIn Grover's mind, he couldn't imagine the last time they were this on edge. Even other times that Daybreaker had visited for her duties as regent, she didn't instill as much fear as he saw in them now. As he adjusted his glasses, he studied one of the soldiers closely, noting many of the hidden emotions that were forcing their way out. Subtle cues: tightened jaw, slight working of the teeth, a small fidget in the left hind leg. All indicated that, not only was this pony fearful, he was furious. Most likely upset at being stationed here, not that he'd admit it near his Empress.\n\nAs his mind wandered, he was broken from his observation as Daybreaker cast a small field of magic on some of his hackles, and he growled testily. She straightened them out and grunted, "Silence. I do not wish to be here any more than you do, griff."\n\n"And you did not need to attend, pony," he grumbled in return as she fixed a slight crease in his uniform. When she finished, he huffed and brushed off the topcoat which he wore, which clinked with a few medals that he'd yet to actually earn. Meanwhile, she was gowned in a fire orange dress, and eschewed her normal regalia. In front of them both, a trembling griffon who was hurriedly setting up various mirrors near a camera to reflect the light darted glanced at them occasionally.\n\nDaybreaker scoffed at his statement. "I am your regent. I believe I deserve to be acknowledged."\n\n"I am old enough to—"\n\n"Enough babbling," she interrupted with a hiss, which only earned a glare from him. "This matter is settled. The Empire must see its rulers."\n\n"Or its ruler and her puppet," he quipped back as the photographer motioned for them to stand back. When they were lined up with the throne to create a background with it between them, the griffon made them stop, and Grover furrowed his brow.\n\n"Smile, griff," Daybreaker hissed, just as they were both blinded by the flash of the camera.\n\nHe didn't comply."

Or, as it was now called, Sanctum Solar, although he had heard a number of ponies whisper it as "Imperial Center" or simply "Equestria." Every turn he took in the wake of Daybreaker presented some new sight, either of a renovation of one of the public buildings, a new site for some grand structure, or an already-existing masterpiece.\n\nAlthough Canterlot had always been a center of culture for ponies, much of what he had read in his earlier studies were woefully out of date, it appeared. However, it wasn't hard to notice that ponies always cast wary gazes at him, and more specifically, Daybreaker. She didn't appear to mind.\n\nAlong with the armed guard of soldiers protecting them, she could probably deal with most threats by herself. Whereas he, while able to do more than a griffon normally could—especially thanks to the projection device he helped design—he would have been helpless.\n\n"Impressive, is it not, griff?" Daybreaker inquired as she stopped in front of a striking statue of herself carved out of pure, white marble. Her orange mane reflected lightly off its surface.\n\nWith a slow nod, Grover admitted his agreement. She didn't bother to wait for him to chip in and instead quipped, "And so much of it built by who would otherwise be dregs in society."\n\n"You mean the destitute?"\n\nShe scoffed. "Please. They have done nothing wrong, although you are not entirely wrong." Flashing her fangs, she rapped a hoof against the statue and declared with a hint of pride, "No, these were built by those who were useless to us. The criminally insane. The rebel." She laughed. "Rather than waste bits on their jails, they can simply build these for practically free!"\n\n"Is that not inhumane? Driving them as slaves—"\n\n"They're hardly slaves. It is merely a consequence of their actions." Daybreaker arched a brow and approached Grover. He straightened, looking her in the eye, and she shot him a smirk. "If I recall correctly, even [GRD.GetNameDef] has menial labor for criminals." Her mane flapped rapidly. "I don't see this as any different, do you? How do you think crime is so low in my empire? Is it not my responsibility to ensure the stability and protection of my ponies' lives?"\n\nBiting his tongue, Grover finally sighed and looked away."

While he had waited, he had nervously preened at a couple of loose feathers on a wing. If had a book with him, he would have been reading that instead.\n\nEspecially since whenever he thought about the myriad laws of [GRD.GetNameDef], it gave him a headache.\n\nHopping off of the throne, he stood for a moment to stare out the windows at Griffenheim. Snow dotted the rooftops, and he could see the wind swirling small wisps of the white stuff through the streets. Coldness radiated from the glass. He shivered.\n\nWhether it was from the proceedings of the previous case, or simply from a chill, he couldn't say. After letting out another groan, he traipsed toward the exit doors, which were opened by a pair of pony guards. Almost immediately he was hit with a wave of warmth, and he paused when he saw Daybreaker standing in the entrance, clearly waiting for him.\n\nAn unamused grimace plastered her face. Likewise, her mane whipped wildly. Rather than a typical orange, it was a bright yellow, with a few hints of blue. She bore her teeth."What have I taught you these last months?!" she demanded, marching toward him to tower over him. He merely stared, solemnly, back at her. However, a tendril of ice slithered down his back as he gazed into her eyes.\n\n"I allow you to preside over the legal cases scheduled today, and you completely ignore my teachings?!" she spat. As she stomped in anger, a burst of flame erupted from the impact and incinerated the surrounding carpet.\n\n"Their case was—"\n\n"Fabricated," Daybreaker interjected as she conjured a series of pages. She dropped them for Grover to catch. "Witness statements that were provided before today began." Snorting, she added, "And also one criminal history report." Grover remained silent, his throat growing thick with unease. "In fact, notice something familiar?"\n\nHe jogged his memory. Blinking and taking in the griffon's name again, he muttered, "It's the same one from last year. The one—"\n\n"That I eventually agreed to treat leniently, like you kept repeating."

Normally at this time he'd be in study for either politics or war theory, but Daybreaker was preoccupied with some of the griffon nobles who wished to hound her on a trade dispute between [EQS.GetNameDef] and [GRD.GetNameDef]. In her stead, her nephew, Prince Blueblood, had been given charge.\n\nThe prince had been on a military attache to [GRD.GetNameDef], but she had insisted that he take her off her hooves. "Teach him something," had been her exact words.\n\n"Well, what?" Blueblood demanded. With a snort, he crossed his forehooves and looked away from Grover. "Auntie has me playing foalsitter while SHE's off gallivanting somewhere." Blowing a lock of his mane out of his face, he grumbled, "It's a waste of my talents."\n\n"She surely must have thought you could contribute something if she asked you in the first place," interjected Grover. Since Blueblood had been more than unhelpful, he pulled out one of his novels.\n\n"Listen, Auntie might think it is worthwhile keeping you around, but I certainly don't see the point," Blueblood snarled, jabbing a hoof at Grover. "I—" He hummed momentarily. "I suppose I could go over some of the updated war manuals that I was going to speak on with your high command." He scratched his chin.\n\n"How about another idea?" Closing his book, Grover meshed his talons together and peered at Blueblood. He squinted. The light pouring in from the window to his right was a tad blinding. Still, he continued when Blueblood looked at him expectantly. "You have your qualms with Daybreaker, yet you follow her. You must believe in her. Why? What does he stand for that you accept her?"\n\nTaken aback, Blueblood jolted in his seat. He furrowed his brow. As he continued to ponder, he stated thoughtfully, "She's... my aunt. I must help her as best I can." After a second or two, he tapped a hoof on the table and muttered, "She is strong. She endured much in the past few years. She... Equestria is better off with what she has done. There is peace, order, stability. Ponies can sleep at night. Crime is low. Countries respect us."\n\nHe thought briefly.

In fact, there were no visible units on her side, yet she was sneering with a smug, smarmy confidence. As he scratched his chin in thought, she stated, "I'm giving you an opening. My side is, as far as you know, undefended."\n\n"And I am to just believe that?" Grover inquired as he looked at his miniatures. One group was set up in an artillery battery near the back of the front, whereas others were spread out across the simulated battlefield. Ahead of his soldiers, a large town was erected, the side which Daybreaker held, and appeared defenseless.\n\nHe narrowed his eyes.\n\n"You have stalled too long," Daybreaker barked, her magic flaring briefly. Suddenly, the board was alight with a brilliant, if harmless, explosion, as there was a puff of smoke and a number of his soldiers nearest the town were scattered in all directions. As the magical smoke cleared, some cannons near the back of Daybreaker's front appeared.\n\nGrover squawked in frustration. Clenching his beak, he snapped, "This is not how the game is supposed to—"\n\n"While the commander of the griffon army is having a tantrum about the fairness of war," Daybreaker began with a yawn, "the opposing commander moves her first company to engage, while his troops are confused from the barrage." She flashed her magic again. A chorus of pops and gunshots came from some of the buildings in the town, and more of the miniatures fell, as if wounded.\n\nGrinding his beak together, Grover's cheeks grew red and he puffed out his cheeks. Already he had almost lost all of his first company, and only part of the enemy army had revealed itself. He looked back up at Daybreaker, who was sneering. Although nothing was said, she could imagine her taunting him to make a move. What had she always been encouraging him to do? Think pragmatically?\n\n"Fine," he huffed. "I order a full assault."\n\nDaybreaker blinked. "You do not—"\n\n"I know that my forces outnumber the enemy's by approximately three to one. This is a desperate defense. Third and fourth companies will flank the enemy artillery, and destroy any houses that protect defenders. The rest will charge the revealed positions. Losses will be high. But. I. Will. Win." He growled, flaring his wings. "Is that sufficient? Is that what you were wanting me to do?!"\n\nBriefly, Daybreaker was silent. Then, she smiled. About eighty percent of his forces disappeared, but she stated, "Congratulations, griff. You have learned your lesson.""

  solarreworked.129.t:0 "A Kaiser's Justice"
  solarreworked.129.d:0 "Fanning himself with one of his wings, Grover did what he could to keep himself awake as he sat, once again, on his family's throne. This wasn't the first time that he had been allowed to preside over court, to discuss laws, to adjudicate justice, although this time, Daybreaker was hanging in the background as a sinister presence. More than a few of the nobles had murmured regarding it. From what he read of their faces, with either nervous twitching of the eye, furtive glances, or anxious tics such as incessant drumming of claws on nobles' box railing, they were not happy she was there with him.\n\nAt least, that was the light version. Even with the years of serving as his regent, some noblegriffs openly resented the idea of a pony leading them. So far, Daybreaker hadn't ordered them to be relieved of duty, although it was always a pestering thought in his mind.\n\nAlthough he couldn't see Daybreaker, he knew she was watching him, and did what he could to keep himself awake. At first, he would have been excited to apply the law on a criminal griff, like the one before him. Currently, the older hen was arguing that she was framed. She had been living cleanly and hadn't robbed anything from the Imperial Stockpiles in months. However, she hadn't any concrete details to prove it. Yes, a couple of witnesses had corroborated she was living within the law, but she was also seen near one of the stockpiles in Romau, and there was no other evidence to clear her.\n\nWith a dry throat, he held up a claw for her stop, and she obeyed. Still, she did stammer out, "B-But, my liege, I-I'm innocent. You must—"\n\n"Please, stop," Grover interjected as he briefly glanced round his shoulder at Daybreaker, who was merely looking at him icily. There was absolutely zero indication on her deadpan expression what she was thinking. Yet the last few times he had acted on his gut flashed back, along with the repeated lessons.\n\nHe closed his eyes. His stomach churning, he finally opened them and gazed her. "You have a repeat record. You've not been out of jail for more than half a year at a time." Each fact he presented started to make her wilt, which matched slowly hardening feeling in his chest. When she remained silent, he clenched a talon, and declared, "And, because you clearly will repeat this again, I must enact appropriate punishment."\n\nDarting his attention back to Daybreaker, he proclaimed, "And that is why you will be executed by firing squad, as a warning to other would-be thieves of Imperial property!"\n\nAs the griff pleaded with him to rescind, he saw Daybreaker nod. He could only scowl as they dragged the criminal out."

  solarreworked.130.t:0 "Rumination"
  solarreworked.130.d:0 "For once, he was without the constant watching of his regent. For once, he was free.\n\nThese were the only thoughts that ran through Grover's head as he paced down one of the hallways in the Kaiserschloss. While without either one of Daybreaker's representatives of the pony herself, he was unable to leave the palace, he at least didn't have to worry about any lessons. A relief, to be sure.\n\nHe paused to look at his reflection in one of the immaculate windows that overlooked the moat that surrounded the castle. He was frowning. When did he start that? He couldn't recall. It didn't matter, though. At least he could have a taste of the independence he'd have shortly, once he was finally crowned Kaiser, and then he wouldn't have to worry about being lectured to by Daybreaker.\n\nThen [GRD.GetNameDef] would be free of her, and he could—\n\nHe could what? Both nations were inexorably tied to each other, and, admittedly, she had steered him to what seemed to be right paths more often than not. Was severing ties the best option, especially when [EQC.GetNameDef] was a clawhold on the continent?\n\n"You appear pensive, griff," he heard Daybreaker say from behind him, and he jumped and instinctively straightened. With a defiant stare, he met her gaze as she waltzed calmly up to him. She must have been on her own stroll. Or was she following him? As if she read his mind, she sneered and stated, "I am your regent. I always am informed when you slip away."\n\n"Then I suppose I should have tried harder, shouldn't I?" he rhetorically inquired before he adjusted his glasses. "Can't I not have a few minutes' peace?"\n\nDaybreaker chortled. In a flash of magic, she summoned his forefathers' crown and levitated it in front of him. "Do you believe that you will be left alone once you are Emperor?" She moved it away from him and inspected it, as if bored. Deep within him, his blood boiled that she so casually snatched it from its protective case.\n\nSmirking, she added, "I can tell this ruffled some feathers." She continued inspecting before stating, "You know, I remember meeting Grover. The first Grover." She peered at him. "You aren't dissimilar, in fact, I would surmise he'd congratulate me on a job well done."\n\nGrover closed his eyes for a second. Counting to five, he exhaled and the itching sense of curiosity that started plaguing him persisted. Finally, he approached her, and she teleported the crown away. He stuttered once, then asked, "C-Could you tell me about him?""
  solarreworked.130.a:0 "Gladly."
  solarreworked.131.t:0 "Imperial Snapshot"
  solarreworked.131.d:0 "He had been here before. In fact, if Grover's memory served him right, it was exactly one year ago on the dot that he had last been in this position. Additionally, the weather was the exact same. Brilliant, blinding sunlight poured through unabated by the crystal windows of the Kaiserschloss's throne room's windows. In front of where he sat, the same, nervous griffon was fiddling with the camera which would snap the next image of his griffons' kaiser.\n\nLikewise, two pony soldiers stood at attention, clearly doing their best to hide that they were quivering while Daybreaker was in their presence. However, unlike the previous time, Grover didn't bother inspecting them beyond that. They did their job. He did his.\n\nOutside the Kaiserschloss, past the bridges and the river, the city of Griffenheim seemed to teem with activity, not even aware of the events going on inside. Soon, they'd be his responsibility, but that time had not come yet. At this point, they were still ruled by a pony, and he knew, from the rulings he had had to recommend to her himself, they were still not pleased by that.\n\nBut they would follow. It was in their nature to obey the kaisers, and with the skills he had been acquiring, they would rejoice at what he could do for them.\n\n"Do you have no sense in keeping yourself tidy?" Daybreaker huffed, breaking him from his thoughts. She tugged and tightened one of the buttons on his uniform, and rearranged slightly the medals pinned on his chest. She wore a blazing orange dress, and her mane was pushed back in a flowing—if he could describe a living mane as flowing—ponytail. She tsked and fixed one of his hackles.\n\nAs she polished his glasses after taking them off without asking, he snorted, "You could have noticed the grime sooner."\n\n"I am not a mother hen," Daybreaker shot back with a grunt. "Your own servants should be able to do this for you." She paused. "Yet, I suppose it is best that the regent ensures you look the part."\n\nHe smirked. "You do care, don't you?"\n\n"Nonsense!" Daybreaker grimaced and jerked her head away. "I am merely ensuring you look imposing for your subjects." However, she had stuttered, ever so slightly as she responded.\n\n"Smile for the camera, Daybreaker," he quipped as the griffon with the camera nervously glanced between the two of them.\n\nWhen the griffon shrugged and motioned for them to both move a bit closer, Daybreaker shot Grover a side-eyed glance. There was a faint spark in her eye. "Hmph, I suppose I shall, Grover.""
  solarreworked.132.t:0 "Graduation"
  solarreworked.132.d:0 "Curiosity tickling him, Grover inched the door to his chambers open as the words of one of his servants echoed through his head. Something had come for him from [EQS.GetNameDef], something bulky, and something made specially for him. While he would have normally waited, when it was informed that it was sealed with Daybreaker's hoof seal itself, his heart had skipped a beat.\n\nStill the hectic day of the court zipped through his mind. Since coronation, the minutia of running an empire had slowly sucked up more of his time than ever. With the continent mostly stabilized, at least the threat of war toppling that was minimal. Instead, there was the issue of regional differences leading to open conflicts within the government. Yes, [GRD.GetNameDef] was in much better shape when his father passed, but it was still far from perfect.\n\nHowever, his rumination trailed to a stop when he laid eyes upon the towering crate which stood within his room. A majority of the afternoon sunlight was obstructed by the wooden container, since it stood near where he normally read at the end of the day. Next to the box was a crowbar, which also appeared new.\n\nHe frowned. Indeed, the wax seal of Daybreaker, with a gilded emblem of [EQS.GetNameDef] to reflect that she did it herself rested on one of the seals of the box. He bent down, grabbed the crowbar, and broke the seal. Immediately, the door to the crate swung open, as his servants must have unsealed the rest of it.\n\nHe blinked and the crowbar clanked to the ground as he gawked at what was inside. Gleaming in the sunlight, a bronze suit of armor stood, designed much like the knights of Griffonia's. It appeared a perfect fit, eyeing it up.\n\nA single note was attached to it, and he swiped it with a wing. He squawked.\n\n"Grover,\n\nI trust that you will know what to do with this, should war come to the continent again. I have had the best smiths of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] forge each piece, and oversaw the enchantment of the plating myself. If this cannot shrug off medium arms fire, then I will avenge your killers myself.\n\nKnow that I do not write this lightly, young griff. You have exceeded my expectations. Your ancestors would be proud.\n\nSol Invictus,\n\nDaybreaker Sun, Imperatrix Imperium Solaris"\n\nClutching the paper for a second, Grover smirked. "She does care," he finally quipped aloud, then turned to head back to court."

  solarreworked.133.d:0 ""Hey, Bon Bon! You alive?"\n\nPoking her head into the darkened room at the back of her friend's house, Lyra Heartstrings giddily pranced inside, oblivious to the trip wire that she had just triggered. She only caught the barest "whiff" as something zoomed past her head, and she fumbled, looking for one of the blinds to the windows. "Bon Bon!" she called again, her voice barely containing her excitement. "I've got—"\n\n"Quiet!" A hoof was clamped over Lyra's mouth, but Lyra continued to talk, her words completely muffled and garbled by the offender's grip. There was a sigh. "You nearly got your head sliced off, you know that?" Lyra merely shrugged in response. As Lyra lit her horn, another hoof bonked her lightly on the head. "Don't! I'll take you out."\n\nWith a yelp, Lyra was dragged unceremoniously by her tail to somewhere else in the room. After a couple of beeps and boops of numbers being typed into a pad, there was a loud creak and groan of metal. A minute later, Lyra was dumped in a small bunker, with various maps splayed out across a table. A number of weapons and rested against a wall. As soon as she saw a sword, she gasped, "Hey, is that a katana?!" she squeaked, bouncing over to it and snatching it in her magic.\n\nThere was a long sigh. "No, that's just a saber. Lyra, do you even know the first thing about swords?"\n\n"Well, they go 'stab stab!'" proclaimed Lyra as she did just that with the blade. As she whirled around, she froze an inch away from Bon Bon, or, officially, Sweetie Drops. Sweetie didn't even react as she pushed the sword down.\n\n"What is it, Lyra?" She gestured to the table. "I'm busy with work."\n\n"Oh, I won't be long, then!" Lyra chirped. Sheathing the sword, she asked, "Guess what I did?" Beaming from ear to ear at her friend, she barely waited a second before she squeaked, "I'm reporting to the Fifth Artillery Company tomorrow! I can help Equestria!"\n\nLike she had been prodded with an iron, Sweetie jerked up and gawked at Lyra. Blinking, she demanded, "You did what?!" She pinched the bridge of her nose. "Lyra, how? You're not in any shape for combat."\n\n"Well, since I know Princess Twilight, I've been sending her letters like, every other day, asking if she could get me in to help out with the war, and after, like, the fiftieth one or so, she finally said I got a job as artillery commander for the fifth division." Eyes sparkling, Lyra leaned in and squealed, "How exciting is that?"\n\n"Lyra, artillery kills ponies!" With a disgusted sigh, Sweetie grumbled as Lyra's exuberance died and was replaced with horror. As her friend whimpered before fainting, Sweetie huffed, "Think before you act, Lyra.""

  solarreworked.134.t:0 "Newbie on the Block"
  solarreworked.134.d:0 "Struggling and straining, Lyra pushed back against Sweetie Drops as her friend practically threw her forward and out of the train. The two of them had gotten tickets the previous day, after Lyra's revelation, to Sire's Hollow, where the Fifth Artillery Company, the Red Roses, where stationed for the time being. According to Sweetie's knowledge from S.M.I.L.E.—which wasn't classified—it was in the middle of being reorganized after its last commander was shot by a stray bullet by an infiltrator.\n\n"Y-You know, Bon Bon," Lyra stammered as she slowly got to her hooves from where she had staggered from Sweetie's shove, "maybe I was, you know, a bit too hasty! I-I was probably just really annoying to T-Twilight, and she, you know, is just playing a prank!" Sweetie gave her an incredulous stare. After a couple of seconds, Lyra wilted and sighed, "And she doesn't do pranks. Right."\n\n"You signed up for this, now you're going to get a taste of it." She smirked. "Don't worry, Lyra, I have connections." When she saw Lyra's knees practically knocking together, she huffed, "But seriously, what did you think would happen when you kept pestering Princess Twilight?" Clicking her tongue, she trotted off the train and motioned out to the field near the settlement. In it, a large detachment of artillery pieces could be seen, as well as a series of prefabricated buildings. "I'm familiar with a couple of the ponies in the regiment. You'll be fine."\n\n"A-A-And if I have t-to shoot somepony?" Lyra gulped and her uniform, which had been delivered by magic with a note from Twilight wishing Lyra luck and to never contact her again until after the war, was already drenched around her neck. She shot Sweetie a nervous stare and whimpered.\n\n"You'll be in the back, and artillery doesn't really shoot ponies." Sweetie shrugged. "It more turns them into red paste." At that, Lyra froze, then went listless, with Sweetie barely catching her in time. As she propped up Lyra, she snarled, "Don't you DARE go boneless on me, Lyra!" Lyra remained completely inert, and Sweetie huffed as she let go.\n\nLyra grunted at the impact. Still, she remained limp and Sweetie furrowed her brow. Wordlessly, she grabbed Lyra by the end of her tail and tugged, which made Lyra yelp, but still remain like a wet sack. By the time they had gotten close to the base, Sweetie was drenched in sweat and finally gave a last whinny before yanking on Lyra, enough to make her stagger to her hooves for a second.\n\nTaking one look around at the assembling soldiers, Sweetie quipped, "Your new CO, everypony." She stomped away. Lyra merely squeaked and waved. Then fainted again."

  solarreworked.135.d:0 ""And this section of the camp, no matter WHERE it's based, is where our shells are stored," Lieutenant Rangefinder stated as she led Lyra into a yard at the back of the camp of the Red Roses, which was guarded at the only entrance, and contained also a couple of buildings. One was labeled the armory, the other, artillery storage. Lyra gawked at it momentarily, given its size compared to the rest of the buildings in the camp.\n\n"T-That's where they're all stored?" She pointed at the larger building. Swallowing hard, she shuffled and kicked at some of the loose dirt. "T-They won't go off, uh, randomly, will they?" Her brow glistened with a bit of sweat. Taking off her uniform's cap, she let out a small titter and held Rangefinder's bemused stare. At his lack of an answer, she whimpered and flattened her ears against her head. "O-Okay, anything else?"\n\n"The rest of the recruits have already been assigned here. We were merely waiting for you, Captain Heartstrings." Raising both eyebrows, he asked, "You said the Princess recommended you?" At Lyra's uneasy nod, he gave a halfhearted huff and merely quipped, "Okay." Adjusting his uniform, he motioned for Lyra to follow him, and he stated, "Might as well meet the quartermaster. She spends most of her time in here nowadays."\n\n"What happened that required reorganization?" Lyra asked. With a quick whinny, she followed up with, "Well, aside from your last captain getting shot?"\n\n"Damn changeling infiltrators got to her, but also some of our shells exploded while they were being carried to some of the guns. Took out two dozen ponies and injured another sixty or so." Rangefinder shook his head as he opened metal door of the artillery shell storage, to reveal rows upon rows of them in neat aisles. As they entered, Lyra spotted a mare bending down to inspect a shell and called at her.\n\nThe mare jolted and Lyra waved. With an irritating nicker, the mare snapped, "Can't you see I'm busy, lieutenant? These shells won't mark themselves." She snorted and then got up. Lyra spotted a few shells that were left on the ground.\n\n"Polite as always, Flintlock," Rangefinder grunted and gave a short, mocking salute. "Just bringing the new CO around to see everything." All he got was a growl in return. Leaning over to Lyra, he hissed, "She got testier once we saw combat. Probably how she handles the stress of logistics." Lyra merely nodded.\n\nAs they headed to leave after a short tour, Lyra lit her horn and exclaimed, "Hey, I'll put these away for you!" She grabbed the shells and put them on one of the shelves, although not fully. Flintlock yelped and dove toward them as they left, but as the door shut, they were knocked to the ground as there was a deafening explosion.\n\nLyra groaned. While her vision and hearing cleared, she felt debris raining on her, and she felt Rangefinder shaking her. Groggily, she blinked and then a partial piece of black chitin fell on her nose. It was slightly green from changeling blood. Both she and him stared at it, then at the crater that used to be the supply depot.\n\nLyra fainted."

  solarreworked.136.d:0 "It was unnerving, to say the least. Looking into the mare's eyes was like staring into a twisted reflection of herself. Even more perturbing, the absolute serenity that this pony, this heretic, had. Inquisitor Aurora Shinespark shook herself. Regardless of the disquiet that had settled over the chamber since the induction of its captive, she had a job to do.\n\n"You've come back," the pegasus mare stated, craning her head back to try and catch glance of Aurora. Despite the dried blood on her chin and forehead and the burn marks across her face, she seemed at peace.\n\n"Speak when spoken to, heretic," snapped back Aurora. Her horn flared briefly, but the spell she considered preparing fizzled out. There was little point when it didn't seem to accomplish much. When she marched around to be visible from the rack which the mare, Sweet Bliss, was tied to, she frowned. She glowered into Sweet Bliss's eyes. In her chest, a flame of frustration flickered and smoldered.\n\n"Did you come to ask me questions again?" Sweet inquired airily. Smiling sweetly, she giggled and declared, "Maybe you'll want to learn more about the Prophet's words?"\n\n"Your 'Friendship Lodge' is shattered. You've already been defeated," Aurora replied matter-of-factly. Grabbing a single knife from the table near the rack, Aurora momentarily played with it. She floated it in her magic, then eyed Sweet Bliss. "And now, you will tell me where the rest scattered. You heretics—"\n\n"Faithful. Haven't we gone over this?"\n\n"HERETICS! Your other conspirators have already confessed!" Aurora retorted. Stabbing the knife directly into the wood beside Sweet's head, she growled, "Now it is time for you to corroborate them."\n\n"No! You are lying! This is just another test of the Sun Goddess!" Closing her eyes, Sweet Bliss, began to hum a hymn, much like those sung in [ROOT.GetNameDef]. Between stanzas, she crooned, "She is merely testing my faith! She knows—"\n\n"Your 'Sun Goddess' is false! Your vile corruption defiles the God-Empress's image!" Gritting her teeth, Aurora felt her face flush and she took the knife out again. Holding it against Sweet's neck, Aurora fed heat into the blade. As there was a soft sizzle of burning flesh, she snarled, "If you wish for your soul to have ANY chance of redemption, you shall prove your faith in Daybreaker by telling me where the rest of the Friendship Lodge has fled!"\n\nSweet merely tightened her lips. Grunting furiously, Aurora pulled back and sighed. She dropped the knife. Instead, her horn lit in a bright orange, which swallowed the rack. There was a single spark, and Sweet's eyes jerked open, looking down at the fire licking up the wooden rack. Aurora sneered. "Meet your Goddess, heretic.""

The throne room of the Imperial Palace was, despite how everything in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] was bright, worryingly dark. Twin moats of lava slowly descended from a break behind the throne, upon which the alicorn sat. Aside from the orange lighting of the lava, there was little, as magic darkened the windows to allow for a better illumination of the stained glass.\n\nBeside the stallion, Raven Inkwell trotted up and cleared her throat, "Your Majesty, God-Empress of Ponykind, may I introduce Cracked Marble, the forepony of your cathedral project." The mare scribbled something on her clipboard and she whispered to Cracked, "You have five minutes to make your case. The Empress's time is limited."\n\nHe gulped.\n\nAs he looked up at Daybreaker, he shivered as he gazed into her yellow eyes, which seemed to glow in the dim lighting. After making an awkward bow, he held his head low and mumbled, "P-Pardon the interruption, my Empress, I-I know that—"\n\n"Enough groveling," Daybreaker interrupted with a sigh. "Speak and be done with it." She didn't bother to hold her attention on him, instead finding a speck of dirt on her armor more intriguing. She brushed it off.\n\n"Y-Yes, a thousand apologies, my Empress, I-I just—" Cracked swallowed hard. With a small whinny, he spread himself further on the path leading up to the throne and stammered, "T-The Cathedral of the Sun i-is going to be d-delayed. Th-There is—"\n\n"'Delayed?'" Daybreaker echoed, her voice growing cold and even. "Forepony, I do not pay you or your workers to experience 'delays'." Slowly getting to her hooves, she stalked toward Cracked. "Do you know what a delay indicates?" When he squeaked and shook his head, she snarled, "Incompetence. Distraction. Faithlessness!"\n\n"N-No, it's nothing like that! T-There was an incident in the quarries and—"\n\n"And excuses!" Daybreaker growled. Suddenly igniting her horn, she grabbed Cracked and held him up close to her.

Do you wish to see ponies fall away in unbelief?"\n\nCracked merely squealed.\n\n"Shall I have him taken to be corrected, God-Empress?" Raven cut in. Tiredly brushing the quill she used with her clipboard against her forehead, she stated, "You must speak with the Militarium Command soon, and then afterward, it is the sun setting ceremony."

At least, if one wasn't a changeling. As he tore down one of the twisting hoofways of the city, he could hear commotion carrying through the streets as the millions of changelings that resided went about their days.\n\nHe glanced at a small list of items which he held in his sickly green magic. About half of them were scratched off with a pencil, although the remainder had various notes and frustrated scribblings marking information that he had acquired. Even as he walked, he could feel the tension that was within the city.\n\nSince the war with the ponies began, [CHN.GetLeader] had promised that the nation would finally avenge the humiliation of 1002, but those days had yet to come. That the unease and frustration was so palpable wasn't a surprise, but the sheer volume of it he could taste from his fellow changelings was. In his mind's eye, he still heard the shouts and jeers outside the queen's palace as changelings gathered to voice their anger at the length of the war.\n\nHe bared his teeth. With frustration, he checked the nearest street sign indicator, the changeling magic of which glowed in the evening light, and frowned. Although this was the place that he was told to go, it didn't look like somewhere that provided simple bandages and other medical mishmash. The literal whole in the wall structure was caked in grime, and the lights didn't appear to be on.\n\nHowever, it was where he was told to go by one of his usual aids when it came to emergency medical supplies. By this point, even basic bandages were a luxury. Everything was being held for the Wehrmacht.\n\nChecking his sight lines again, he swallowed deeply and inched toward the building before he froze. Normally, at night, it was a tad chilly in the air, given how north the city was, but his wings had begun to involuntarily start fanning himself. Every heartbeat came quicker, and his blood pressure spiked. In the distance, he heard a few voices scream and one distinctly exclaim, "The sky! It's on fire!"\n\nAs he ducked into a shady portion of an overhang of the building, he felt his chitin excreting moisture in an effort to cool him further. By now, he could see defined shadows from the buildings, and an orange glow intensified by the second. Squinting, he glanced up, and his heart sank.\n\nA brilliant pillar of fire raced down from the sky. Every breath, the air warmed. By now it was almost like breathing the air of the Badlands in the summer. For a brief second, his brain shut down, then he gulped and stepped out into the street.

By now, her uniform had been dirtied and made completely offensive to the eyes, but she ignored it. Every second that she spent stuck in prison was one more that Daybreaker could have been doing Luna knows what to [BAT.GetNameDef]'s ponies.\n\nAs if thinking of the fiery devil summoned her, Daybreaker appeared in a burst of flame, directly in front of Velvet. Instinctively, Velvet shrieked and scrambled back further into the cell. Her eyes went wide momentarily, and she brought a hoof toward her chest to shield it. But she was not instantly fried; in fact, Daybreaker smirked.\n\nDaybreaker leaned down, practically stalking toward Velvet. Her grin gave way to a throaty chuckle. "My, my," she began with a click of her tongue, "is that any way to greet your empress?" She shook her head. "Disappointing, and I thought that you'd be more amenable than the last three I've spoken with. All I want is some information."\n\nVelvet's ears perked up, but she still glared at Daybreaker. When Daybreaker noticed the slight change, she stood straight. "Yes, information. A quid pro quo, of sorts." In her magic, she summoned a small scrying portal. In it, a single pegasus stallion was currently in a cell of his own. Velvet gasped, but remained silent. "Familiar?" Daybreaker asked.\n\nAs soon as it was there, the portal vanished, and Daybreaker leered down at Velvet, practically to the point where their noses touched. With Daybreaker's face inches from hers, Velvet could only gaze into the pits of hellfire that were Daybreaker's eyes. They practically glowed as Daybreaker stated nonchalantly, "If you cooperate, you can see him again, and anypony else whom you know." She grinned. "I'm no monster, I only wish to see true criminals brought to justice."\n\n"Y-You're a monster who wishes to kill us all!" Velvet stammered, her muzzle contorting into a scowl. "You banished or murdered Luna and—"\n\n"'Luna?!'" interjected Daybreaker with a scoff. Forcing back a couple of giggles, she wiped a tear from her eye. Her mane's glow softened and went a slight shade darker while she stated, "She made her own choices, and now she's facing their consequences." She squished one of Velvet's cheeks, inspecting her. "Just like your compatriots will suffer theirs. But you may not."\n\nWhile Velvet eyed her, she inquired, "Tell me, is it a kindness to let fanatics slaughter hundreds of thousands, simply because you thought protecting them saved lives?" At that, Velvet's stomach felt like she'd been bucked with both hindlegs by a stallion. She swallowed. Daybreaker sneered. "Or, shall you save a few you know, and rescue millions in the process? I don't think it'd be hard, would it?""

  solarreworked.140.d:0 ""Heya, Short Stop, how's the cannon looking? Great? Great!" Lyra chortled as she spun around and trotted back to another of the artillery placements that had been dug since her Firth Artillery Company had been ordered to the front lines. Everything there was so different from central Equestria. No more green grass to nibble on between meals, for one. Had to eat rations, and only at prescribed meal times. Talk about gross!\n\nWith a wink and click of her tongue, after she had waltzed over to the next gun in the emplacement, she prodded, "Yo, Curvature, ready to lob the next big one at those guys?" She pointed randomly, not even to where the front was. Frankly, that detail rarely concerned her. Usually Rangefinder or another lieutenant handled that. In fact, the less things she knew about what was going on, the better.\n\nAfter passing out from seeing somepony with a nosebleed after a small training incident, she had agreed to recuse herself of most of her duties. Of course, she was still giving Princess Twilight daily updates, just as a thanks for all the work that she had done to get Lyra a placement in the military. Any letters that came back seemed like incorrect addressees. Repeating "stop" a hundred times couldn't have been meant for her, right?\n\nShaking her head, she didn't wait for a response from Curvature, especially since he was just rocking back and forth at the moment. She shrugged. Soon, she heard a whistle high in the sky, and she started to go along with it. Seconds later, it stopped, replaced with a deafening explosion that showered her in dirt. She just shrugged it off.\n\nCantering further back behind the emplacements, she sighed as she saw the limp form of the operator. Missing a bit of his head, but it could be fixed, probably. As she pushed him to the side, she caught some squawking on the radio, and brought up the headphones connected to the unit. She nodded, wordlessly, and wrote down some coordinates. She then looked at them.\n\nWas it oh-five-eight or oh-eight-five that had been said for enemy location? She huffed. Second guessing herself was pointless. Oh-five-eight it was!\n\nRelaying that information to the guns, and to the pony who called it in, she heard some panicked shouts from the radio before the artillery unleashed its first volley. Between bursts, the radio was silent, then, when the artillery finally died, a thin voice on the radio muttered, "Thanks for assist. Must have been precognition. A whole company, right at that, uh, totally correct location."\n\nLyra whinnied and signed off. Then she glanced down at a half-scribbled note from the slain operator. Blushing profusely, she snatched it and slipped off. On the paper had been the coordinates of the strike. Oh-eight-five."

  solarreworked.141.d:0 ""So, you see, Princess, if were to allocate some of the war funding to—"\n\nCelestia closed her eyes and tuned out one of the prattling, moronic aristocrats of the court. As soon as the thought entered her head about questioning his intelligence, she winced, but still paid zero attention to his rambling. Her head was aching, anyway. How long had it been since she had taken a nap?\n\nWhen the thought of sleep crossed her mind, she shook her head. In response, the droning of the aristocrat stopped. After a second or so, Celestia opened her eyes and noticed he was staring at her. Forcing a smile, she asked, "Sorry, what was that again?"\n\nHe scrunched his muzzle. "As I was SAYING, Princess, if some of the war funding could be diverted to this year's Grand Galloping Gala, we could distract ponies with the—"\n\nCelestia snapped. One of her eyelids twitching slightly, she asked, "What. Was. That?"\n\nAlmost instantly, the stallion stuttered and took a step or two back. Glancing around at his fellow court members, he fumbled over his words and finally mewled, "I-I-I was only t-thinking that—"\n\n"You were not thinking, at ALL!" Celestia slammed a hoof on her throne's dais. As all eyes turned to her, she marched down the dais toward the aristocrat, her face practically on fire from how hot she felt. Her mane slowly simmered, smoldering with a fury that had gripped her heart.\n\nThis stallion DARED to suggest that anything less than full commitment to the war and her ponies' protection was acceptable?! She snarled as she got to him and looked down.\n\nAs she stared into his eyes, she saw herself reflected back in them. Her face was contorted into a snarl, and... were those fangs and... was her mane on fire? She blinked. Staring at her reflection again, she no longer spotted those details. Only her normal, angry face.\n\nHeaving a couple of times, she felt her head begin to throb further, and she stepped back. She rested a hoof against her head. Inwardly she could envisions Luna shouting at her to calm down, to take a break. But Luna was at the front. She was nowhere near Canterlot.\n\nShakily, she declared, "Court is dismissed. I-I apologize for my outburst, Twist Top. It was not proper of me."\n\nTwist Top merely whimpered and scampered off with the rest of the court. When she was alone, Celestia fell back on her haunches, and gazed at her reflection in the marble floor.\n\nHer lonely specter stared back."

  solarreworked.142.t:0 "Home of the Sun"
  solarreworked.142.d:0 "Breathing in deeply, Daybreaker smirked as she listened to the din of ponies from across the Empire fill the open square. Brilliant sunlight poured directly from on high, beating down on the populace with unfettered warmth and love. She, herself, basked in its comforting embrace, and she let out a small, contented sigh.\n\nThe tension, the excitement, the anticipation, was palpable as she stood, patiently, on the podium. Behind her, only the grand doors of the new Cathedral of the Sun were visible. So towering were the arches that comprised the entrance, that the grand structure had to be gawked at from hundreds of feet away. Even now, she could see the whiteness of the marble reflecting the golden rays of sunlight onto the wood of the temporary dais.\n\nIn her periphery, the gilded wings of the cathedral, which stretched out from its side like her own feathered appendages, glittered and shone, painting striking shapes upon the citizens gathered around her.\n\nDrinking in the adoration, she bared her teeth and gave a single bow toward them all. Cheers rose from the crowd. Glancing behind her, she gazed up, straight to the very tallest spire, which practically touched the heavens itself. The spiraling rooftops, adorned with the finest golden shingles, blazed like the sun itself. From far and wide, everypony would be able to see the glorious edifice of her might, her power, and her affluence.\n\nAs she traced her eyes down the sides of the building, she lingered briefly on the mosaics and engravings of herself, of the sun, and of the greatest feats of the Empire. Banishing Nightmare Moon, destroying Tirek, crushing the changeling invasion of 1002. Yet more decorated the exterior, which made her heart skip in excitement. While not having seen the inside, to savor the unknown, she know that it had to be as beautiful as its exterior.\n\nOf course it had to be. It was for her, after all.\n\nShe focused again on her citizens. Her ponies. Her adorers.\n\nTrailing her gaze along each of them that were closest to the podium, she closed her eyes and effectively absorbed their love. Everything had been poured into this. Much had been sacrificed.\n\nAll of it would pay off.\n\nStepping forward so that she was more visible, Daybreaker briefly spun to take in the entire square, packed to the brim with her ponies, and she cackled. She opened her mouth. The cathedral was officially open for worship."

  solarreworked.143.d:0 "It should have been routine. Why wasn't it routine?\n\nInquisitor Aurora Shinespark gritted her teeth as she paced back and forth outside the interrogation chamber that had been set up in Ayacachtli. Perhaps it was missing the daylight while sequestered away in the damned cubbyhole that was the largest thestral city. Maybe it was because she was stuck dealing with idiotic bats, no better than the dirt that soiled her hooves. Possibly it was that she had been bested by—\n\nNo.\n\nShe shook her head. No thestral could possibly withstand one of the God-Empress's chosen inquisitors. She had not gone through years of Tartarus to be resisted by a single bat!\n\nSnarling, she whirled back into the interrogation chamber, which was currently lit with as many candles, torches, and other sources of light that it could squeeze in. At least it'd be something to provide solace to the faithful, while tormenting the darkness inside every spawn of Nightmare Moon that they dragged in before their cleansing.\n\nIn pre-empted frustration, Aurora lit her horn with a fire spell and growled, "We'll go over this one more time, daemon-spawn: where are the others? That group you were with. They have vanished. You'll tell me, unless you wish for your soul to perish along with your body."\n\nThe thestral on the torture table remained mute. Although battered, bruised, and burned, her golden eyes smoldered with defiance. Through split, puffy lips, she managed to spit at Aurora. The saliva splattered against Aurora's front shoes. In silence, the bat returned to staring past Aurora at the wall of blinding lights.\n\nFinally, though, she croaked something. "You know you serve a lie, right?" She coughed once. A few dribbles of blood bubbled up from her throat. They trickled down her neck.\n\nFurrowing her brow, Aurora hissed as she conjured her magic into a blade of pure fire. "Heresy! The God-Empress is nothing but truth! She cannot deceive!"\n\nThe thestral, identified as Crescent Glow by records, chuckled, which soon sounded crackly as she hacked up more blood. "You so sure about that?" she queried. Aurora flattened her ears against her head.\n\nDrawing the blade back and readying it for a thrust, Aurora growled, her eyes merely pinpricks of pure rage, "Their location, now, or suffer my God-Empress's righteous punishment!" She thrust the blade within millimeters of Crescent's muzzle.\n\nThen, she slowly, agonizingly, traced it down the thestral's chest.\n\nDespite the stench of boiling pony flesh, Crescent remained steadfast. When Aurora reached her stomach, all she grunted was, "Make me.""

  solarreworked.144.d:0 "Crescent Glow sighed.\n\nHad she let herself go? She glanced at her reflection in the mirror. Taking up arms against Daybreaker, that had been tempting at one point, before it was clear that all of her influences would continue to creep south no matter how much it was fought. Of course, with no resistance, and the Night Guard disbanded, where did that leave her?\n\nAlone. At home. Growing fat and useless.\n\nShe winced and corrected herself. She wasn't fat. Not yet, anyway.\n\nOf course, there had been waiting. There had been anticipation. When was the order finally going to come to arrest them all? The rhetoric was all there. Ponies had been whipped into frenzies over less in the past over thestrals. Yet... it never quite came.\n\nWas it a great time? No... not really. Was it better when Celestia had been in charge instead of that monster? Yes. But, the oppression wasn't quite there. They were shunned, but not outright rejected. They were given chances, even if it was more difficult.\n\nWas that something she could live with? Could she affect that if she struggled for it?\n\nAfter inspecting herself again in her mirror, she ruffled her wings and grabbed her glasses. There was a hairline crack in one of the lenses. Wasn't really a point of getting it fixed, especially with how it was more arduous to get enough bits together for a new lens or pair in the South-East. Maybe that'd soon change, though.\n\nWith another shiver, she eyed her dress uniform, the brilliant blue and silver hues dancing in the small shafts of sunlight descending upon it. Visually sizing it up, then feeling her chest, she nickered. She snatched the uniform, then slipped it on, only once sucking in a breath to squeeze into it.\n\nWhen she had finished, she brushed off some of the dust and dirt that lingered in the air, and she furrowed her brow.\n\nA call had gone out. It seemed that Daybreaker was either desperate, or she was truly living up to pseudo-equality between ponies. In the back of her head, she briefly envisioned the hope that Luna had promised. Freedom for all. Redemption for even the most despised.\n\nThat was all far away, now.\n\nShe swallowed, pushed the butterflies in her gut down, and strode out of her house. In a solemn march, she pressed toward the recently established Ayacachtli garrison. When she reached its gate, she glared down the one guard in the guardhouse and declared, "General Crescent Glow of the Lunar Guard reporting for duty.""

  solarreworked.145.d:0 "She shouldn't be surprised.\n\nIn fact, she wasn't.\n\nCrescent Glow asked herself why she even remotely shocked about the turn of events. After all, the Solarists were clear from the start that they despised her and every single other thestral in the South-East. It started with just a few exclusions, then moved to complete discrimination, followed at last by arrests for the slightest thing. They were blamed for every misstep that happened in the last century, if not more.\n\nSo, really, what was so unexpected about that?\n\nAs all these thoughts and more played through her head, she simply stared at the barrel of the gun that was pointed at her. After a couple of seconds, she tilted her head slightly to look at the young earth pony behind it, and she arched a brow. Was he going to shoot?\n\nShe'd heard the rumors. Mass arrests. Some thestrals had been burned as mobs took over the organized military operations and soon turned them into witch hunts. Even so much as coughing wrong would have been grounds for being locked away, or shot, for something "anti-Harmonic."\n\nYet, when she gazed into the eyes of the stallion on the other side of the gun, she could only sense fear and revulsion in him. Although he was standing still, she caught the faint quiver of fear and hesitation in his grip on the rifle.\n\n"First time, kid?" she finally asked, which made him almost fumble his gun. With a sigh, she flattened her ears against her head. She briefly checked her shoulders. Her wings were still tied. As were all those who were standing beside her.\n\n"Don't listen to the prisoners. Fall in line with the others and wait for my order," another voice grunted from behind the soldier. Crescent merely gave a tired glare past him. Looked like the executioner had finally arrived. Or woken up. Did it matter?\n\nThe soldier swallowed and stepped back, moving into a single line with a dozen other troopers. Each of them were straight-faced and, their eyes burning with barely restrained enmity. What she had done to any of them, bar existing, was anypony's guess. Probably nothing.\n\nClosing her eyes, she briefly whimpered an apology to Luna. The hope of thestral redemption had truly died.\n\n"For crimes against Harmony, I pronounce you all guilty and worthy of death," the officer in charge declared. "Take aim!" Crescent sighed as he began the series of instructions to his troops.\n\nBriefly opening her eyes to look at the young stallion who was her death-bringer, she stared at him, hard, and thought to herself, 'You'll have to live with this, fool.'\n\nShe didn't hear the command to fire, as her world was engulfed in flame, then smothered in darkness."

  solarreworked.146.d:0 ""Empress, there is a pony who is insisting to have an audience with you." With a snort, Daybreaker turned to face the guard who had addressed her and was poking his head through the door of the throne room. Raven Inkwell shot her a bemused look from the side, and the small number of aristocrats that were currently discussing the terribly important topic of the state of some of the roads in the capital. After all, how dare the crews not keep them in tip top shape twenty-four-seven?\n\n"Is there now?" she inquired. Humming softly, she waved a hoof. "Very well. Raven, show these... fine ponies out and I will hear the plea of my poor subject." Although she refrained from grinning, she couldn't help but scoff under her breath. Bold of whomever wished to see her. Definitely curious.\n\nOnce Raven had departed with the aristocrats, the guards escorted in a red-furred mare with a crimson mane. She waltzed with an air of authority, and Daybreaker narrowed her eyes. She bowed, and the soldiers departed. After a few seconds, Daybreaker inquired, "Tell me, Argynnis, why have you dared to come here alone, and, more importantly, disguised?"\n\nBlinking in surprise, the mare let out a small stutter before Daybreaker nodded at her. The mare wrinkled her nose, and in a bright flash of green fire, transformed back into Vrak's queen. She grunted. "How could you tell so easily?"\n\n"For a creature that's a master of disguise, you're woefully unoriginal," crooned Daybreaker, who lounged back into her throne. Arching a brow, she added, "Seriously? Red and red? The swagger? Could you be more obvious?"\n\n"Oh, and I suppose you would have thought of something more impressive on short notice?" Argynnis snapped back before she flinched and bowed again.\n\n"Did you desire to see how quickly I would cook you from the inside out, bug, or is there a point to this?" Briefly feeling her chest simmer in frustration, Daybreaker kept herself calm, although her mane began to turn a brighter yellow, approaching white.\n\nStill facing the floor, Argynnis stammered a couple of times before she finally spat, "I've come... to ask for Vrak's...." Swallowing, she choked on her words. "It's autonomy. In return—" She coughed "—in return, I promise to serve you. We cannot fight you militarily, but we can help you in exchange for... survival."\n\n"You seek to survive, like a cockroach," Daybreaker mused coyly. She steepled her hooves.\n\nGrimacing at Daybreaker's quip, Argynnis momentarily bared her teeth, then declared with a begrudging tone, "I will... lead your armies, follow your orders without question." Pain spread across her face. "Just let me promise my changelings a future.""

As the calm, wispy clouds drifted aimlessly in the morning sunlight, a series of warning sirens began to pierce through the idyllic silence, startling a few birds from their nests in solitary trees, or frightening tiny animals from their slumbers. In short order, a buzz of activity heightened around a base camp that had been nestled near to a small wood.\n\nFurther creatures of the forest complained and retreated from the blaring cry of the alarms in the camp. Ponies darted to and fro, rapidly checking in tents, the prefabricated command center, and with each other. Runes had been scrawled onto the ground, great, sprawling letters of arcane words lost to most through time. Around two dozen unicorns had gathered around some of the central runes, chanting various incantations while their horns glowed brilliantly.\n\nFrom the command center, Daybreaker stood, observing the hustle and bustle of her lead scientists' teams. Bunsen Beaker was ordering ponies to which stations they should man, while Pinpoint was writing a final few thoughts and equations down on a large chalkboard. The alert continued to wail, and Daybreaker could almost sense the crackle of magical energy in the air outside.\n\nWhen Bunsen finally stopped haranguing his underlings and neared Daybreaker, she inquired, "We are prepared?"\n\n"Yes, yes." He huffed and waved a hoof dismissively. "We are ready." Looking over to Pinpoint's blackboard, he snapped, "You have confirmed the magic is correct?"\n\nIn response, Pinpoint frowned and nodded before she marched toward them both. Rubbing his hooves together, Bunsen reached for a microphone near Daybreaker and exclaimed, "Commence Project Helios!" He suppressed a chuckle. "You may fire when ready!"\n\nAs the microphone squeaked into silence, Daybreaker turned to look out the post's one window. In her wake, every eye turned from their work to watch. The unicorns, [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s finest, strained, their magic sparking and sputtering. In the distance, near the horizon, the sky itself seemed to warp and distort, and Daybreaker's grin grew greater.\n\nGently caressing the sun, Daybreaker nudged it upward, a smidgen further. As she did, the command center went silent. One second. Two seconds. Three. Soon, a brilliant pillar of fire shot from the heavens, down to the earth. Great jets of flame leapt from where it hit, and zoomed from its impact.\n\nAt that, cheers erupted as the beam died. Daybreaker could only giggle. Some nations might have had nuclear weapons, but what were they, when the sun itself could ensure her enemies extinction?"

The fighting for Griffinheim had ceased, although she could still hear occasional pockets of conflict spring up in other parts of [GRD.GetNameDef]'s capital. However, that concerned her not one bit. There had been a familiar aspect to the [GRD.GetAdjective] commander's tactics, but it was under a layer of adaptation, of learning.\n\nOf course, now that she had encountered him, Grover II, it explained much. In her mind, she danced over the words she'd speak. After all, she hadn't seen him in about two hundred years. Although, she looked quite different then, too. Finally, she settled on a chuckle and stated, "My, my, Grover, you look horrible! Did they drag you from a ditch?"\n\nThe griffon, clad in enchanted armor bearing the strongest wards known to griffonkind, shifted his stance slightly. His sole fleshy eye crackled with energy, while the empty eye socket of his exposed skull stared back at her hauntingly. "You speak like you know me, pony, yet you are unfamiliar." In his grip, he held a heavy broadsword, which glinted in Daybreaker's sun. "Your arrogance will be your downfall."\n\nDaybreaker scoffed. "Please. Your hubris led to you getting a javelin through the eye." At Grover's slightly tightened frown, she bared her teeth. "It appears that you have lost again." She didn't get any further, as Grover screeched like a hawk and sprang at her, using his wings to hurl himself with speed improbable in his armor. With a smirk, Daybreaker rolled to the side, and the sword clanged heavily on the ground.\n\nGrover immediately whirled, slicing where she was with impeccable accuracy. She brayed. Springing up, she nickered when her shoes clinked off the blade. Before she could fully recover, he lunged at her again, and she met his sword with the armored edges of her wings. As they connected, sparks sprayed from the different enchantments interacting and briefly she was pushed further back, toward the pavement.\n\nBetraying panic, Daybreaker's mane began to writhe frantically. Grover's expression tightened. She could almost feel the bones of her wings snapping. As she only a few inches off the ground, her snarl turned into a sneer, and she cackled. Suddenly kicking up with a hindleg, she connected with some of the softer underbelly of his armor. He grunted and staggered.\n\nIt was enough. With her opening, she used her magic to bounce up and knee him again. And again. Winded, he staggered to his knees, his sword loose in his grip. Daybreaker merely sneered and snatched it, then held it to his neck.\n\n"You can't kill me. Yale has... cursed me," he finally coughed.\n\nClicking her tongue, Daybreaker merely tossed the sword aside. "Kill you? No, why would I do that? You can live to what happens to your empire. Oh, I mean my empire.""

Coloratura, dressed in one of her more dazzling sequin dresses and with a single lock of her mane dyed her old persona's shades of purple to stand out against her natural color nibbled on the inside of a cheek.\n\nAs she briefly peeked out from behind the curtain of the stage which her faithful crew members had torn down and erected numerous times—a wonder of recent earth pony advancements—she swallowed hard as she gazed out on the sea of ponies. Normally, she the fear of crowds didn't grip her. After so many years of performing, the nerves of rows of eyes gawking at her had dulled, but these ponies were no ordinary fans.\n\nThey were soldiers.\n\nTaking a deep breath and stepping back behind the curtain, she brushed herself down, checked her attire, and mouthed a few words of silent prayer to whatever deity would deign her with luck. Already, she could envision one of her assistants on the road, one whom she always chose at random, walking out onto the stage to build up the excitement for her appearance.\n\nAs she did, the roar of the soldiers who had been able to attend this special show exploded, growing to a cacophony that drowned out the assistant's amplified voice. When it finally died down again, Coloratura slipped on a hat hoofed to her, and she practiced a smile or two. Her ears twitched when she heard her name proclaimed, the Countess Coloratura, and she exhaled.\n\nStepping out, she was immediately cheered when the spotlights landed on her, and she hesitated, if only for a second. Regaining her composure, she confidently sauntered out and bowed. She nodded to her pianist, and removed her hat, placing it on the instrument's lid. After looking back out over the crowd, her heart twisted.\n\nOne pony she spotted was missing a leg. Another, gauze still wrapped most of her body and head. Yet another was bound to a wheelchair, while a fourth had lost both ears. Each one had come to see her. Be moved by her.\n\nAll she could do was gulp.\n\nWhen she was hoofed a microphone, she simply declared, "Thank you, everypony. I'm honored to be here." She bit her lip. "Usually I can talk up a storm, but tonight, I think that the music should be the one talking." She motioned to the pianist. "Let's start with something familiar.

When Sunrise rose, she spotted Dawnbreak next to Daybreaker, and she arched an eyebrow. Dawnbreak merely shot her a confident grin. With the wordless exchange, Daybreaker stepped forward and barked, "Sunrise."\n\nSunrise switched her attention to Daybreaker. Anticipation plastered her features.\n\n"What are you doing here, Sunrise?" inquired Daybreaker. Sunrise blinked.\n\nScrunching her muzzle, Sunrise frowned and quipped, "You know what I'm doing here, Empress. I-I'm in my lab." She gestured to her equipment. "Can't expect science and Harmony to progress without breaking a few eggs!" She beamed, then tittered, "Although, could I have a few more prisoners, for, uh, reasons?"\n\nDaybreaker grimaced and then paced the lab. As she draped a hoof across one of the dusty tables set up holding equipment, she huffed, "Not your activity, Sunrise. What are you doing HERE? Remember my truths. What are you doing here, not aiding Harmony and Order's survival?"\n\n"But, I am!" Sunrise stomped once on the floor. "If I don't perform my experiments, how are we going to get the best extraction techniques, and if—"\n\n"If I may," Dawnbreak broke in, trotting toward Sunrise with a small amount of swagger, "what the Empress is asking is only what has been asked of us all."\n\n"I'm still best suited if I—"\n\n"Oh, sorry, did she give an option to say 'no?' We're her prized proteges, and you want to sit back and poke dead frogs all day?" From where she stood, Daybreaker watched the exchange take place, emotionless.

Imagine the creatures you could take for your experiments then."\n\nBiting her lip, Sunrise switched her gaze between Daybreaker, Dawnbreak, and her lab tables.

  solarreworked.409.d:0 "Breathing in as waves of heat rolled upon her, Daybreaker could barely force down a smile as the pacifying sensation of the desert surrounded her. Although far from the scalding temperatures she sensed whenever she prodded and nudged the sun along in its track around the planet, it was more like home than anywhere else. Dry. Stifling. Fully embraced by sunlight.\n\nHowever, she didn't bask in the feeling for long, as she shook herself back to reality when a couple of guards stomped up in front of her. The hubbub of ponies chattering away on streets filled her ears. As she opened her eyes, she saw she was still in the middle of Somnambula, the ancient capital of Maregypt bustling with ponies, zebra, and other creatures of all sizes around. Shouts and jeers as the rare car or jeep tried to get through the throngs of ponies filled her ears.\n\nAlthough it was thousands of years separated, it still felt like the same Somnambula that she recalled. Where there were once grand palaces along the Neighle River, it was now filled with a mix of business, apartment bloc, and the rare manor. What used to be white sandstone, perhaps plated with marble, was now steel and simple mud bricks.\n\n"How the grand have been humbled," she mused softly to herself. Turning her attention back to her guards, she simply stated, "You're dismissed."\n\n"Your Majesty, I'm afraid that—" one began to stammer before Daybreaker held up a hoof to silence him.\n\n"They're pacified. I wish to see their lives by myself." She held back a grin. Out of the corner of her eye, she had caught some movement near a group of ponies, and the rapid dart of a cutpurse pilfering citizens of their earnings. Perhaps it was conjecture, but what better way to solve the problem than presenting herself a target?\n\nWhile she was known, it was also a newly acquired territory of the Empire. Not everypony, especially lowlifes such as that scum, would know her appearance, or to fear an alicorn.\n\nAnd they'd soon find out why they should.\n\nWith a bow, her guards departed, and she traced the movements of the pickpocket. Surprisingly, he didn't veer toward her, even after multiple minutes of her being an obvious target. She flared her nostrils at the thought. Ignored? Her?\n\nWhile not as dramatic, she could still resolve the issue in another way. She cantered toward the last location she spotted the thief at, and waited. Sure enough, within a moment, she caught another movement of the cutpurse, and then powered her horn. Just as the younger stallion was about to slash another purse string, he froze, and was dragged back in a blood red glow.\n\nNonchalantly, Daybreaker grabbed the last bag he had taken, floated it over to the victim, and grinned. Then she sneered down at the criminal. Leaning toward him, she gazed into his frantically shaking eyes, and she snarled, "I believe we've not been introduced. I'm your Empress, and I don't take kindly to thieves.""

  solarreworked.410.d:0 ""I said no, Lord Commander," Raven Inkwell huffed as she straightened her posture and warded Lord Commander Blueblood from the Empress's chambers. Aside from the fact that he didn't have an appointment with Daybreaker, there was the slight detail that she was currently attempting to rest after exerting herself. As much as she was an alicorn, tied to the sun itself, she was still a pony.\n\nGoing for three days straight on reforming some laws into streamlined, efficient, orderly rules would wear anypony out.\n\nSmugly staring Raven down, Blueblood brushed a hoof against his dark uniform's breast pocket. After briefly inspecting it, he glanced back up toward Raven and inquired, "Oh, Raven? I'm one of Auntie's favorite ponies. Why do you think you can keep me out?" He snorted. "I will not be treated like a foal, like I was that one time!"\n\nMirth tugging at the edges of Raven's mouth, she leaned more heavily on her left hooves and appraised him. It might have been some time, but he really hadn't changed much. While he was technically her elder, it was still no contest on the mental maturity front.\n\nShe cringed internally about how that very thought implicated she wasn't as sophisticated as she believed.\n\nGlancing at the two guards that stood on either side of the doorway to Daybreaker's chambers, Raven weakly whinnied. They wouldn't defy his orders, and if he thought to perhaps take a bit of his frustration out on her...\n\nStill, she had a job to do. She sighed. "C—The Empress asked to not be disturbed."\n\n"Did she now?" Arching an eyebrow, Blueblood shot her a bemused, slightly playful expression. "And what would she say if she knew that you prevented news about Surprise's rebel cell being destroyed from reaching her?" He hummed loudly, mockingly. With a smarmy grin, he watched Raven as she squirmed, ever so slightly, and she attempted to retort back at him.\n\n"She would be—" She cut herself off. Daybreaker would be far from amused. Yet at the same time, she had given clear instructions to slumber. But Blueblood wasn't wrong, either.\n\nSauntering closer to Raven, Blueblood stared down at her and smirked. "Let me through, Raven. The Lord Commander wishes to speak to his Empress." Under his breath, she barely heard him grump, "And maybe this time she'll actually give me something in return."\n\nRaven slouched, and she finally shook her head. Either way she looked at it, she'd probably get a tongue-lashing, and rightfully so. Reluctantly slipping to the side, she simply stated, "Have at it.""

  solarreworked.411.d:0 "Verko's hands shook. Although he'd already poured himself a couple of shots of the good stuff, the normally calming, and more importantly, confidence-building effects of the [MAZ.GetAjdectiveCap] whisky did little to keep his nerves from coming through. That was why he had his claws clasped together, interwoven and locked tightly, to attempt to keep the jitteriness invisible.\n\nThe pony standing across from him in his dingy office was known. Very known. She had come alone and demanded to speak with him. Privately.\n\nTempest Shadow, former general of the Storm King, and if his sources were correct, now serving Daybreaker and the Solar Empire, nonchalantly cracked her neck as she briefly scanned the office. Flashing a nervous, half-toothed smile, he finally asked, "So, uh, Tempest, was it? What can I do you for?" It was best to feign ignorance, after all. At least coming across as intrigued and amenable would hopefully start negotiations off well.\n\nThere was only one reason she came here, though. He could already guess.\n\nTempest narrowed her eyes. "Oh, I'm sure you'd be VERY interested to hear what I have to say, wouldn't you?" She chuckled. As she did, Verko's blood froze and figuratively turned to ice. She paced the room, then glanced back at him. "I'm sure you learned your lesson last time you interfered with my mission."\n\nHe brushed down the few stray hairs on his head. Readjusting his glasses, he squeaked, "I-I was just working on bad information. Capper didn't say anything about—"\n\n"I don't care," Tempest interjected with a nicker. Slamming his jaw shut, Verko watched her with trepidation as she marched closer to his desk. "Daybreaker sent me to give you this warning." She leaned in closer, baring her teeth in a self-satisfied sneer. "Surrender Klugetown. It'd be inconsequential to wipe you off the map, but it'd be needless busywork for our military." She snorted. "The Maregyptians used to own this city, if you recall."\n\nVerko tensed. Looked like his suspicions were correct. Swallowing and appearing even more flustered than he was, he bent down to grab his whisky bottle again, and pressed a button under his desk while there. "I'll, um, have to think about it," he replied as he came up.\n\nTempest merely stared at him. "That was stupid," she stated. Directly afterward, the door to the office slammed open, and two, brutish minotaurs entered. Verko ducked as one swung at Tempest. As he came back up, there was a loud crackle and the crunch of breaking bone, and when he looked at the office again, both his guards were lying on their backs, out cold.\n\nHe gulped as Tempest turned, her horn still sparking. "Now," she quipped, "shall we conduct business?""

  solarreworked.412.d:0 "Breathing in as she stood outside one of the reported safe houses of the Klugetown Blueweed Syndicate, Tempest Shadow felt her pules quicken as she glanced over at one of her soldiers. Raids like this one were going to commence around the entire city in short order, but this was her own, personal interest. Although she had performed assaults just like this one hundreds of times already, it didn't stop the thrill of the fight from getting to her.\n\nA couple of denizens of the city, a zebra and one of the strange, anthropomorphic fish creatures, of which she still had never bothered to learn the species. When they saw Tempest, the fish thing halted and whimpered before bolting.\n\nShe gave a nod to the trooper on the other side of the door, and he laid a small crystal on it. Counting to three, she kicked the door right on the crystal, and there was a burst of magical energy that punched directly through, knocking the debris inward and skewering another fish thing in the process. As the victim lay gasping on the floor, Tempest and her squad charged in.\n\nInside, there was a dimly lit antechamber, where a couple of guards had been busy playing a game of cards. Before they could scramble for their guns, Tempest threw herself at them, coiling her body into a diving kick that collided with the closer directly in the chest. He fell, wheezing and coughing blood, and then she whirled to the second, clobbering him with her reinforced horseshoes on her hindlegs and getting a crunch as she broke his skull. He collapsed, twitching a few times in a death throe.\n\nCalmly snatching the keys on the dead guard, she first checked the door they were protecting. It was unlocked. She snorted. Crime families really needed better standards.\n\nInside the second room, there were a few more lackeys of the Blueweed Syndicate, although she and her soldiers dispatched of them with ease. Who she really cared about had darted behind some crates of blueweed in the scuffle. She scoffed. "Come out, Grubber," she demanded.\n\nSeconds later, her former lieutenant slipped out, tapping his claws together ashamedly. "H-H-Hey, Tempest!" he stammered. "L-Long time, no see?" He yelped when she yanked him with a forehoof.\n\n"Just shut up!" she snarled. Her horn sparkled furiously. As it cast bright blues and oranges on his face and singed his spiky hair, she snarled, "Now, we're going to catch up. On EVERYTHING. Especially Blueweed. Clear?"\n\nHe swallowed."

Much of the life of the city had been sapped in the wake of her occupation, not that it mattered much. If the hippogriffs were unhappy with her, what did she care? They had once served their purpose, saving Harmony, and for that, they had been allowed some freedoms, even if they didn't believe it to be the case.\n\nShe scoffed as she reached the guarded doors to the royal chambers. As much as it was entertaining to spend some time in Hippogriffia as a short vacation from the hustle and bustle of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], there were more important things to deal with. She nodded to the two guards, who opened the door to usher her inside.\n\nEntering, she smiled wanly at the large hippogriff in the room. Said hippogriff, Queen Novo, was glaring at her. Furiously.\n\n"What is it YOU want?" Novo demanded with a haughty snort. Ruffling her wing feathers, which were bound tightly, she quipped, "Wanting to gloat at being oh so high and mighty?" She rolled her eyes. "You got a captive audience, honey."\n\n"Please, Novo, I wouldn't dare when we were once allies," Daybreaker replied with a dismissive with of a forehoof. Marching around to stand within Novo's line of sight, she added, "I merely come offering a proposal." Novo was silent. If anything, the scowl on her face managed to deepen further. Daybreaker grinned and bared her teeth.\n\n"My ponies and your hippogriffs were once friends, working together to preserve Harmony. Maintain Order." Daybreaker let herself pause. Novo still stayed quiet. Were she to reach out a talon, she could slice the tension in the room like a knife through butter.\n\nAt last, Novo cawed and declared, "Celestia, or Daybreaker, or whatever it is that you call yourself. Honey, if you think that any amount of schmoozing up to me or playing up my strengths will get me to work for you, you got another thing coming."\n\nDaybreaker's eyes narrowed. "I wouldn't dream of thinking you cooperative, which is why I thought it best to provide some motivation." At that, she teleported a map into the room. Traced across the water and land of North Zebrica, a new border had been drawn. "I suggest that this would be appropriate territory for griffs and seaponies to live in peace. You can keep the headaches away, so I can focus on my own problems."\n\nWith Novo's continued defiant glare, she added, "Oh, and perhaps Skystar can continue her studies of Hippogriffian Harmony if you agree. If not... well, she better be a quick student." Sneering, she merely tilted her head."

Pressing a forehoof against her head, Dawnbreak grunted an additional thought with a smidgen of testiness, "Geez, if that was any LESS inspiring and Daybreaker-focused, you'd think it was just some TED Talk or the like."\n\n"A what, High Priestess?" Stellar inquired before she suppressed a yawn. Shaking her head, she stated, "I-I'm afraid that I—"\n\nDawnbreak snarled and waved a hoof. "Forget it. Just some stupid lecture series from... where I used to be."\n\nStellar started to nod before she yelped when she slammed into Prince Blueblood, who was engrossed in his own conversation with a pair of his own aides. As she fell backward, the notes and liners that she had held onto for Sunset flew in multiple directions and scattered on the floor. Stellar rapidly apologized and did what she could to swipe them out of the air or off the ground. Dawnbreak furrowed her brow.\n\n"Blueblood." Almost with palpable disgust, she drew out his name for a couple of seconds. In return, he scrutinized her as he brushed himself off from where Stellar had slammed into him.\n\n"Shimmer," he retorted. After checking that his uniform had not been wrinkled, he snorted. "I see that you've not taken to teaching your servants to be careful. Figures. You always did buck rules."\n\nFlushing a slightly deeper red, Dawnbreak countered, "Like you obeyed Daybreaker's requirements, either, Blueblood!" At that, she stated coldly, "I'd suggest you move out of our way." She nickered. "We're a bit busy. Could already feel a headache before I had to look at you."\n\nIn mock shock, Blueblood retorted, "Why, you believe you actually can order ME around? Auntie's second of the military?" Glancing around at his entourage, he smiled, "Dawnbreak, I believe that—"\n\nInterjecting with a hum, Dawnbreak tilted her head and she began, "Hey, Blueblood, you remember that time when it was just you and me and how you managed to clip Philomena's wing with a crossbow bolt? How you got a gardener to take the fall? Or maybe when you exposed her previous assistant to low levels of thaumaturgic radiation for fun?" A smarmy smile spreading across her lips, she stated, "I have plenty of others, too. You want to try me? See what Daybreaker will do when she finds out?"\n\nSilently, Blueblood turned beet red and puffed out his cheeks. Without a word, he stepped to the side, and Dawnbreak and Stellar continued on their way. Dawnbreak grinned."

More accurately, it would be best described as a place where she could uncomfortably rest. Aside from the thin cot that was provided, there was absolutely nothing else inside. Maybe also a nice view of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but not much else.\n\nAt Daybreaker's entrance, Luna stirred with a small snort and then rubbed at her eyes. They were like hollow sockets, highlighted by the circles under them and the haunted appearance that she seemed to be carrying with her. For a moment, she blearily stared at Daybreaker, then merely snorted and rolled over.\n\nDaybreaker clicked her tongue. "Come now, Lulu, is that any way to greet your sister?" She swished her tail. "I thought letting you have some time to cool off would make our relationship more amicable."\n\n"I have nothing to say to you, cretin," Luna grunted.\n\nDaybreaker whinnied. As her mane flashed a bright blue, she bared her teeth and stalked inwards. "Luna, what did we agree about calling each other—"\n\n"Do not even consider speaking to me like my sister!" interjected Luna. Whipping up to glower directly at Daybreaker, she scowled and huffed. "You clearly wish to flap your tongue in my presence. I suggest you do so quickly, lest I conceive a way to be free from my bonds." As if on instinct, her horn flickered and crackled, suppressed by the pair of inhibitor rings on it.\n\nWhile scraping a chunk of grime off the floor of the prison, Daybreaker nickered and declared, "Must we only discuss business? What happened to our personal time, Luna?"\n\n"You."\n\nTittering, Daybreaker shook her head and sighed. "I've not changed, Lulu. I've only... stretched my expanded my horizons." She moved closer to Luna. Leaning down and practically pressing her muzzle against Luna's, she sneered, "I only wished to help you see things correctly. After all, you do wish to see our ponies prosper, do you not?"\n\n"Speak you like we desire the same goal?!" Luna bellowed, her mane whipping about frantically in frustration. Daybreaker merely shot her a goading grin.\n\nAs she pulled back, she added, "Oh, no, Lulu. I desire to go much, much further than your puny mind ever thought to go." With a derisive chuckle, she quipped, "But, of course, that's why I'm here.""

  solarreworked.416.d:0 ""You believe that we are nothing alike anymore, no?" Daybreaker arched an eyebrow. From where she stood, proudly towering over Luna, she could almost see her sister's posture and confidence deflate like a sack of wet leaves being beaten down. For a moment, there was a brief leap of excitement in her heart, but then Luna steeled herself. Although she didn't say anything, Luna clearly had rejected the seeds of doubt that had been sown.\n\nAs if to answer Daybreaker's question, Luna grumbled, "Could it be more obvious to an observer?" She snorted and got to her hooves. With her fur matted and her wing feathers dirtied and grime-covered to the point of uselessness, she failed to invoke much in the way of any fear in Daybreaker. However, Daybreaker did swallow, if only faintly, at Luna's appearance.\n\n"Have you some grand speech planned, beast?" Luna inquired. A soft smirk formed on her muzzle. "Or have you merely come so that you could hear the warm air leave your throat?" Daybreaker bristled slightly. In response, Luna's smile grew further. Sweeping a hoof to point out the barred window, she inquired, "Did you believe that you could simply talk me into submission? Or perhaps, like the ponies you have forced to kowtow to you, you convinced yourself I would simply break upon my permanent imprisonment?"\n\nBefore Daybreaker could get in a word, she was forced to step back as Luna slunk toward her, eyes practically burning with anger. "Did you think that your accomplishments would awe me?" Another step. A further brow furrowing. "Did you believe that attempting to promise me something or convincing me I'd be fighting Harmony would succeed?"\n\n"I—"\n\n"Nay, you believed that you had the upper hoof, simply because I languish within your dungeons." By now, Luna was practically against Daybreaker's chest plate. Despite her smaller stature, her bravado projected an aura of authority so fierce that it made Daybreaker stammer, if only for a second or two.\n\nAfter a sputter, Daybreaker snapped, "Enough! I am not here to be grilled by YOU! You are to be enlightened, and—"\n\nLuna scoffed. Although barely visible, a couple of darker tracts appeared on her cheeks. "'Tia, do you really—"\n\n"Do NOT speak that name!" Reflexively jumping back a few inches from Luna at her old name, Daybreaker flared her wings and snapped, "I am not pathetic like she once was! I have brought stability and order to Harmony! Ponies have prospered because of ME!"\n\nLuna merely shook her head."

Her mane whipped and thrashed in the air, sending small specks of flaming material to splash against the stonework of the prison cell. Weakly smiling, Luna stated while Daybreaker heaved, "'Tia, this is not for what we have striven." She pointed through the window again.\n\nAlthough it was only a small view, the backdrop of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] revealed some of the larger towers put up in the last few years. While Daybreaker didn't move, she could visualize the lower streets of the city perfectly fine, and from how Luna wasn't even looking out the barred window, she probably had memorized that as well during her imprisonment.\n\n"Is it not?!" Daybreaker interjected, her voice cracking, if only barely. She gritted her teeth together as her mind raced. Was this not her process?! What was going on?\n\nLuna shook her head again. "Have you not measured the impact of your decisions? Your laws? Your... desire to preserve Harmony?"\n\nDaybreaker snorted. Some of her confidence returning as a swell of gusto in her chest, she puffed it out slightly and smirked. "Of course! I have fixed much of the destitution. Ponies have been made secure. Harmony has been perfected through its order. Is this not what we all wished for?"\n\nWith a shrug, Luna inquired, "Mayhap you have had some progress. That will I begrudgingly concede." She sighed. Hanging her head and trotting toward the window, she stated, "Let us take your Legion of Labor as an example. Why did you create it?"\n\n"Poverty was growing. Criminals were wasting away in—"\n\n"And what caused this poverty, 'Tia? What was the instigation of these crimes?" Moving back from the window, Luna glared directly into Daybreaker's soul, and the Empress took another step or two back, her hairs bristling on the back of her neck.\n\nWith a fiery stomp of her hoof, Daybreaker barked while she powered her horn without thinking, "The criminals were guilty of breaking Harmony with others. They ultimately were given more than they deserve!"\n\n"And the poor?"\n\nFor a moment, Daybreaker worked her tongue across one of her cheeks, and she glanced away. Her mind searched for an appropriate answer. Likewise, it was also trying determine the angle which Luna was choosing. While her sister was sharp-witted, so was she. After all, they were cut from the same cloth. "I will not answer that."\n\nLuna flared her nostrils."

When Daybreaker stayed silent, Luna arched a brow. She scrutinized Daybreaker. "Is that not... intriguing?"\n\nDaybreaker snorted.\n\nClicking her tongue and making Daybreaker flinch at the harsh sound, Luna moved back toward her cot. "'Tia, I know that you came here for a reason. Can you not see that these laws are madness? A legion dedicated to forced labor? The poor unable to resist, the criminals falsely accused and then sent to this organization? How many have perished toiling for it?" Shooting a harsh glower at Daybreaker, she waited while tapping a hoof on the ground for a moment, then repeated, "How many?"\n\nDaybreaker squirmed uncomfortably. Gone were her plans for convincing Luna to see things as she did. Now, it was merely enough to escape mentally unscathed. However, there was no answer that would be satisfactory to Luna's question. Even not responding was an indication in and of itself.\n\nClearly reading Daybreaker's mind, Luna grinned and stated, "I believe that my case has been proven." She hopped back up on her cot. For a moment, she stared at Daybreaker, her harsh expression slowly softening to one of pain and worry.\n\n"'Tia, you must listen to my words! These have all led to more—"\n\n"Enough!" Daybreaker finally snapped, veins bulging on her neck as she gritted her teeth. Grinding her jaw, she growled and grumbled momentarily, her mane glowing a bright blue as her fur practically smoked from the rage building in her chest. As her heart pumped against her ribs, threatening to break out of it, she barked, "I will not be lectured by you, Luna! I have done this for my ponies! I have done all this to protect Harmony, and you would see it fall!"\n\n"I merely wish to see our ponies to live freely, 'Tia, but you have seen that it will never happen." She tapped the inhibitor rings on her horn. Lying back on her cot, she merely stared up at the ceiling, then, after a sigh, she closed her eyes. "Goodbye, Daybreaker. I have nothing else to say to you."\n\nDaybreaker swallowed. Spinning on her heels, her brain alight replaying the conversation, she barely heard Luna mumble, "Farewell, Sister. I never knew you.""

  solarreworked.419.d:0 ""I still protest that you are undertaking this, God-Empress," griped one of the soldiers who comprised the escort that surrounded Daybreaker as they traveled, by jeep, out of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The dust kicked up by the speed of the motorcade following them cast a haze across the sky, making her Sun appear like it was punching through a coffee filter.\n\nWith a side-eyed glance, Daybreaker merely smirked and shook her head. "Is it too much for a goddess to survey her domain, or an empress to see her wayward ponies?" She dismissively waved a hoof. "Before you remind me of the heretics that have yet to FULLY cleansed from the land, don't. I am quite aware of the situation. My servants Kibitz and Raven remind me all too often."\n\nShifting nervously in his seat beside her, the soldier merely bit his tongue and switched his attention to looking out the windshield of the jeep. It wasn't like Daybreaker was without protection, as, after all, the jeep alone contained half a dozen ponies, all ready to die for her if need be. Still, he nickered anxiously as there was a sudden crack a short while later, as they passed through a glade on the fringes of the Everfree Forest.\n\nLike him, Daybreaker jerked her head in the direction of the noise, which had startled a number of birds that were nesting within the trees. One of the end cars of the motorcade stopped to investigate, and the rest slowed enough so that they could practically brake and defend the Empress if needed. However, a few seconds later, a raccoon scampered out of the brush, barely visible at the Daybreaker's distance.\n\nThe soldier let out an audible sigh, just before there was another crack, and Daybreaker's fur was splattered crimson. Sliding to the floor of the jeep, the soldier sputtered and choked as a large hole in his neck gushed blood. In an instant, the motorcade came to a stop, and Daybreaker and her other guards hopped out of the jeep to take cover from where the bullet had come. Daybreaker had already summoned a shield.\n\nThinly grinning, she switched her attention to the various trees, squinting as she tried to peer into the gloom of the underbrush. After that single gunshot, the air was heavy with tension. What birds there should have been were silent, and only the occasional noise of the cricket or another insect could be discerned.\n\nStanding straighter, Daybreaker shot a bolt into the forest, which momentarily bloomed with light. In response, one of the trucks, still filled with soldiers, exploded into a brilliant fireball."

  solarreworked.420.d:0 "Raining from the sky like ash from a volcano, debris of the truck that had detonated into an inferno pelted the ground of the road along the edge of the Everfree Forest. Some of the flaming shards were carried toward the treeline and descended to the forest floor. Within seconds, smoke started to filter up through the leaves and into the sky, leaving the sunlight a darkened, orange glow.\n\nWith the destruction of part of the motorcade, the trees were suddenly alight with gunfire, as small sparks of light appeared in random intervals through the floral veil. A few bullets pinged off Daybreaker's shield and the jeep she was in front of. Valiantly, her escort returned fire, as some of the other soldiers disembarked of the other two trucks. After ensuring that the soldiers near her were secure, Daybreaker soared into the sky, her horn flaring with energy. She cackled as she felt adrenaline course through her veins.\n\nA sneer formed on her muzzle. If her ambushers were so confident in their success, then they would have to ensure they weren't blinded by the Sun!\n\nSwooshing through the treetops, she fired blindly beams of burning magic, roasting sections of the forest in seconds. Soot and ash belched up from the canopy floor, and she caught a couple of screams in the process. The form of a pony, entirely engulfed in fire, staggered out from the edge of the treeline, desperately smacking themselves and rolling on the ground before finally going limp.\n\nDaybreaker sneered.\n\nApparently that heresy worry was more warranted than initially thought. But it was no matter.\n\nShe dove toward a clearing just beyond the inside of the forest, where she spotted somepony dart to another end, and she landed with a deafening crash. As she did, there was another blooming fireball from the road, and a number of gunshots ceased firing afterward. She smirked.\n\nBaring her teeth giddily, she sprinted to the cover that her opponents believed would protect them, and then screamed in an animalistic tone. Where she saw a form, she stomped with all her momentum, and there was a sickening crunch as she connected with a prone pony's spine. Not a single cry was heard from the victim.\n\nShe continued with the motion, and jabbed her horn downward at the other, faint shape in the brush. A soft squelch answered her, and she withdrew it to feel blood dribble down her forehead. Pulling back on the flora, she revealed a pony, writhing once or twice, before going still.\n\nShe sniffed. Heretic. Deserving of such a fate.\n\nBefore she could think further, she heard hooves behind her, and she saw a pair of ponies aiming at her, and she merely smiled menacingly. At least, she did until there was one more explosion, which caught her attention briefly enough that something connected with the back of her head, and she stumbled to the ground, before half a dozen ponies were on her to hold her down.\n\nOne final crack against her head, and her vision swam to black."

  solarreworked.421.d:0 "She wasn't out for long. That much she was certain about.\n\nAs Daybreaker's cleared while she blinked her eyes, she ascertained that merely by the fact that the Sun had not moved much in the sky. While she did guide the Sun in its course, it could drift for a short time without her interference. Therefore, it could not have been much more than fifteen minutes since she was overwhelmed, yet she had been moved far enough from where the attack had been that she was unsure where she now rested.\n\nSomewhere deeper in the Everfree, perhaps closer to her old castle, perhaps not. Either way, the soft pressure at the base of her horn was indicative of an inhibitor ring. She was powerless.\n\nGlancing around, she figured she was in a clearing, given that there were at least LESS trees than the rest of the Everfree. On all sides, ponies, nervous and fidgety, watched her. Some were armed, others appeared like they were merely civilians. Every single one of them made her heart burn with fury. A low growl built in her throat as there was a cracking of twigs on the ground, and she turned her head.\n\nShe started. A confused whinny escaped her throat.\n\nTrotting into the clearing was a rather familiar pony; an older stallion, balding, but with an impressive mustache. When he saw her, his eyes lost a bit of their shine, and he held back a tired sigh. Daybreaker could only stutter, "Kibitz?"\n\n"Your... majesty," Kibitz eventually replied with a small bow. "I hope that the, er, trip wasn't too unpleasant." Daybreaker merely glowered at him for a moment, her mane swiftly transitioning from a soft orange to a brighter yellow. A couple of ponies near her stepped away from the heat radiating off her.\n\n"You lead this band of HERETICS?" Spitting the last word, Daybreaker jutted her fangs with a harsh scowl.\n\n"Not heretics, Princess, loyalists." Kibitz looked to each and every one of the ponies there, and earned nods. "You... you aren't yourself, Princess. You touring Equestria was perfect chance for us to guard you until you—"\n\n"I am entirely well!" Daybreaker snapped.\n\n"No, Princess, you aren't. This is all madness! A cult around yourself? Arresting ponies for innocent actions? Where did the love of Harmony go?" Kibitz frowned. Stepping a bit closer, he shook his head. Daybreaker's mane brightened further. Gazing past her, he added, "We are not far, my ponies. Once we get aid from one of the other Princesses, we can—"\n\n"You will not win so easily, my former servant," Daybreaker snarled.\n\n"Princess, your words pain me, but I will live with them." Stiffening and ruffling his mustache, he muttered, "I'd rather be remembered a traitor than a mindless drone.""

  solarreworked.422.d:0 "Straining against her bonds, Daybreaker fumed and grunted as she remained tightly held by a number of chains, far tougher than a typical earth pony could break. Although she had gotten them to crack slightly, the metal was still far too durable to do much more. By now, the Sun had slowed to a stop, although not long enough to be noticeable or cause alarm. At least not yet.\n\nLike she surmised, the heretics were using her old castle for a base. Given its proximity to [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it was logical. At the moment, she could only watch as Kibitz waited for a pale cream unicorn fiddled with a radio unit. The mare grumbled and griped as she twisted some dials and tested frequencies. There was one squeal that was loud enough to reach Daybreaker's spot.\n\nAfter a couple of soft curses from the unicorn, Kibitz huffed and returned to Daybreaker. For a moment, he looked at her, then polished his pocket watch. Although some of his suit was stained from his trek through the Everfree, he didn't appear to care. "I will say, Princess, it was surprising that you wished to see your country. It is the first time in my lifetime you have done this." Furrowing his brow, he muttered, "I wish that we could have avoided more bloodshed, though."\n\n"My ponies fought to protect Harmony. To keep Order. To die for ME," hissed Daybreaker, her mane turning from a nearly searing yellow glow to a dull purple. It only took a moment to reach a hot blue. Flinching and stepping back, Kibitz covered his eyes as she continued to simmer. At his discomfort, she grinned. "And this was not a fluke, Kibitz."\n\nWith a flicker of confusion, he stepped back toward the unicorn, and he murmured, "White Noise, how much longer?" Yet before the unicorn could answer, Daybreaker chuckled.\n\n"Honestly, Kibitz, do you think that a goddess is defenseless? Do you think that she makes these kind of mistakes?" As she asked these questions, her mane's intensity increased. Whipping and thrashing about, it slapped at the chains, and left whatever it hit molten slag. Even the shielded chains were beginning to lose form.\n\nSnarling and flashing her fangs, Daybreaker bellowed, "I am the Sun itself! I am HARMONY!" So far, the inhibitor ring held, but it radiated in a dull red. In response, Kibitz staggered back, and he called for White Noise to sound an alarm. Before she could, though, the inhibitor ring sparked and sputtered as its magical bonds fizzled out from its form being lost, and Daybreaker tittered, "You fell right into my trap. Thanks for ratting out yourself and all those damned with you."\n\nKibitz yelped as his shirt was grabbed by blood red magic, just as a blaring siren carried through the castle hallways outside. Daybreaker only snickered. "Goodbye, Kibitz.""

  solarreworked.423.d:0 "Smacking her lips, Daybreaker tasted the tea that had been presented for her, and nodded her head approvingly. It had been far too long since she had had any Arisian blends, and the subtle taste of citrus and chocolate danced on her tongue as she finished her sip. She carefully placed her cup back on the table and let out a sigh, her flowing mane a gentle wave of fire and deep, contented red.\n\nAs she leaned back in her recliner, she smirked at the hippogriff across from her, who was eyeing her with distrust. That mattered little, though. She inquired, "So, Novo, how have things been? We haven't talked in ages, and I recall our chats being quite enjoyable." She tittered. "I still can't believe that Sunrise thought you were called queen of the HIPPOS."\n\n"Oh, yeah, laugh it up. This is all so amusing to you, ain't it?" Novo shot back. As she did, she moved only a couple of inches on her recliner before there was the rattle of guns being trained on her. At each corner of the small sun porch, there was an Imperial soldier, readily waiting. Novo barely paid them any mind.\n\n"Gonna call them off so I can drink my own tea?" she asked snarkily. When Daybreaker nodded at them, she gave a small, "Good," and leaned forward to take her drink. "To answer your question, let me ask you one in return. How'd you feel if you'd been conquered by some warmonger, placed under house arrest for gods know how long, and, oh, used by said warmonger to act like their puppet?"\n\nAt that, she blinked rapidly, in an almost innocent fashion. Running one of her claws along the edge of her teacup, she asked, "Sound familiar?"\n\nDaybreaker's mane began to glow a harsher orange, but her face remained unchanged. "Why, I haven't the faintest idea, Novo," she quipped, although her voice was about as flat as Equus's central plains. Staring briefly out the open air balcony of the sun porch, she watched as pegasi and hippogriffs worked together to repair one of the taller structures in Aris. "It sounds like nocreature I know."\n\n"Mmm, yeah, a true mystery." With a small squawk, Novo stretched her wings and retorted, "I'm obviously doing this because I want to. We might have been friends, but now?" She shook her head.\n\nFurrowing her brow for a moment, Daybreaker inspected her tea, put it back on the table again, and got up. "I see," she replied with a snort. Pacing the room once, she ended up beside Novo, and leaned down. "Then let me give you a warning, Queen Novo of Hippogriffia: you have been given an honor in being reinstated and ruling an expanded realm. Do not toy with my patience by getting ideas of independence." A faint smirk flashed across her muzzle. "And this isn't just for your safety. Please consider what would happen, if your darling Skystar were to have a small... accident, shall we say?"\n\nAs Novo paled, Daybreaker trotted off, her mane blazing a bright blue."

  solarreworked.424.d:0 "Daybreaker inhaled. As she did, her nerves flitted and fluttered in her gut as she counted the seconds until she would arrive. Each flap of her wings propelled her through the sky, like a bullet from an oversized gun. Dodging clouds that had been neglected, she tore through one or two that she didn't have time to react to, and she caught the screams of her ponies from below on a battlefield.\n\nFires raged across the vale that they had cornered Tirek in, but she couldn't make out the fine details. Occasionally, a burst of orange fire and a trail of smoke carried from one of the artillery guns that her troops had, but she couldn't see any of her soldiers. She could, however, see the red form of Tirek, the centaur supersized due to his magic. And that which he'd already drained from her ponies.\n\nHer head ached and her body strained. Magic coursed through her, but, it would be a little surprise for Tirek if he tried anything.\n\nWith a final grin, she dove toward the battlefield, impacting within seconds in a cloud of dust and dirt. She coughed a couple of times, and then hopped out of the way as a massive fist zoomed toward her. Bringing up a shield, she repelled the sibling of the first, and it bounced off, shattering the spell in the process.\n\nDaybreaker staggered, but soon climbed. Before her, standing at least three times her hight, was Tirek. His horns sparked and sputtered with the magic of her ponies he had consumed, and he bore his teeth in a wicked grin. "Well, well, well," he exclaimed, his voice booming across the field. "Looks like little Celestia—or should I say Daybreaker—decided to bring her sorry rump to me!" He whipped up a hand, blocking an artillery shell that would have hit his head.\n\nIt exploded on impact.\n\nAs the shockwave washed over Daybreaker, she stepped back and bared her teeth. "You'll no longer threaten Harmony." She furrowed her brow. "Ever again, Tirek."\n\nFor a second, Tirek gawked at her, then he burst into hysterics. He pointed once at her, then bellowed, "We tried this once before, Celestia. I see that this time you didn't dump all your magic into your sycophant." He snorted. "Brave. But foolish." At that, he darted at her, hands outstretched. Although she caught his movement well enough in time to dodge, she didn't.\n\nWith a woof, she felt his fingers tighten on her, and she struggled. However, she barely used any of her energy. When she was brought up to eye level with him, he huffed. "Now, why'd you even come here? This was almost too easy." At that, he opened his mouth and inhaled.\n\nWith a moan, Daybreaker sensed her magic ripping away, like he was drawing blood from every pore at once. Holding back a scream of pain when it increased to a sharp pierce of her head, she felt the flow suddenly cease, and was dropped by Tirek. As she hit the ground and unsteadily got to her hooves, she looked up as Tirek batted at his throat.\n\nFlames practically spouted from his mouth and eyes, and as he staggered back, Daybreaker clicked her tongue. "Please, idiot. You think I'd be foolish enough to not come prepared? Enjoy choking on the Sun itself!" She cackled. "I'm entwined with it! Temporarily sending my essence there, to be 'devoured' with it, was worth the pain." She leaned down and kicked him in the chest. He coughed, still struggling with the magic and solar plasma, and she nickered, "Enjoy the heartburn. Shame it won't actually kill you, but enough it'll force all that magic back out."\n\nWith a small sigh, she got up. Staggering toward her forces, she exclaimed, "Take him back to Tartarus." She glanced back at the flames that had launched from his throat."

  solarreworked.429.d:0 ""It's all on fire! Everypony evacuate! Bring a fire hose! Where did—"\n\nA burst of static crackled from the portable radio that was strapped to Clean Clippings' side. Her lungs straining, she bolted across the campsite, which was afire with deafening cracks and booms from gunshots and cannon fire. Overhead, a whistling shell zoomed by and impacted a hundred or so feet from her. Its blinding explosion nearly knocked her to the ground, but she was helped back to her hooves by the rest of her squad.\n\nWhere had the damn Solarists even come from? This area was supposed to be secure, but intel must have been wrong. A single shudder worked down her spine. If [NLR.GetLeader] could be blindsided with this, what would happen if the Solarists got even smarter?\n\nHer heart jumped. More crackles and sputters from her radio coughed through its speaker, and she turned her attention to the command center, which was ablaze with orange tongues of flame. An acrid stench of burning flesh mixed with the soot and smoke of the wood, and her throat tightened in response. Gagging a couple of times, she motioned for her squad to move out. In the rear, somepony grabbed a fire hose, which was attached to one of two water towers. When they had been under active risk of attack earlier, having a couple in case a stray shell set something on fire was wise. They hadn't been taken down yet, and that was now probably for the best.\n\n"Dear stars, who is that?" a voice came through on her radio. It was strained, choking at air. "This is Lieutenant Night Breeze, requesting immediate—" With a scream, the radio communication went dead. Seconds later, the tower that emerged from the center teetered and bent, then collapsed as part of the center fell with it.\n\nHeart pumping, Clean ordered her group to move in and fan out. In the back of her mind, she merely imagined how many were dead. Whatever hit the command center had done so without warning. It was an inferno before the real battle started.\n\nCovering her nose and steadying her pistol, Clean dove into a window and rolled to a stop in a clear section of floor. Within inches of her, conflagrations licked at the air, crackling and popping as they fed on the wood flooring. She gagged. Shortly afterward, the soldier with the water house doused the outside, then hopped in, before spraying some more water on the flames.\n\nAs they died down, she caught shrieks from her squadmates and caught indistinct chatter on her radio. "What was that?!" she demanded. "Sitrep, now!" Before she could get a response, the wall blew in, and a pony, ignited with orange fire, barreled through. Her fellow trooper instantly sprayed the pony down, and Clean coughed as the room filled with steam.\n\nHeat still battered her face, and when she opened her eyes as the cloud cleared, she whimpered. Staring directly at her, yellow eyes glowing with fury, was a fiery alicorn. Daybreaker Sun. Her fur was soaked. Her mane still sizzled. She bore her fangs.\n\nClean gulped."

Massaging her temples usually helped alleviate the discomfort, but today... she sighed. Today was going to be one of those days. When the gentle working of her head didn't work, she let out a moan and glanced away from the rest of her high command. She got a stare or two, but was otherwise left to her own devices.\n\nAs she cast her eyes over the assembled ponies, all from walks of life that would have belied a military interest, she flicked an ear when there was a soft noise nearby. She furrowed her brow. Focusing on where she caught the noise, she met the eyes of Granny Smith, who seemed to bore right through her for a moment before returning to listening to the strategist recently promoted by Blueblood, Schadenfreude, give his suggestions.\n\nAt this point, any and all help was appreciated, even if some of Schaden's ideas were a tad... unorthodox.\n\n"Current estimates place their forces' strength at approximately one point three times our own in..."\n\nCelestia twitched. There was that noise again. Looking back at Granny Smith, she peered at the elderly mare and hummed. It sounded like it came from Granny's direction, but at the same time, it didn't. She strained to tune out Schaden's droning.\n\nNothing. Granny must have—\n\n"Burn. Burn them to ash."\n\nNo, she heard it distinctly that time. "Did you hear that?" she blurted out, curiosity getting the better of her. After her impulsive question, she immediately cupped a feather over her mouth and paused for a second. Everypony gazed at her. Her face blushing, she stated, "N-Never mind. I thought I heard somepony talking." She shook her head. "Must have been the—"\n\n"Burn them all."\n\nCelestia's mind hitched. She stuttered a couple of times, and then she heard Flash Magnus inquire, "Princess, is everything all right?" He squinted. "You... do look a bit tired. Have you slept much lately?"\n\nPursing her lips, Celestia countered with another proclamation. "It's nothing. I-I imagined it." She rubbed her forehead. "You're right, Flash. I probably could use a little sleep." She clenched her jaw tightly. "But only after Schadenfreude finishes his analysis. My ponies must be kept safe!"\n\nShe struck the table in front of her with a hoof. Half the ponies jumped. When she pulled her hoof away, she blinked in surprise. "I think... I'll go lie down now, actually."\n\nShe pulled away, leaving a scorching imprint of her hoof in the wood of the table."

With a forced grin, she took in Blueblood, who was shooting daggers at Dawnbreak. Dawnbreak merely smiled innocently as she strode up next to Blueblood, and she gave a small curtsy.\n\n"What is it now, oh dearest nephew?" Daybreaker inquired, motioning the guards that had been walking with her to her next meeting with a delegate from one of the northern fringes of the Empire to step away. In the back of her mind, she wished that it wasn't another trite complaint. She was sorely disappointed.\n\n"SHE—" Blueblood jabbed a hoof at Dawnbreak "—keeps stealing my best soldiers!"\n\nWith a cocky raise of her eyebrows, Dawnbreak leaned slightly back onto her hindlegs, and pursed her lips. She said nothing in defense. Then again, she didn't really have to.\n\n"Nephew, to speak truthfully, Dawnbreak is no more my favorite than Sunrise or yourself," hissed Daybreaker. Already she was developing a migraine, which was driving thick, sharp spikes into her brain. Getting cornered in the hallways of her palace was far from an idea of an enjoyable time with either Blueblood or Dawnbreak.\n\n"It's not like I took ALL your best, Bluey," Dawnbreak shot back. Instantly, Blueblood's face reddened and his cheeks puffed out. With a furious exhale, which slipped through his nostrils like wind through the crack of a doorway, he grimaced so deeply it almost hid his eyes entirely.\n\n"Oh really?" he snapped. "Then explain to me why you went ahead and approved, YOURSELF, with those little 'Auntie's chosen' powers of yours my top FIVE officers plus their entire companies?!" Flecks of spittle flew from his mouth and splattered on Dawnbreak. She tiredly wiped it away.\n\n"They simply would flourish more under me than you," Dawnbreak replied with a shrug. Sauntering closer to him, she leaned within a few inches of his face and smirked. "Of course, if you want to lay your grievances against me, I know that the Empress is all ears. All the time." Daybreaker rolled her eyes.\n\nPatting Blueblood on the head, Dawnbreak chirped, "Cheer up, Bluey. You had your fun while I was away. If you were as good at leadership as you are of filling hot air balloons, I wouldn't have to sequester your brightest to be looked after." She glanced at Daybreaker. "If you've heard Blueblood's tantrum, can I go now?"\n\nDaybreaker waved her off. With another bow, Dawnbreak departed, although she flashed Blueblood another smarmy smile. When Dawnbreak rounded a corner, Blueblood bellowed, "She can't do this to me!"\n\n"She just did, nephew. Now leave me in peace for something ACTUALLY important." At that, Daybreaker stalked off, Blueblood sputtering behind her."

Bright flashes of light bounced around the enclosure as Brey Trottenborough brought a number of ponies with cameras into the small, closed off room. Bands of mucus from the hive's ceiling dripped and dribbled off of artificial stalactites, leaving puddles of miasmatic fluids on the floor.\n\nInside the enclosure, built as a ward against the insectoid creatures on the other side, about half a dozen changelings gathered and hissed collectively at the assembled ponies. There were a number of soft gasps and exclamations of wonder at the prizes.\n\n"There are a number of these enclosures scattered across [CHN.GetNameDef]," Trottenborough stated matter-of-factly. Walking up to the pen, he brushed aside some of his greying mane and peered at the nearest changeling. "What possesses them to resist?" He didn't flinch when a rock came hurtling toward him and impacted against the bars. "Do they crave chaos? Do they seek to sow discord and corrupt our youth?"\n\n"We just want food!" one of the changelings inside bellowed back at him. "You ain't fed us properly for a month! If you're going to keep us here, you might as well—" Before that changeling could finish, though, he screamed, as did the others, as a number of ponies raised their cameras to take more pictures.\n\nWhen the chorus of bright lights faded, the changelings shook their heads, all collectively getting their bearings again. As they did, Trottenborough added, "They are fascinating creatures. Feeding off emotions. They also can digest common food, but it is not comfortable for them." He tossed a few bundles of hay inside the enclosure.\n\n"Could you give me some hayfries with that?" another changeling in there chirped.\n\n"Have you asked any of them how they feel cooped up in there?" somepony from the crowd inquired. When she finished, the changelings, effectively captives given they were in a tunnel that didn't open to the outside world and they were sealed in from the enclosure's barred doors, glared at her.\n\n"Oh, once or twice." Trottenborough rolled his eyes, then cleared his throat. Pointing at the nearest changeling, he demanded, "You there, how do you like being alone from the Empress?"\n\n"I mean, it's kinda lonely," the indicated changeling muttered. "Do you think we could—"\n\n"There, you see? They fight because they're without hope. Desperate to see their queen restored." At that, Trottenborough turned around and ushered the crowd out.

Gaping and staring at the pony who his scouts had reported they had picked up escaping from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], he shook his head. Was it really her?\n\nDisheveled, dirtied, and dreary, Princess Twilight Sparkle brightened as Caltrop entered the small shack. Bands of sunlight peeked through the window, painting over her mane with a golden sheen. Although she was a tad bloodied, she didn't seem to really mind. Her eyes lit up. Bearing her teeth, she stood from where she sat, although she wobbled on her hooves when she did.\n\n"Woah!" she exclaimed, then sat back down. Caltrop spotted that she was also caked in sweat. Some dried froth was barely visible around the edges of her mouth. When she was passed a canteen of water by one of the scouts, she nodded appreciatively. After guzzling it, she stated, "It's good to see you again, General Decay."\n\n"Please, Caltrop is fine." He eyed her momentarily.\n\nBrushing aside some of her mane, Twilight added, "I didn't expect to encounter anypony." She fidgeted. "Those guards were close to capturing me. Eluding them—"\n\n"You're safe now, Princess, but, I have to ask—" Caltrop approached her, wariness in his gait "—why didn't you use magic to escape?" Eyeing her horn, he stated, "You don't have an inhibitor ring around it, nor is there any sign of injury from breaking one. May I?" He reached out a hoof.\n\nWincing, Twilight wriggled a couple of inches back. "S-Sorry, Gen—Caltrop, but no." She bit her lip. "You're right, I could have, but I was drained. I-I'm sorry, but I—" After a couple of seconds, her voice hitched and she sniffled. "I-I don't want to—What Daybreaker did and—"\n\n"How did you escape?"\n\nTwilight's smile got slightly wider. She searched his expression, pleadingly. "I was being transferred to another cell. Where she had me before, it suppressed my magic, so they didn't need an inhibitor ring. When they brought me out, I, well, I—" She coughed and choked a bit. "So much blood..."\n\nNarrowing his eyes, Caltrop added as he glanced at her mane, "I can't help but notice the single stripe of red, Princess. Take up mane dying while in Daybreaker's dungeons?"\n\nTwilight looked up at her mane. When she returned to looking at Caltrop, she simply stated, "I didn't get out of there unscathed, Caltrop. She tried things on me. I—I don't want to repeat it all." She cringed back and shivered. "I-I just want it all to end..."\n\nExchanging looks with his scouts, Caltrop finally huffed, "And it'll end." He reached out a hoof and placed it on one of hers. When she opened an eye, he grinned. "We need to move further from here. Daybreaker won't let you go easily." At that, Twilight whinnied happily."

  solarreworked.454.d:0 ""I still think this is a horrible idea," Sunrise Sparkle heard one of the ponies ahead of her murmur. About half a dozen ponies, excluding herself, were slowly slinking up to the perimeter wall of one of the arsenal depots for the Empire. Although she had not been told where, and she had been blindfolded for extra insurance, she knew they had to have been outside the military base near Boring Hills. Nowhere else was as flat and dull.\n\nNo matter. It wasn't their time, yet.\n\n"You always think that any mission is a terrible idea," another pony hissed as they reached the wall.\n\n"Relying upon an untrusted asset? Really?"\n\n"I AM right here, you know," snarked Sunrise as her horn lit up with a dark magenta glow. There wasn't a risk with her around. Furrowing her brow, she exchanged glances between the two ponies, who both flinched at her statement. "While I understand General Decay's caution, and your hesitation, I assure you, if I was working Daybreaker, would I really go so far as to actively hurt her?" She tapped the wall. "Blowing this up will definitely hurt it."\n\n"You're right, Princess, but still..." The first speaker, a younger, unicorn mare with a curly mane, briefly checked Sunrise's flank. "Isn't it just, um, a bit odd that, you know, that your cutie mark is different?"\n\nSunrise glimpsed the furtive stares. Yes, of course that would arouse some suspicion. Unless going for a full disguise, altering one's cutie mark's appearance was impossible, save for incredibly strong magic, like that of the Empress. Or the Elements. So, to that end, she beamed wide. "As I told General Decay, I didn't come out unscathed." Folding her ears against her head, she grumbled, "Daybreaker w-wanted to do anything she could to break me. S-She could even make it so my cutie mark could—" She paused to think. "It just hurt a lot, okay? Anything with my special talent at all."\n\nFabrication. Complete lie. But certainly plausible. It was common knowledge the Empress was more powerful than she had been as Celestia.\n\nThe other rebel raised his eyebrows. "How'd she do that? Cutie marks are special."\n\nGroaning, Sunrise snapped, "I don't know! And I'm the good one at magic! She's evil! She probably cracked open the forbidden library sections—something I WISHED I could see at one time, but—" She paused. With a sheepish grin, she mumbled, "I'm rambling. I think we should continue with the mission?"\n\nWith a chorus of agreement, she lit her horn and started carefully slicing through the wall with her magic, before coughing purposefully and sending a surge of energy through her horn. It blew the wall through, and she tittered. "Woops, still don't quite have all my control back." She pulled out a stick of TNT. "Time to go in, magic blazing?""

Easy to scratch, yes, but not before probably sneezing. Which, of course, happened right before she could relieve the irritation. Both of the ponies traveling in front of her glanced back slightly in shock, then relaxed.\n\nPassing by a few other resistance members, Sunrise gave them nods before she marched into a larger room, filled with boxes and crates, as well as a single table that had a map spread around it. Caltrop Decay glanced up from where he was scrutinizing the sheet of paper. Sunrise trotted to the front of the group. She nodded.\n\n"Another success, Caltrop!" she reported with a chipper tone. Offering a textbook salute, she grinned. "We managed to steal about ten days' worth of fuel for the entire cell." She tilted her head. "Why do you need so much, anyway?"\n\nCaltrop pushed back. Although the lighting of the part storage room part war room was less than ideal, she could see that he was tired. Muted by the dimness, there were bags under his eyes, and he walked with a slump to his gait. "We're moving out, that's why." He sighed. "Surprise's cell has been wiped out."\n\nSunrise interjected with a gasp.\n\nBobbing his head, he replied, "I know, hard to believe. She was close, so we need to find a new base to avoid risk of entanglements with the Empire." After rubbing his chin, he sighed, "Thanks for getting that done." With a snort, he floated up another paper cutout of her cutie mark and stuck it to a corkboard with about three dozen others. "Another job done."\n\n"Yep! I—" A series of gunshots and shouts carried through room from outside. They all looked exchanged glances. "Go!" she finally ordered to the two ponies who worked on the last operation with her. "I'll make sure that Caltrop stays safe!"\n\nCaltrop smirked. "A Princess's word is law, stallions." When they took off, he sighed, "This was sooner than expected. You may have—"\n\n"Oh, I'll help all right," Sunrise replied as she clicked the door to the storage room shut. She crushed the handle, lock, and mechanism with her magic. "I'll help make this all go away." Her chest felt like an inferno roared in it. Sneering, she trotted toward Caltrop.\n\nFor his part, Caltrop kept his composure. Although, his voice quivered and gave himself away. "I should have guessed it was too ideal. Even the Princess of Friendship has fallen."\n\n"Oh, I'm still the Princess of Friendship." Tittering, Sunrise powered her horn, and two pistols appeared in a flash of magic. With a manic grin, she declared, "These are my friends: Elements and Harmony." She leveled them both at Caltrop. "I think they want to introduce themselves, too.""

  solarreworked.456.d:0 "River Swirl wrinkled her nose.\n\nWhile [RCT.GetNameDef] had a burgeoning air industry, and planes seemed to be filling more and more of [619.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s skies every week, that didn't mean that she appreciated the smell any further. As she disembarked from the twin-engined aircraft that she had been provided by the Royal Airforce, she coughed at the stench of jet fuel and exhaust. One of her retinue did, as well.\n\nThe tarmac itself was empty of other planes, since she had been slated for a private section of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s airport. About a hundred feet from the ramp leading down from the airplane, she spotted a couple of gold-plated ponies of the Royal Guard, as well as a taller, white alicorn standing between them.\n\nShe smiled.\n\nAs she bid a farewell to the stewardess and pilots of the plane, she trotted down the remaining steps of the ramp and cantered toward the small group of ponies. She bowed when she got within speaking distance. "Princess Celestia!" she proclaimed in lightly accented Ponish. "I didn't believe that I'd have the honor of—"\n\n"Please, Chancellor Swirl—May I call you River?—you mustn't act so humble." Princess Celestia stepped forward. For a brief moment, she reached out a hoof, as if to cup River's chin to pull it up, but she hesitated and tittered instead. "Apologies, I'm simply so used to my ponies that I forget sometimes..."\n\n"Forget?" River echoed, arching a brow as she rose from her bow.\n\n"Not everypony is under my protection. That is all." Celestia shivered. Briefly, her eyes flashed with something, but River couldn't quite tell what. Passion of some kind. She tore her gaze away after a couple of seconds. Gawking at the Princess would surely be seen as some kind of offense.\n\n"O-Oh, I understand. It probably doesn't help that I, er, studied here, years ago," she quipped after a brief pause. With a confident, if tired smile, she added, "I was going to say that I didn't expect to see or speak with you again after I left your school." She chuckled. "I suppose fate had other ideas?"\n\n"Mmm, quite," replied Celestia. Her expression soon rested at neutral. Whatever she was thinking was undetectable, despite River's years dealing with all sides of the political spectrum. Celestia swished her tail. Glancing back at her guards, she stated, "I do not wish to tarry and delay your itinerary. I understand that you're a busy mare." She winked. "Congratulations on the third term, by the way."\n\nEyes brightening, River fell in step with Celestia and nodded to her own retinue. "Thanks!" She beamed. "I do have one request, first, though."\n\nCelestia paused and stared at her. "Oh? I'm all ears.""

  solarreworked.457.d:0 "It hadn't changed a bit.\n\nAs River Swirl and Princess Celestia stepped through the grandiose, purple-adorned marble archway to Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, River could only blink back a few tears as images of her time in different classrooms and hallways flashed in her mind. She wiped at her eyes a couple of times and Celestia bent her head to whisper to her, "Need a moment?"\n\nRiver shook her head. "No, I'm fine," she answered with a sniffle. "Just recalling some of the friendships I had to let go when I departed." With that, she pulled her robe slightly tighter and glanced to Celestia. "I didn't come here to lollygag, Princess. I wished to speak with one of my old professors." Celestia's eyes sparkled. Although faint, a playful smile built almost imperceptibly on her muzzle. From that surely practiced display of regal curiosity, River's heart skipped a couple of beats.\n\n"Who might that be, Chancellor Swirl?"\n\n"Please, River." River bit her lip. "I realize I didn't tell you that—" Cutting herself off, she shook her head. "Sorry. I'm a little, how do you say, frazzled?" She pressed a hoof against her mouth as she suppressed a yawn.\n\n"Happens when you travel halfway around the world," tittered Celestia. Briefly bowing her head, she stated, "But very well. We have no need for titles among friends. Who are you wishing to see, River?"\n\nAt Celestia's declaration, River's chest lightened a tad. Friend of Celestia? Surely it was just a formality. Either way, she pushed the giddy sensation down and declared as she started walking down one of the hallways, "Professor Orator. He still has tenure here?"\n\n"As far as I'm aware," came the reply.\n\nFurrowing her brow, River strode ahead, her hooves beating heavily on the marbled floors as she passed a few students, who glanced at her and then gawked at Celestia, who was bringing up the rear. Although the decorations had modernized and changed, she still easily visualized the corridor layout of the school. Within moments, she stood outside a door, Orator's name emblazoned on the frosted glass.\n\nShe knocked.\n\nAfter a couple of seconds, a familiar, if shakier stallion's voice proclaimed, "It's unlocked." She breathed in and opened the door. When she entered, the stallion looked up and he let out a small gasp. "River Swirl?" He sprang to his hooves and galloped up to her.\n\n"Yes, stari." River shrugged. "I'm back!" With a giddy smile, she glanced down at her robes. "And, well, you said I could do it..."\n\n"That I did." He sighed. "I did hear you were re-elected, actually." His brown eyes burned as he quipped, "I hope that you'll be able to work things out on the poverty front." Shaking his head, he muttered, "Nasty business."\n\n"Me, too." River lit her horn, and a small statue of the Republic's palace appeared. Before she could continue, though, she spotted a bust behind him. A bust of Caramel Marks. River coughed, then continued, unabated."

  solarreworked.458.d:0 ""...and then she actually switched our cutie marks. Can you believe that? She just—" Princess Celestia made a quick popping noise with her lips "—poofed them like that!" With a small titter, she shook her head and nibbled on a pastry. River Swirl, likewise, took the break in the conversation to quickly, but daintily, gulp down a bit of her wine. She hadn't had this particular type since she last was in Equestria, well before the invasion of 1002.\n\n"It is, erm, certainly the tale!" she declared when Celestia continued to bite down on her meal. Radiant sunlight poured in through the tall windows of the dining hall, with only a few castle servants and guards milling around to ensure their safety and privacy. Through the glass, River darted her eyes as she trailed a few specks in the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] move through the city.\n\n"Yes, it was quite enlightening!" Celestia quipped.\n\nShe grimaced. Swirling the half-drunk wine in her goblet, she glanced back at Celestia. Briefly gazing into her reflection, she finally muttered, "I hate to bring up politics while eating, but—"\n\nCelestia held up a hoof. After she finished her bite, she shook her head and quipped, "It's all right. I understand. Nervous?" When River bobbed her head after hemming and hawing, Celestia smirked faintly. In a reassuring tone, she leaned forward a bit from her end of the table and declared, "Don't be. I understand this visa program is important, but we both want to build our nations' friendship as two bright beacons of Harmony. I'll ensure that both are satisfied with the end result."\n\n"And what if there are ponies who aren't?"\n\nNarrowing her eyes, Celestia sternly declared, "There will always be naysayers." She firmly pressed a hoof on the table. "I WILL make sure this benefits all our ponies." River could only sigh.\n\nCelestia tilted her head. "Is something matter, River? You seem... on edge."\n\nBriefly, River squirmed and then grunted, "Well, when you are stuck wondering when those naysayers will complain about you, stymie you, and slander you, perhaps you'll share some of my unease." She went back to eating her salad.\n\n"Oh? Anypony in particular?" Celestia's eyes twinkled. "I've been told I'm quite therapeutic to talk to. Don't worry. This stays between us." At that, she nodded to her staff, who hastily departed. She steepled her hooves together and gazed at River from her seat.\n\nRiver scrunched her muzzle. After a few seconds, she finally snarled, "Nova Whirl. That's her name! She and her socialists, they—" She cut herself off with a groan. "I even fantasized about stabbing her with a pen during a debate! Me! I-I don't know what comes over me around her. Her party refuses to work with me!" Inhaling deeply, she hung her head. "Forgive my outburst, but her party leaves me with no small amount of stress."\n\nCelestia blinked. "Maybe that was a bit TOO honest.""

  solarreworked.459.d:0 ""I'll say it again, Princess: it was an honor to speak to you face-to-face." Celestia politely smiled as River Swirl bowed her head. As she did, a gust of wind on the runway of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s airport whipped at her robes and made her cringe away at the force of the gale. Likewise, Celestia braced herself and held a hoof out to keep Raven steady beside her.\n\n"Of course, River. It was my pleasure." In the same deferential motion, she lowered her head. She didn't raise it, though. Instead, she stared at River, and her grin turned into a knowing smirk. "And I'm sure being a sounding board for your... frustrations was appreciated, too."\n\nWith a nervous flinched, River tittered with an awkward cough and scratched at the back of her head. "Y-Yes, of course. I mustn't forget your wise words." She cleared her throat. "Giving into, er, base desires of stabbing ponies: not good for appearances." Brushing a hoof on the tarmac of the runway, she blushed and grumbled, "This will remain between us, I hope?"\n\n"Yes, but, who's to say that it can't be a point to giggle at between friends, hmm?" Arching an eyebrow while keeping a playful smirk on her muzzle, Celestia peeled away and sighed before she added, "Keep well, River. I believe that our discussions about the treaty have been beneficial for both our ponies." She thrust forward a forehoof. For a second, River peered at it, then she met it with a soft bump of one of her own forehooves. Celestia tittered.\n\n"To our ponies' future, Princess," River declared.\n\n"To our ponies' future," echoed Celestia as she stepped back. "And, please, Celestia is fine." River's eyes brightened and she flashed a toothy grin. As she twirled to march toward the private plane, Celestia briefly waved farewell, then watched impassively. River reached the ascent of the staircase, turned, gave Celestia a final nod, then disappeared into the plane. When the door was shut, Celestia sighed.\n\n"Tiring, Princess?" inquired Raven once the plane started to taxi for takeoff.\n\nWith River no longer able to see her, Celestia shivered and then quipped, "Yes, you could say that, Raven." She caught Raven check something off her clipboard. "The ponies of the East are certainly... different."\n\n"Mmm, from what I heard, a bit more violent." Raven readjusted her spectacles.\n\n"Yes, that fits." Glancing over at her assistant, Celestia inquired, "What's next on my schedule, Raven?"\n\nScrutinizing it momentarily, Raven hummed and answered with a slightly confused tone, "'Therapy visit with Starlight Glimmer?'"\n\n"Oh, that's today? I forgot she made room for me on such short notice." Clicking her tongue, Celestia quipped, "Well, let's see if her empathy cocoa works miracles like I've heard." Before Raven could reply with anything, Celestia powered her horn and disappeared in a burst of golden magic."

  solarreworked.460.d:0 "River Swirl's head throbbed. Every bone in her body ached, and she tiredly rose up as the ear-splitting screech of metal on stonework shot through her skull. Groaning, she flattened her ears against her head and shivered. Oh, for the days that a slightly damp room wouldn't leave her feeling like she had been dunked underneath an ice sheet.\n\nAt first, the corridor outside her jail cell remained dark and dingy, then an orange glow began to highlight the bricks. Instantly, River furrowed her brow and straightened her posture. A few of the prisoners in other cells stirred at the noise as well, and she held back a small gulp at seeing some of their sorry, emaciated appearances. She could guess that she was in Canterlot, given the period of unconsciousness.\n\nIt didn't take much more to figure out who had taken her. Doubly so as said pony appeared in front of her bars. River bared her teeth at Daybreaker, who was gazing giddily at her. With a glib titter, Daybreaker stated, "Comfortable, River? I will admit, a bit low-class to our other visits, but what can you do?" She shrugged. "Budget cuts."\n\n"If you want to kill me, monster, kill me. I will not beg for you!" River jutted her chin upward and snorted in frustration. Although her mane had faded and greyed with her time in office, it was still as lengthy as ever. Part of it flopped over her face.\n\nDaybreaker snickered. "Kill you? Where's the fun in that?" Pressing her hooves against the bars of River's cell, she bared her fangs. Her eyes, like burning candles, pierced River's soul. "If this was when we first chatted politics years ago over dinner, maybe I'd enlighten you." She rolled her shoulders. "But, now that'd only dilute the importance of my other chosen. You had a lot of promise, River."\n\nRiver scoffed. "I'll always stand by Harmony, even when you don't!"\n\nBlinking for a moment, Daybreaker finally cackled and pushed herself back. "Do you now?" She grinned. "I didn't come here for a social chat. I have a little... gift." As she finished, a swirling field of blood-red magic appeared around her horn, and an older mare with a short ponytail and familiar, dull, grey-blue coat materialized in a flash.\n\nRiver gasped. Daybreaker sneered.\n\n"Nova Whirl?!"\n\nDaybreaker examined Nova like she was a recently killed prey. "My troops found her organizing 'resistance' in one of your little towns." She huffed. "How foalish." Opening River's cell door, Daybreaker tossed Nova in, who skidded to a halt near River's hooves. A second later, something clattered onto the ground beside her. A fountain pen.\n\nShaking, River gazed, in shock, at Daybreaker. Daybreaker spun on her heels. "She's quite chatty, I've been told. But... I think you know what to do." She cackled. "Unless you want to hear her lies until the end of time!""

  solarreworked.461.d:0 ""Cooooooool!"\n\nAt the young stallion's prolonged, nasally exclamation at seeing the standard weaponry that all he and his fellow recruits would be using for training, Sergeant Mud Pit inwardly screamed. Furthermore, a part of him died, somewhere, in what was left of his heart, at the absolutely stupid propellor hat that was resting on one of the stallion's ears.\n\nDid he have to wear—in the loosest definition of the word—that absurd thing?\n\nInhaling deeply, Mud Pit was about to speak before the deep brown stallion raised his hoof. All his fellow recruits gaped at him. He waggled the offending hoof.\n\nMud Pit pursed his lips. When the stallion—barely more than a colt, really—kept his hoof raised, and then started to grunt and groan as he wriggled and jittered in place, Mud Pit finally snapped, "You got something to say, Private?!"\n\n"Oh! That's just like this one radio show where—" The young stallion cut himself off as he looked around at the irritated crowd observing him. With a small chuckle, he muttered, "Woops, sorry." Almost immediately he perked back up and inquired, "Do we get to shoot that? Will it just be like my friends' re-enactment games we play every—"\n\n"Private—"\n\n"Button Mash, reporting for duty, sir!"\n\nMud Pit gnashed his teeth. As a couple of veins popped out on his chin and bulged along his neck, Mud Pit's face turned a beet red and he bellowed, "I am not a SIR! I work for a living, you moron!"\n\nButton Mash flinched back. Sniffling a couple of times, he mumbled and wiped at his nose, "You didn't need to be so nasty about it." One of Mud Pit's eyelids twitched at the comment. While clearly affected, Button didn't appear phased or broken.\n\nThere was going to be a long road ahead of Mud Pit if he couldn't get through to the moron. However, he reminded himself, let it never be said that he couldn't whip up the softest civilian into a fighting machine for the Empress. As he breathed in, he inquired, in an icy tone so frigid, it'd freeze even Daybreaker's mane, "What's your question, Private?"\n\n"Button Mash."\n\n"Private Smash." Mud Pit grinned tauntingly. "I'm here to serve, obviously."\n\nBlinking for a moment, Button finally blurted out, "I really have to use the bathroom and can I also try out that Lila Rifle over there it looks like it might need a bit of cleaning first and I think that maybe it's missing its magazine and—" He squealed when Mud Pit glowered at him.\n\nSneering, Mud Pit grabbed the rifle Button pointed out and checked it. Perfectly working. No bullet, though. He snickered. "Sure, Private. You can go tinkle." He passed the gun to Button. "After you prove you know your guns." He pointed at a target. "Hit it."\n\nButton arched a brow, then readied the gun. While he unsteadily stood ready to fire, he pulled the trigger. There was a click. He glanced at the receiver and muttered, "Huh." Then the gun exploded. Mud Pit blinked in shock. That wasn't supposed to happen.\n\nButton coughed once, his face sooty. "Coooooooooooool..." He fell onto his back, out cold."

The words froze on her tongue. Not only was she woefully unprepared to fill in for Rarity, who had recently disappeared, but every single student that was in that room gazed at her, worry painted on their faces.\n\nThere had been no news of what was going to happen to the School of Friendship with the "ascension" of Daybreaker Sun. Only a few weeks had even passed since Luna had vanished after going to [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Shortly after Rarity had disappeared, so had Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon. All they had left was the schedules that Twilight had left shortly before her sudden absence.\n\nAs her chest tightened, she brushed back some of her blue mane and grinned as best she could. "Shall we begin, class?" she inquired. Almost complete silence answered her in return. With an awkward titter, she clopped her front hooves together and then glanced down at the notes she had with her. Thankfully, Rarity had left at least a few things for her next few lessons.\n\nBesides, being in the service industry, treating ponies generously came naturally.\n\n"Prod discussion with pointed question about balancing one's health with those in need," one of the scribbled points read. She smiled again. That'd not be hard.\n\nAs she was about to inquire of one of the yak students there, there was a sudden scream from the hallway outside the classroom. Jumping to her hooves, Aloe gasped when the door burst open and a number of armed ponies entered. "Everypony out, now!" the first one that came in demanded.\n\n"W-What's happening?!" Aloe demanded, a sudden fire burning inside her. She caught a few of the students shuddering behind their desks. "You barge in here like you own the place! We are just teacher and students! We have done nothing!"\n\n"I won't repeat myself," the solder snarled and she heard a few clicks of safeties being removed from the rifles the squad held.\n\nFor a few seconds, she stared them down, then she swallowed. Hanging her head, she muttered, "Follow them, class. I-It won't be long."\n\nAs they left, Aloe caught the other classes being emptied in much the same manner. Over one of the doors, a poster of sun being embraced by wings was plastered on a wall. She gulped. Simple words were on it.\n\n"By order of Empress Daybreaker, this site is condemned as a den of Anti-Harmony propaganda.

Pinkish hues of sunlight from the early morning sunrise splattered against the pages, rendering a few of the items illegible from the glare. She furrowed her brow and turned away from Princess Celestia's chamber doors.\n\nIt had been rather quiet in Canterlot, she had to admit. Almost like a switch had been flipped. Given that she had been in meetings for most of the afternoon and then went straight to bed—as the early bird got the worm, after all—whatever had caused the nervousness that had settled on the city remained a mystery. At least for the moment. Probably once the Princess was ready for the day, she'd hear about what had happened.\n\nShe sighed and finished flipping through the schedule. More war room planning in the morning. If Celestia spent much more time in those, she'd have a proper nervous breakdown, that much was certain. As Raven glanced back at the chamber doors, she suppressed a quiver of her lips.\n\nCelestia was doing her best. But her care for everypony...\n\nRaven cut her thoughts off and huffed. Keeping her back to the door, she scribbled a note down on one of the pages of the schedule, and finally caught them opening. Seconds later, heavy hoofbeats tramped up next to her, and she heard Celestia state coolly, "Good morning, Raven."\n\n"Princess." Raven performed a quick bow and spun on her hooves. "I trust that yesterday went—" With a yelp, her words died on her tongue as she took in Celestia. Was it Celestia? The alicorn in front of her was on fire, almost literally. Flames licked from the base of her head and tail's dock to the floor, and she carried herself confidently.\n\nRaven traced her eyes to the mare's cutie mark, and swallowed. A raging sun. Yet still a sun.\n\n"Oh, I might have forgotten to mention I have a new look." The alicorn spoke with Celestia's voice. With a small twirl, she flashed Raven a grin and inquired, "What do you think? Vibes much more with being the alicorn of the sun, don't you agree?"\n\nWithout waiting for an answer from Raven, Celestia trotted past and held her head high. "Come, Raven! I've a war to win.

Her mane's stars were bouncing around its inky blue expanse, appearing like chaotic, streaking points of light.\n\n"Come in, then," Raven replied with a straightforward gesture of a hoof. With a small snort, she turned her attention back to her papers and quipped, "You're one of the Princesses, you don't need permission to barge in on me." Lowering her voice to almost a whisper, she snarked, "I'm paid to be interrupted."\n\nLuna ruffled her wings. Briefly leaning back to peer out the doorway, she checked both sides of the hall and then nodded. She lit her horn, and the door glowed a cobalt blue before it shut behind her. She clicked the lock tight.\n\n"Raven, before I begin, I must request of you utmost confidentiality." Evenly staring at her, Luna furrowed her brow and marched up to Raven's desk. For a second or two, she stood resolutely, then at Raven's inviting glance, pulled up a chair on which to sit. She gazed directly into Raven's soul. "This is about my sister. I'm... concerned for 'Tia."\n\nRaven's lips quirked at the affectionate nickname. Heaving a sigh, she sat up from her work and floated over a small bottle of cider. When Luna declined any, she shrugged and poured a shot for herself, which she downed almost instantly. For whatever reason, she believed she needed it.\n\nAs the minutes passed, Luna squirmed in her seat and frowned out the window of the office. Twin planters on either side provided some décor to an otherwise spartan room. Luna simply looked at the sun.\n\n"I know not how best to voice my fears, Raven, but I have observed... changes in 'Tia." Luna pressed her tongue against a cheek. Momentarily quieting, she scraped a hoof against the edge of her seat. Flicking an ear, she grunted, "She is different. Flighty. Anxious. Were I so bold, I'd declare her paranoid. She has become engulfed by this war, and I fear..."\n\nLuna shivered. "I fear that she shan't return when it concludes." Almost imperceptibly, Raven caught a couple of tears trickle down Luna's muzzle. Luna sniffled.\n\n"I pray, Raven, that you also have seen these alterations? Do they concern you as much as they worry me?"\n\nSlipping from her seat, Raven trotted over to Luna and exhaled tiredly. "It's just stress, Princess."

When he remained face-first, buried in the carpet that led up to her throne, she finally permitted herself a shred of indignity and wrinkled her nose.\n\n"Get up," she ordered, which was what he did immediately.\n\n"Of course, Goddess C—Daybreaker. Of course."\n\nFlattening her ears against her head, she huffed at the fire-scratched voice he carried. All she saw in his eyes was passion, pure, unadulterated energy ready to be unleashed. It was simply such a shame that she'd to have him executed.\n\nCalmly rising from her throne, she cantered down the dais on which it sat, each motion steady and even, measured to provide the maximum amount of weight, and to make him wriggle just a little more. Of course, he, like her, provided no reaction to read, but that didn't mean she was ignorant of his emotions and feelings.\n\nNor was she uninformed.\n\n"Tell me, Good Word, did you believe that you were following my orders and commands when your lodge spread like a cancer through the South-East?"

For the briefest moment, it turned a hot blue before returning to its normal orange.\n\n"Of course, Goddess." Good Word bowed low, effectively prostrate, as he answered her.

Immediately he complied.\n\n"Are you so naive to believe that the Lunarists would all convert by sword alone?" Staring deep into his eyes, she bared her teeth. "I tolerated your heresy because you kept the land at peace, but now I see what you were truly doing."\n\n"I was only doing it for—"\n\n"Enough!" Grabbing him by his jacket and constricting his lungs with magic alone, she hauled him close and snarled, "The Lunarists have played you for a fool and remained loyal to the moon, while you have sullied my name and brought hatred to the Sun in the South-East. My priestesses and inquisitors now must work THRICE as hard to make all see me for who I am. And you..." She pulled back, a coy smirk on her face. "You will taste the fires that you love so much."\n\nShe briefly flashed her horn. Flames leapt from his hooves and engulfed Good Word's body. Yet through it all, he remained silent, penitent.\n\n"Now, young stallion, you will burn.""

  ###Luna-Elements Events###
  solarreworked.150.t:0 "Princess-a-Princess"
  solarreworked.150.d:0 ""Princess Luna!" Twilight Sparkle exclaimed as Spike announced their guest. Instantly hopping off of her desk which she had set up in her library since her friends had left to assist with the war effort, she galloped over to the princess and wrapped her wings around Luna in a strong hug. She pulled back. Luna was tense enough that she could SNAP at the slightest nudge. Arching a brow, Twilight asked, "What's wrong?"\n\nMomentarily, Luna visually appraised Twilight before stepping further into the room. "May we speak privately?" she inquired, motioning with her eyes toward Spike, who was taking a few signed letters from Twilight's desk and putting them onto a different stack. He sighed when he was done, and looked up at the towering structure of paper that was still waiting for him.\n\n"We are private," Twilight stated as she checked behind her at Spike.\n\n"Without your young drake," Luna firmly emphasized. She stomped lightly on the floor.\n\nBiting her lip, Twilight glanced back at Spike, caught his attention, and indicated for him to leave. Spike shot a puzzled look between Luna and Twilight, but nodded and hastily departed. As the door clicked shut behind Luna, she grumpily prodded, "What have you recently heard from Canterlot?"\n\nTwilight scratched her chin. "Nothing. Why?"\n\n"Exactly." Her face gloomy, Luna looked out of one of the high windows outside. Twilight followed her. Just barely, the spires of the capital could be discerned. Twilight's mind was still racing, and she gave a small, confused grunt. Exhaling, Luna returned her attention to Twilight. "I am going to Canterlot. My sister has been disturbingly quiet, and I truly fear something ill has befallen her."\n\n"But—"\n\nLuna held up a hoof. "It is more than stress, young Twilight. There's something else ahoof. All I have received on the front have been short missives from the High Command." Scrunching her face in disgust, she growled, "And they are polar opposite of what has been requested of me nary a week before. Were it not that I had final say of my soldiers' orders, the world would think we were criminals."\n\n"What?!" Twilight gasped, her eyes going wide. "You can't think that—"\n\n"I know not what to believe, Twilight," Luna interrupted. Spinning to the door, she began to march toward it and paused. Without looking back, she stated, "Summon your friends. I will seek my sister." She swallowed. "I trust that you will know what to do to preserve Harmony.""
  solarreworked.150.a:0 "I currently hold a low view on the outcome of these events."
  solarreworked.151.t:0 "A New Canterlot"
  solarreworked.151.d:0 "Ponies parted the street as Luna practically sailed through them, her mane billowing in the wind. Twisted into a furious scowl, her face practically begged any who saw her to challenge her on her path through Canterlot. She was not able to simply teleport there like she believed. Something magical, something powerful, was blocking her. Anti-teleportation fields were infrequent before her banishment, and very few mages were ever powerful enough to stop an alicorn.\n\nHer gut swirled and lurched. Bile occasionally threatened to breach her throat, but through sheer anger and force, she managed to keep from giving in to her escalating fear. However, it did nothing for her guilt.\n\nAlthough there were many ponies who greeted her with relief when they saw her on her march through the city, she encountered others who jeered, filled with a hatred she had not seen for a millennia. And then there were the patrols. Some of the friendlies she had encountered vanished at sign of soldiers.\n\nSome of the monuments she had helped oversee before her banishment were cordoned off, and posters encouraging ponies to stand strong for Harmony had had graffiti sprayed over them. Every street she passed, something new caused her stomach to constrict.\n\nYet soon, she was within the shadow of Canterlot Castle, and she stood outside the gate. Only a single soldier was standing between her and the castle, and he was quaking at her palpable rage. Slowly, she snarled, "Allow me entrance."\n\nHe nodded. She spotted his uniform. A pure white, with brilliant golden highlights. Certainly not standard Equestrian issue.\n\nWhen she was finally given entrance, she stalked off without a word. Not a single pony stopped her in her traversing of the castle, despite the other soldiers she noticed and the numerous staff. All were arranged in new uniforms that were wholly unlike the humble displays of her officers on the front.\n\nIt didn't take long for her to arrive at Celestia's chambers, and she didn't bother knocking. "Celestia. We must speak," she flatly declared as she entered. She snorted. Miraculously, Celestia was no longer glued to her desk like she had been last time. "To where could you have vanished?" she murmured to herself.\n\nAs she turned, she stopped when she saw two guards shakily aiming at her with rifles. She shot them a doubtful look. "You are serious?" She smiled, menacingly. "Might I suggest you bring me to Celestia? I would have a word with her.""
  solarreworked.151.a:0 "I have a horrible premonition about this."
  solarreworked.152.t:0 "Sister Dearest"
  solarreworked.152.d:0 ""We're sorry, Princess," one of Luna's escorts murmured under his breath as he and his comrade directed her toward the throne room.\n\n"Nay, it is I for which I have much to apologize," Luna replied instantly. As she and the two soldiers had walked through the castle, her heart had sunk, to a point somewhere deep in her gullet. Along the way, she had seen servants in the middle of unfurling great flags of brilliant orange and a sun with wings embracing it. Gone were the symbols of Equestria, in were... something.\n\nShaking her head, she dismissed the guards and threw open the doors to the throne room. Immediately her breath was snatched from her as waves of heat washed past her. She coughed for a moment, taking in the twin falls of lava that descended from the back of the space, creating moats around the dais and the path up to it.\n\nSitting upon the throne where she speaking with a pair of uniformed officers, Celestia sat. Whatever befell Luna's sister, she was a twisted monster of orange fire. The being looked at her when she entered, and bellowed a cackle.\n\n"Why, dearest Luna, how lovely for you to visit!" Daybreaker stated as Luna entered Canterlot Castle's throne room and was nearly floored by the heat coming from twin falls of lava on either side of the dais. Although she was a bit off guard, Daybreaker still sneered. A bit early, but planned for, nonetheless. She gave a small twirl. "What do you think? Do I not look positively steamy?"\n\n"What. Have. You. Done?!" Luna finally snapped. Sparks flew from her horn. A wind built and a low whining formed around her magic's field. Spreading her forelegs, Luna snarled. "Celestia. What. Did. You. DO?!"\n\nTittering, Daybreaker sashayed back to her throne and sat down. She smirked. "I don't expect you to understand, little Lulu." When she saw Luna's magic still charging, she bellowed a laugh. "What? You think you can stop me?!" As an answer, a beam of pure cobalt blue energy flew from Luna's horn toward her.\n\nDaybreaker yawned. A field of blood red fire sprang up in front of her, deflecting the bolt easily. "Was that your plan?" she inquired. "You can't kill Daybreaker Sun so easily!"\n\n"I know not what has possessed you, Sister, but I will not allow it!" Luna started to march toward the throne. "Mayhap I shall fall, but Twilight—"\n\n"Oh, please!" Daybreaker stuck out her tongue. "You think that she could succeed? Ha! Not when I hold the Elements, dearest Luna." With a mocking purse of her lips, Daybreaker rubbed a hoof on her peytral and looked at it. "I would explain everything to you, but I'm sure you'd just try and shoot me again." She chuckled. "So, how about we cut to the chase, hmm?"\n\nWithout warning, she summoned a bolt of fire from one of the flows of lava. Luna yelped and dodged, but stumbled backward. She barely absorbed a second shot. Before she could stand properly, a third hurled toward her, then a fourth. Each one pushed her further back, toward the entrance, and she strained as she felt a tension build in her horn. The amount of energy must have been on the level of when she gave into Nightmare Moon.\n\nWhen she had deflected one more bolt, she spotted a pause, and leapt at it. Flinging the door open, she bolted from the throne room, tears stinging her eyes. As Daybreaker watched her, she could only think of one thing: she had failed her sister."
  solarreworked.152.a:0 "I have a bad feeling about this."
  solarreworked.153.t:0 "Eclipse of the Heart"
  solarreworked.153.d:0 "We have just received word from the search parties that have been dispatched throughout the city. Princess Luna has escaped.\n\nAlthough there was contact with her, a few squads of soldiers is not enough to properly combat an alicorn. Delta and Theta squads were quickly pinned down as she was herded by Beta and Zeta toward a planned interception and capture point, as planned in case she confronted the Empress in the castle like she believed. However, instead of allowing herself to be cornered, Princess Luna first aimed to take to the skies, and when she was nearly tackled by some of our pegasus units, she instead blew a hole directly through one of the new construction projects in Salvation Plaza.\n\nThis was unexpected behavior. No squads were on the other side of the square at the time, as the buildings were considered secure. Before they could regroup, all units lost track of the princess.\n\nIntelligence is unsure of where she could flee. Ponyville is under our control, but Twilight Sparkle has disappeared after initial contact.\n\nWe could expend more resources to search for all of them, but with the limited control over the country that the Crown currently possesses, it could prove futile."
  solarreworked.153.a:0 "Let her run. She's a broken mare, anyway."
  solarreworked.153.b:0 "I wonder where she could have gone?"
  solarreworked.154.t:0 "Betrayal"
  solarreworked.154.d:0 "Princess Luna took to the airwaves today, calling upon all ponies still loyal to the ideals of Harmony and to her and Celestia's legacy to take up arms against us! This broadcast was unable to be blocked in time, as a number of repeaters from the East Coast were used to spread it across the country with little delay. So far, we have not pinpointed the location from which it was transmitted.\n\nOur already tenuous control over that region has been shattered. Fillydelphia and Manehattan both announced their secession to follow after the "true Equestria" and there are concerns that other regions may see this as an opportunity to follow their own independent movements.\n\nAt least a third of our military has deserted, and militia groups are supposedly rising up in support of Luna as well.\n\nNo amount of cracking down upon dissent will stem the tide of revulsion that many of our ponies feel toward the Empress. Although we stand for true Harmony and Order, we have been betrayed by some of our very own. Almost immediately after the broadcast from Luna was jammed, our Empress held a speech condemning her and all that followed her as seeking to topple us from within and provide an opportunity for those who would see Harmony snuffed out.\n\nThere are already reports of fighting breaking out in loyal towns and cities. Across the country, riots have also sprung up, and there are indications of a clandestine resistance group that is coordinating with the false government to destroy us!\n\nWe cannot stand for this! All who can fight must fight! The Solar War has begun!"
  solarreworked.154.a:0 "Luna can try..."
  solarreworked.154.b:0 "We must fight against Daybreaker's tyranny!"
  solarreworked.155.t:0 "An Aunt's Request"
  solarreworked.155.d:0 ""Princess Luna to see you, Princess," Flash Sentry announced proudly as he opened the door to [CRY.GetNameDef]'s throne room and allowed the alicorn entrance. As soon as Cadance saw Luna, she gasped and hopped off her throne to gallop toward her aunt. Before Flash could bid both of them farewell, Cadance effectively crashed into Luna and enveloped her in a tight wing hug.\n\n"Auntie Luna!" exclaimed Cadance, her voice dripping with worry as she released Luna and gazed into her aunt's eyes. She didn't need to ask if Luna was okay. Luna wasn't.\n\nSweat drenched Luna's fur. Long gashes along her fur indicated she had run through at least one thicket, and her horn occasionally sparked and sputtered. Barely visible was a hairline crack that had formed in it. When Cadance spotted it, she whimpered softly and guided Luna toward Shining's throne, who was actively leading from the front against [CRY.GetNameDef]'s and [EQS.GetNameDef]'s foes.\n\nWhen Luna finally caught her breath after being sat upon his throne, she closed her eyes and leaned back against the headrest. At last, she choked out, "You must help me, Cadance." With a couple of wheezes, she groaned, "Equestria has fallen. From the inside."\n\n"What?" Cadance blurted, unfurling her wings in shock. "B-But we're still—"\n\n"Celestia. She has become twisted. Lost." Luna swallowed again. With a flickering field of magic, she summoned a glass of water and guzzled it. "I have used my vigor to flee here on hoof. I cannot trust the safety of Equestria's roads or trains."\n\n"What do you mean?"\n\n"I am being hunted." With some water in her, Luna began to relax. Cadance noticed deep, dark circles under her aunt's eyes. "Celestia—DAYBREAKER—wishes me for some foul purpose. She has already enslaved my ponies, even if they know it not yet." At that, Cadance's heart sunk. Luna peered at her imploringly. Perhaps for the first time in Cadance's memory, Luna looked to be begging.\n\n"Please," she stuttered, "you must come to my aid. We must stop Daybreaker before she destroys my ponies' lives!"\n\nA lump building in her throat, Cadance whimpered, "And what of my ponies' lives if I fight her? Equestria is more industrialized and has more ponies. If we get into a hot war..." Cadance grimaced. Although every ounce of her being protested, she finally stuttered, "I-I can't right now, Auntie. Not until we can be prepared." She sniffed. "I'm sorry."\n\nLuna's reaction told it all."
  solarreworked.155.a:0 "We can only offer you a home."
  solarreworked.156.t:0 "Strategic Redeployment"
  solarreworked.156.d_a:0 ""Twilight! I got here as soon as I got your telegram!" Applejack declared as she burst through the doors of Twilight's castle. She blinked away sweat, which soaked her uniform, and glanced around at the ponies assembled in the foyer of the castle. Aside from the already addressed Twilight, the rest of Applejack's friends were assembled, plus Spike. All of them had belongings packed. Pushing up her hat, she wiped her mane and asked, "What's going on? Your letter was more frantic than a hog in heat!"\n\n"That's an image we wanted to visualize, Applejack," Rarity stated with a huff.\n\n"It's not actually that frantic," Fluttershy began before Rarity shot her a miffed expression. With a small sigh, Fluttershy shook her head and muttered, "Sorry, I'm not helping."\n\n"Thanks for getting here, Applejack," Twilight replied with a small gesture for the others to cut out their chatter. Spinning around once, she smiled and Applejack caught a couple of tears in Twilight's eyes before she added with a quivering voice, "Thank you, everypony, for coming so quickly."\n\n"Yeah, well, it sounded like you were in trouble, so, you know, wasn't hard to convince Spitfire to let me take a couple days' leave," Rainbow Dash interjected as she lazily floated above the others. "But geez, Twi, why'd you have to boss us into packing the kitchen sink?" She peered down at the number of suitcases that Rarity alone had packed. "You gave Rares an excuse."\n\n"Hmmph!" Rarity snorted. "I do NOT need an excuse for proper travel." Grimacing and fiddling with her mane, she added, "Besides, Fluttershy and I had a DREADFUL time getting out of Canterlot." Fluttershy nodded her agreement.\n\n"What in tarnation is going on?!" Applejack demanded, stomping a bit closer to Twilight. "Ya'll call us here when we could be helping out on the front! Ya'll know I don't like secrets!" She paused when Twilight frowned. Twilight almost never frowned.\n\n"Luna was here." For a moment, Twilight let the silence build and then sighed. "She was going to Canterlot. Something is wrong. Seriously wrong. She warned me if anything were to happen to her—and I think something has—I needed to find a way to keep the hope of Harmony alive." When her friends remained quiet, she swallowed and stuttered, "And I think that time has come. I've not heard from her, and—well, Rarity and Fluttershy can attest that things aren't good."\n\n"That's cool, Twi," Pinkie Pie interjected from the window she was looking out of, "but I think we have company." She sighed and pushed her flattened mane out of her face.\n\nGasping and rushing to the window, Twilight peered out and Applejack followed. At least thirty soldiers were marching toward the castle, causing Applejack's heart to leap into her throat. When Twilight pulled back, she whimpered, "We don't have time. Just trust me!" With that, she powered her horn, and each of them were swallowed in a field of magic, before disappearing with a soft pop."

At odd looks her friends gave her, she flared her nostrils and snorted. "She and I have been in constant communication since this war started. The last letter she sent was, well, it was disconcerting." She checked herself. "No, it was DISTURBING. She was raving about whispers at night, courtiers going behind her back, generals defying her. She wasn't herself. She never responded to me. I haven't been able to check on her because of my duties here and—" She inhaled. "Something is wrong. Seriously wrong. I don't want to run, but I think we need more than just us to solve this, and Cadance has offered—"\n\n"That's cool, Twi," Pinkie Pie interjected from the window she was looking out of, "but I think we have company."

  solarreworked.157.t:0 "Through the Countryside"
  solarreworked.157.d:0 ""Get down!" Rainbow Dash hissed as she dove to the brush and pulled both Pinkie Pie and Rarity with her. Flattening her ears against her head, she bit her tongue as Rarity let out her usual, ladylike shriek. Before Rarity could protest about being stallion-handled, Dash cupped a hoof over her muzzle. She shushed Rarity.\n\nIn seconds, she caught the rustle of leaves as Applejack, Twilight, and Fluttershy all took their own hiding places. Finally releasing Rarity's mouth, Dash whispered, "I saw movement." That managed to cut Rarity's anger short. Although her appearance was now properly disheveled, she gave Dash an appreciative nod.\n\nDash almost jumped when the leaves crackled and suddenly Twilight was next to her. A few sparks of magic indicated she teleported. "What is it?" Twilight inquired. Her mane had frazzled, and there was the occasional twitching in one of her eyelids. "S-Should we head back? Did we get spotted? Do we have to fight—"\n\n"Stop Twilighting!" Dash snapped back.\n\n"I'm not 'Twilighting,' I'm just asking—"\n\nTwilight's retort was muffled as Dash placed a wing over her muzzle. Repeating her information that she provided Rarity, Dash declared, "Patrol. Pretty sure they're hunting us."\n\n"But we lost them outside of Cloudsdale, how could they even get here before us?!" Twilight demanded after pushing Dash's wing out of her face. "Unless—" She shuddered and wrapped both her wings around herself. With a small whimper, she whined, "Unless Daybreaker has convinced them we're the enemy."\n\nAt the mention of Celestia's new name, the atmosphere of their hiding place grew as cold as Pinkie's secret ice cream stash. Said pony had somehow managed to peel herself off the ground, and was craning her neck far above the bush in which they were hiding. Somehow. Given she was still straddled under one of Dash's forearms.\n\n"They're gone," Pinkie stated flatly before slithering out and leaving the bush.\n\n"Finally," Rarity grunted as she pushed Dash off her. Brushing off some of the debris in her fur, she growled, "Must we take these overgrown paths, Twilight? We are we even going?"\n\n"[CRY.GetNameDef], but not by obvious ways," Twilight replied. Gritting her teeth as she stared up through the canopy of trees in the forest west of Cloudsdale, she finally sighed, "But if they're looking for us, then I think we'll need some outside help."\n\nAs Applejack and Fluttershy met with the other four, they all asked in unison, "Who?"\n\nTwilight smirked. "A well-traveled pony.""
  solarreworked.157.a:0 "Anypony need a dimension hopper?"
  solarreworked.158.t:0 "Twilight 0.5"
  solarreworked.158.d:0 ""Are you sure it's safe here?" Twilight inquired as she anxiously sipped on a bit of tea that was proffered her by her host. As if to emphasize her point, there were a couple of distant gunshots and explosions outside of the large tent in which she and her friends resided. Some of her mane stood on end for a second or two before settling down, albeit more unkempt than before.\n\n"Well, it's as safe as any tent with no shield spells can be when it's within stray artillery shot range," Sunset Shimmer stated with a small chuckle. Her cyan eyes sparkled with mirth when Twilight gave a small neigh and started to summon said spell. Waving a hoof dismissively, Sunset added, "It was a joke, Twilight. It's perfectly safe."\n\n"Um, what about the two guards outside?" Fluttershy meekly intoned, tying her mane back into a bun and adjusting her soiled scientist lab coat. "We did have a pretty harrowing trip here."\n\n"So you've said," muttered Sunset as she scratched her chin. "They're hoof-picked by me. They're fine." Furrowing her brow, she grunted, "They follow my commands, not Daybreaker's."\n\n"How can you still work for that—"\n\n"Bitch?" Sunset quipped before Rainbow Dash could finish. At everypony's gaping expression, Sunset tittered, "Might have picked up a few words here and there. And the answer is that I don't, but I haven't found the right time to desert. At least right now, I can have final say in my army's orders, not her." As she bared her teeth, she stated, "So, you're wanting to find a way to stop her?"\n\n"Well..." Twilight gulped and twirled her mane. "She's locked down Canterlot. The Elements are missing. I'm not sure we CAN without them."\n\n"So, what, you're just running?!" Sunset snapped, before a commotion sprung up outside her tent. Both guards started moving, then there were gunshots, and blood splattered against the tent. In an instant, Sunset's horn flared a dark crimson, with Twilight and Rarity's following with their own fields. Fluttershy dove to the ground, while the others took to the air or stood their ground.\n\n"Marshal Shimmer, I'd suggest you surrender. I brought an entire company with me," a bored voice called through the tent.\n\n"Okay, maybe I was wrong," Sunset growled softly to Twilight. "I guess some ponies agree with that crap." As the voice outside started to count, Sunset whispered, "On three. I'll shield. You teleport. I guess we play it your way for now."\n\n"See you in Tartarus, Lily!" Sunset screamed just as the voice reached zero, and a hailstorm of lead punctured the tent. When it was removed, all of the ponies and one dragon were missing."

  solarreworked.159.t:0 "The Hunt for Purple Twilight"
  solarreworked.159.d:0 "So far, our forces have been able to keep up with Twilight Sparkle and her friends. What loyal elements of S.M.I.L.E. that we have dispatched have reported that she has headed west. Recently, an officer of Sunset Shimmer's army group reported that Sunset had harbored Twilight and her compatriots, and was conspiring with them to aid them in escaping. She attempted to apprehend them, and dealt with two traitors, but claims that they disappeared with magic in the short time she allowed for them to come out to be taken into custody.\n\nAs of yet, she has not been able to determine where they could have fled. If Sunset Shimmer agreed to assist them in fleeing, as it appears, then there are a couple of possibilities that she said would be most likely. [CRY.GetNameDef] and [EQC.GetNameDef]. [CRY.GetNameDef] would be a probable location, given its proximity to our nation and because [CRY.GetLeader] is Twilight's sister-in-law, and has always expressed sympathies to plights of Twilight and her ilk. However, [EQC.GetNameDef] is undeniably a safer location to flee to. [EQC.GetLeader] has been an outspoken supporter of the previous regime, and has yet to indicate that [EQC.GetLeader.GetSheHe] will fall in line.\n\nAs of yet, no further news from S.M.I.L.E.'s agents have surfaced with information on where the group has fled. With two equally valid options, it would be difficult to properly concentrate our resources to capture them. Currently, the situation within [EQS.GetNameDef] is too unstable to dedicate infinite capital to, as we must cover many ports of entry or exit and do so in significant force to overpower two talented mages.\n\n[CRY.GetNameDef] is obvious, but [EQC.GetNameDef] would potentially be the wiser option. Ultimately, Empress, the choice is yours."
  solarreworked.159.a:0 "[CRY.GetNameDefCap] is the closest and she has family there. She will have fled in that direction."

Complete deployment of the Equestrian Army forces that we could spare has been put into motion, and almost every location has a small garrison, if not more, ready to apprehend all of them.\n\nHowever, as of yet, there has been no activity. None of them have been seen in any settlements, and all transport into and out of the villages, towns, and cities are constantly being monitored. So far, they have not been spotted.\n\nS.M.I.L.E. is not reporting any further intelligence on their whereabouts, however, with discord within the organization, they are not at full strength, and also have been focusing on areas around where our troops have been stationed. What few agents they have that are not dedicated to this have yet to dig up anything on the other potential route of escape.\n\nAlthough our forces can continue their patrols and investigations, as time continues on, it is more likely that Twilight has escaped us and fled to the other potential destination. There is less point to maintaining this costly endeavor before it leads to further issues maintaining control.\n\nIt appears that whatever happened to Twilight and the others, they have eluded our grasp."

We only pulled into Mareway to pick up a few passengers. They're probably just checking tickets." Despite her statement, her voice was slightly quivering. Dark circles surrounded her eyes. Unconsciously, she was twitching in an anxious manner, and she also darted her attention outside the train car, like Dash was doing.\n\nSnow whipped outside on the platform, and she shivered. Although they had a bit of protective clothing, they'd need to pick up some proper outer wear after they arrived in [CRY.GetNameDef]. Instinctively, she shot a glance at Rarity, who was humming and thinking to herself as she performed a bit of manual sewing on a new shirt. Why Rarity had insisted on bringing a sewing kit along, and thread to make new clothing was still beyond her.\n\n"Twilight," Sunset whispered, breaking Twilight out of her thoughts. She tapped Twilight's shoulder lightly. When Twilight focused on Sunset, she pointed out the window, and Twilight gulped. Approaching the platform at which the train had been stationed, she spotted a patrol of soldiers, about two dozen strong. At least a couple of unicorn mages were also with them.\n\n"Is this why we're stopped here?" Twilight mumbled aloud.\n\n"I don't know, but I know what I need to do," Sunset growled. Her horn flashed momentarily. "They're not close enough yet. If flank them, I can make it look like it was only me going to the train, and I can lead them away. Make them think it'll go to the rest of you."\n\n"Sunset, no!" Twilight exclaimed, drawing everypony's attention. Her face flushing, she hissed, "That's a death sentence!"\n\n"I know, but at least—"\n\n"I'm going with you."\n\nSunset shook her head, but before she could protest, Twilight furrowed her brow. "It's double the targets. And if we can both elude them, I can teleport us back here, even after its on the move."\n\n"And where she goes, I go," Spike grunted.\n\nCasting her gaze between Twilight and Spike, Sunset finally sighed and rubbed her temples. "We do it my way, okay? If we juke them, we can go from there, got it?" Twilight nodded, and they slipped away, after explaining their plan.\n\nTeary-eyed, Twilight inhaled and as they got within spotting distance of the patrol, she whimpered, "Here goes everything.""
  solarreworked.161.d_b:0 ""You think that New Mareland will have any statues of me in Sunset?" Sunset Shimmer inquired as she leaned over to Twilight while the two of them slowly trotted through one of the streets leading to the wharf of San Manetonio. Although both were being blasted by the intense southern sun, which felt even hotter than usual, they both were chilled. Twilight held in her magic a few basic items, Sunset had a single toothbrush which she "had to replace" before their voyage.\n\nTwilight shot Sunset a bemused stare. With a smirk, Sunset stated, "Well, since it's called SUNSET, after all." She shrugged. "I guess we can't all have cities named after us."\n\n"You know that's not the history of Sunset, Sunset," Twilight huffed, which earned a light punch in the shoulder from the unicorn. Nickering, she ruffled one of her wings, which were concealed underneath a simple blouse that Rarity had sewn on the trip to San Manetonio. Why she insisted to bring sewing gear was still beyond Twilight.\n\nStill, it made her slightly less conspicuous.\n\n"I know!" Sunset snickered. "Can't I try to cheer you up?" She snorted. "Sure, we may be on the run, but you're being even more of a grouch than usual."\n\n"I am NOT being a grouch, I'm just—"\n\n"Eh, sounds like something a grouch would say," Sunset interjected playfully.\n\n"Sunset's right, Twilight," Spike, who was walking behind them. He nibbled on a jawbreaker they'd gotten for him.\n\nSticking out her tongue, she suddenly froze and pulled Twilight against the wall of a nearby building. As they were both plastered to the brick, Sunset hissed, "There's a patrol. I didn't think that they'd guard these ports. Not this quickly!"\n\nTwilight could see Sunset sweating. In the distance, the freighter on which they bought passage could be seen at the dock. It was still tethered, but activity on the decks indicated they'd be shoving off shortly. A single, hard, spear of anxiety pierced her heart, and she glanced at Sunset. Sunset returned it.\n\n"They're heading toward the freighter," she whispered to Sunset. While it was true, they were clearly investigating every business and house along the way. At a size of fifty or so soldiers, it wouldn't take long, though. Twilight gulped.\n\nAs a knot built in her stomach, she muttered, "I can't risk exposing my friends. They'd be captured, or killed!" She gritted her teeth. "We're going to—"\n\nBefore she could finish her thought, a soldier leaving a building nearby spotted them, and called the alarm. Sunset immediately fired a bolt of magic at him, and grazed his shoulder. He dropped, and Sunset snarled, "I guess we're the distraction now, then. Run!""

  solarreworked.162.t:0 "Refugees from [EQS.GetNameDef]"
  solarreworked.162.d_a:0 "At the break of dawn this morning, a group of seven ponies and a dragon hurriedly passed through our customs and requested to speak with [ROOT.GetLeader]. After the initial confusion of such a demand passed, the border guards recognized the group as Princess Twilight Sparkle and her friends, as well as Princess Celestia's former student, Sunset Shimmer.\n\nIn short order, Princess Twilight was taken to [ROOT.GetLeader], where she explained the situation that they were in as best she could. As feared when [EQS.GetLeader] declared [EQS.GetNameDef], freedoms have been quickly suppressed and ponies who once lived in safety and harmony have been rounded up if they do not submit to the new regime. An attempt was made to capture Twilight and her friends, but they managed to evade pursuit on their way to [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nThe news is both unsurprising and shocking to see how far Equestria has fallen. Although it is clear that Princess Twilight wishes to find a way to restore Harmony in Equestria, she has said that she knows that it will be a challenge just by herself and with her friends. While she gathers allies in an attempt to liberate Equestria, she and the Element Bearers have offered their services to us. Their skills will prove invaluable in aiding our country, and there is absolutely no reason for us to refuse.\n\nWe can only hope we can play a small part in the liberation of Harmony."
  solarreworked.162.d_b:0 "This morning our customs officials reported of a disturbance caused by five ponies and dragon, who, after an altercation between a pegasus and one of our guards, was finally recognized as the Element of Harmony's bearers. Princess Twilight was missing, and in the hectic first contact, the guards did not realize to whom they were speaking. When the scuffle was sorted out with an apology from Rainbow Dash and a promise to pay for a cider for the guard she assaulted, Applejack requested to speak with [ROOT.GetLeader].\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] was quickly briefed and met with the Element Bearers. After a short window of emotion, where Rarity demanded the biggest tub of ice cream possible, Rainbow Dash and Applejack informed [ROOT.GetLeader] what had happened. As feared, when [EQS.GetLeader] proclaimed [EQS.GetNameDef], the freedoms Equestrian citizens enjoyed quickly dried up. Anypony who didn't submit to [EQS.GetLeader] was at risk of arrest. Multiple attempts were made against Princess Twilight and her friends, and almost all failed, except for their last stop before escaping to [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nUnfortunately, [EQS.GetLeader]'s forces were able to track them, and in a bid to keep the rest of her friends safe, Twilight and Princess Celestia's former student, Sunset Shimmer, stayed behind to fend off the company of soldiers. It is unknown what happened to them.\n\nRainbow Dash and Applejack are the two ponies handling it the best, and they were realistic. They could try to gather allies, but without Twilight, it was less likely to succeeded. In the meantime, everypony will do whatever they can to assist us. Even without Twilight, their skills are invaluable, and we'd be foalish to refuse.\n\nWe can only pray that Twilight Sparkle escaped and can regroup to save Harmony."
  solarreworked.162.a:0 "We will do whatever we can to help."
  solarreworked.163.t:0 "Discovery"
  solarreworked.163.d:0 "Rubbing her aching forehead, Luna closed her eyes momentarily as she stared at some of the latest intelligence reports of [EQS.GetNameDef]. All around her, activity buzzed as a number of crystal ponies and a few Equestrian refugees gathered around the table to which she had called them. Outside, the moon hung low on the horizon, barely peeking above the mountains of [CRY.GetNameDef]. Flakes of snow lightly batted against the windows of her estate, provided by Cadance.\n\nStill, she eventually sighed and placed the paper on a pile of others. Looking over to Midnight Oil, she inquired, "Have you any further ideas?"\n\nHe merely shook his head. Glancing around the room at the rest of the ponies assembled, he adjusted his glasses and stated solemnly, "We have exhausted almost every possibility of garnering more public support, Princess. It's not that many of the crystal ponies aren't sympathetic, it's more—"\n\n"They fear," interjected Luna with a tone of resignation. As she finished his declaration, a wave of murmurs rose through the assembled ponies, and she could veritably taste the worry running between them. A single shiver worked down her spine.\n\nWhile Cadance's help had been appreciated, the fact of [EQS.GetNameDef] being so close to her realm did deter some from joining. So long as they didn't provoke Daybreaker—as the common sentiment went—they'd be left alone. Every time she had been told that, she could barely suppress her derision. Did that work when Chrysalis decided to invade Olenia?\n\nBut action demanded much, and certainly with her current numbers of a dozen or so for her inner circle and a few hundred eager volunteers, she didn't have an army. When that thought came to her, she groaned and massaged her temples, which only made the mumbles around the table grow louder.\n\nSoon, though, she felt a pony approach and gently prod her. Reluctantly opening her eyes, she saw a servant standing before her, bearing a number of hot beverages. "For the night, Princess?" the mare inquired. She had already passed a few cups to others there. Luna merely nodded, and the mare began to grab a cup of coffee, and Luna caught a glint in the mare's hoof.\n\nAs she did, Luna's ears flattened against her skull as there was a deafening bang, and a burst of red sprayed from the servant's chest. She fell back, a small blade falling from her hoof's grip, and Luna whipped around to see Midnight holstering his pistol. Almost instantly, Luna's heart began to pound against her chest. In the stunned silence after the gunshot, she could barely hear the servant sputter, "Sol Invictus, Imperatrix benedicat me.""

  solarreworked.164.d:0 ""It's a shame the rest of your friends couldn't come to help..." Charred Beam muttered as she sucked on a milkshake while she sat across from Rainbow Dash and Rarity. The three of them had gathered in a small cafe in [ROOT.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and the young, charcoal-colored mare glanced uneasily between the two Element Bearers. While Rainbow Dash returned the evaluation, Rarity daintily sipped on a glass of tea which she had ordered.\n\n"Yeah, well, you got us," Rainbow quipped as she drummed a hoof impatiently on the table. Glancing around, she arched a brow as a number of the customers started to stream out of the cafe. "Hey, don't tell me they're closing this place already."\n\n"Dash, please, manners," Rarity interjected. Placing down her tea, she smiled when a waitress stopped by and offered a refill. Said waitress went around and grabbed bits that had been left on each now-empty table. "It was merely coincidence. Now, Charred—" she folded her hooves together and stared directly at the mare "—you said that you had a friendship problem. We are a tad... ehm, BUSY, but nevertheless, we shall strive to help you!" She primped at her mane. "You have Rarity's word!"\n\n"Uh, Rares," Rainbow declared, tapping Rarity on the shoulder.\n\n"Not now, Dash!" Rarity snapped back without bothering to glance at her friend. "Just because you have an attention span of—" Cutting herself off with a cough, she tittered, "Anyway, with what can we aid you? Trouble with a sibling? Tension at work? Nerves about..." Her voice died when Rainbow smacked her, hard, on the shoulder and she saw what Rainbow was indicating.\n\nA number of ponies had entered, all armed heavily. Even though they were without identification, it was easy to tell who had sent them.\n\n"You really should have invited the rest of your chums," quipped Charred with tsk. Loudly slurping on her milkshake, she cracked a grin and stated, "Now I'm going to have to work even harder for Empress dearest." Popping her joints a couple of times, she nodded to the thugs. "Well, I suppose it'll be—"\n\nBefore Charred could finish, Rainbow Dash had grabbed Rarity roughly under the shoulders and instantly darted off in a rainbow trail. As Rainbow bowled over a number of the thugs with Charred, Charred huffed. "Figures. They have to make it interesting.""
  solarreworked.164.a:0 "We have to run! But where?!"
  solarreworked.165.t:0 "Flight of the Alicorn"
  solarreworked.165.d_a:0 "Novo's heart quivered. Normally, anxiety was not something that could be described as something she was prone to. Even when the Storm King had threatened the very safety of Seaquestria and Mount Aris, she had remained calm, collected, cold. But now...\n\nGrimacing and stretching one of her talons, she tapped the wharf's dock impatiently. Surrounded by a couple dozen of her best trained guards, she eyed the small ship as it docked against the pier and a few ponies moored the vessel. After they had safely tightened the ropes keeping it to the dock, the gangplank was lowered, and Novo's heart palpitated again.\n\nPrincess Luna had arrived.\n\nThere had been communication since Luna had fled [CRY.GetNameDef], of course. Whatever she had cajoled to take her to [ROOT.GetNameDef], it was equipped with a decent radio. And that was what had set her nerves on edge.\n\nAll of her guards stood straighter as Luna descended, and despite the alicorn's relative youth, she looked to have aged a couple of hundred years since Novo had had the opportunity to catch up with she and Celestia. Like she was staring right through Novo and the welcoming party, Luna looked at Aris in the distance, the mountain surrounded by a delightful and inviting lake.\n\nForcing a smile upon her face, Novo flapped her way toward Luna. "Princess!" she exclaimed with a small bow. "It is an honor that you are here." When Luna returned her greeting with a slight tilt of her head, Novo added, "I'm glad to see you're safe."\n\n"Dost thou—" Luna grimaced. "Do you believe I am?" Fidgeting her wings a couple of times, she motioned for the only pair of guards that she had to stand back. At the moment, it was just her and Novo, alone on the dock. Monarch to diarch. Luna furrowed her brow. "Verily, my niece considered me secure, and now look at me." Splaying her front legs wide in a gesture to indicate herself, she stated, "I am a fugitive. A wretch. I have no principality. I have no sister."\n\n"What happened?" Novo licked her beak. "You never told me what went down."\n\nWith a dull, frustrated groan, Luna hung her head and marched forward. "Cel—Daybreaker infiltrated my closest confidants." At that, her mane whipped violently. "I nearly perished," she replied as she looked back at Novo. Softly, tears glistened in her eyes. "I do not expect much aid, Novo. I roof above my head is sufficient. I shall... organize resistance against my sister from here. Somehow."\n\n"Like Tartarus you are, honey," declared Novo, flying over to Luna and resting a clawed hand on her shoulder. Novo grinned. "You just came to the last, best hope Harmony has. We'll see you through." She giggled. "Be sure to give your sis a kick in the tush, just for me, when the time comes."\n\nLuna smirked."
  solarreworked.165.d_b:0 "Casting a hoof over her forehead, River Swirl watched as the speck that was the airplane carrying Princess Luna descended toward the Rijekograd airport. The entire facility had been closed, and only the necessary staff to ensure a safe landing had been kept there. Beside her, Arclight stood silently, his face creased with a steadily-deepening frown. She briefly checked him again, her own demeanor darkening as she saw the firm scowl that had built upon his features.\n\nSoon enough, the roar of propellors reached her ears, and the dozen or so bodyguards that she had spread out to cover the airstrip. As the minutes dragged on, she watched as the large, unwieldy transport plane nosed toward the runway, flaring at the last minute so its landing gear could catch and rapidly bring it to a halt. Once it landed, slightly past her and Arclight, she breathed a sigh and galloped over to the plane's hatch.\n\nIn short order, it opened and one of Princess Luna's Night Guards disembarked first. He eyed her warily, but when Luna followed directly behind him, his obvious distrust faded when she greeted River Swirl. River Swirl bowed.\n\n"Thou needst not—" Luna cleared her throat. With a widening, awkward smile, she repeated, "You need not treat me with such reverence, fair River Swirl." She sighed. Drooping her shoulders, she flapped off the staircase from the plane and landed next to River Swirl. By now, Arclight had come to stand beside River again.\n\nWhen Luna noticed him, she arched a brow. "I believe we have not had the pleasantry of an introduction."\n\n"Arclight, OHS director," he simply replied. "I already know about you, Princess." When Luna nickered, his eyes narrowed a smidgen. "Good and bad."\n\nWith an awkward laugh, River interjected, "Yet we all believe in the same thing, no?" Arclight and Luna nodded. After seeing that the situation had de-escalated, she breathed a sigh of relief and asked, "Your radio message to us was brief, Princess." She swallowed. "What's it like on Equus?"\n\nLeaning in, Arclight looked to be eagerly awaiting Luna's response. Granted, she was, too, but she could at least refrain from showing it.\n\nAfter a minute, Luna huffed, "Terrible. Horrendous. My ponies are unrecognizable. They serve my fallen sister happily. Readily. Giddily." At that, River's face blanched and she started to anxiously tap a hoof against the pavement of the runway. Luna continued with a growl, "Executions. Lockdowns." She thumped a hoof on the ground. "And nothing that could be done."\n\nFlattening her ears against her head, River glanced at Arclight and she declared, "You will not be alone, Princess." She puffed out her chest. "Equestria needs everypony's help, and we will not abandon it. You have our full support."\n\nLuna could only smirk."
  solarreworked.165.d_c:0 "Ripples of heat carried themselves up from the blistering sands and pavement that made up the landscape of [MGY.GetCapital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Even standing at the coast provided little reprieve from the sweltering oppression that was the desert. However, Somnambula barely registered it, as she waited, steadily watching as a small vessel moved to dock with one of the piers at the waterfront. From what she could see, about half a dozen ponies were rushing around on the deck, tossing rope and anchor. Shortly, they had moored to the dock, and the gangplank descended.\n\nFlaring her wings, she quickly flitted to the end of the gangplank, taking a step back as she heard the cocking of a gun and a pony dressed in the dark armor of Princess Luna's Night Guard take aim at her. However, she remained calm. Flashing the soldier a smile, she quipped, "The Princess is expecting me. You wouldn't shoot one of the Pillars of Equestria, would you?"\n\nThe guard eyed her for a moment. Then he relented and lowered his weapon. "Fine," he grunted.\n\nDarting aboard, Somnambula almost ran straight into Luna, who was leaving one of the cabins on the ship. "Fairest Somnambula," she declared with a nod of her head. "We did not expect to see thee until We disembarked. Thy appearance is a pleasant, if disappointing, surprise."\n\nSomnambula arched an eyebrow. "Princess, I thought you'd want to see me as soon as you arrived." Pawing at the deck of the ship with a forehoof, she glanced away from Luna, and she coughed. "Besides, I'm... I'm all that's here to greet you."\n\n"Not even a civil servant of [ROOT.GetLeader]? Did my communique not arrive clearly?"\n\n"N-No, it did," she stuttered. Breathing in a couple of times to keep herself centered, she ruffled her wings and straightened her skirt. "We simply don't have a means to help you, Princess. You're welcome here, as an ally of our earliest dynasty, but..." She cleared her throat again. "You know what? I'm sure that things will improve here soon, and then [ROOT.GetLeader] will be able to spare something to help free Equestria."\n\nNickering and flicking her head back to readjust her mane, Somnambula smiled wider as Luna scrutinized her. As the seconds stretched into a minute, Somnambula's toothy grin grew wider, and she tittered uncomfortably. Much of her serenity seemed to be shattered simply by Luna's piercing gaze.\n\nFinally, Luna huffed and she inquired, "And thou dost truly believe this?"\n\nA single twitch of Somnambula's cheek was the only betrayal of her true feelings as she proclaimed, "Absolutely!""

  solarreworked.166.d_a:0 ""Are we there yet? I'm getting the biggest wing cramp this side of Cloudsdale!" Twilight Sparkle furrowed her brow at Rainbow Dash's consistent whining. For the last... was it ten hours? Twelve? Regardless, for an extended period of time, the pegasus had moaned and bellyached about the slow pace of she and her friends' mode of travel. As Dash was about to go on another tirade about the state of her body, Twilight grunted.\n\n"Rainbow, you do realize that we don't have much of a choice, right?" She gestured to the cabin in which they currently resided. Rarity was perusing a five-year-old magazine, Fluttershy had fallen asleep, Applejack added to Dash's antsy demeanor with her own pacing, and Pinkie stared out the only porthole. Little seemed to give her hope.\n\nSunset had wandered off to chat with the sailors taking them to [ROOT.GetNameDef]. Offhandedly, she had quipped about no concert on the trip, and no risk of getting sucked down a magical drain. Despite the circumstances, Twilight had chuckled at the reference.\n\n"Well, just how much longer is it going to take?! I'm cooped up in here and—"\n\nAs if to answer Dash's complaining, the small ship they were on rattled and bumped as it berthed against something solid. "Hey, we landed," Pinkie muttered, tracing a hoof along the edge of the porthole's glass.\n\nArching a brow momentarily, Twilight shook her head and pushed open their tight cabin's door. She nearly smacked into Sunset. Scratching her head awkwardly, Twilight muttered a quick apology then hopped off the ship before the ramp had even been lowered. Standing on the pier, flanked by a pair of hippogriffs, Princess Luna watched, her lips a thin line, as Twilight hurried toward her.\n\n"Hey, Twilight! You forgot—" she heard Sunset start to call before the unicorn cut herself off with a soft "oh."\n\n"Princess!" exclaimed Twilight as she briefly exchanged an embrace with Luna. She shivered. Likewise, Luna was tense, almost as stiff as an iron statue. Stepping back, Twilight babbled, "We were attacked by Daybreaker's agents and we heard that you escaped here so we thought we'd find you and—"\n\n"Twilight," interjected Luna as she reached out a hoof and pressed it gently on Twilight's muzzle. "You already informed me of this. Recall how it was I that directed you here." Pointing back at the two guards, she stated, "[ROOT.GetLeader] has already promised us aid." She sighed. "But I fear that it will not be enough. My sister..." She never finished her thought. However, her frown said it all.\n\nTwilight swallowed. Glancing back at her friends, she saw them disembark, then she caught, "Ohmygosh! Princess Twilight!" She whipped her head back around in time to see Skystar slam into her, gripping her tightly in a vice-like hug. "I thought you might have sunk at sea, but I mean, that's totally silly because, like—"\n\nTwilight's vision hazed over as the enthusiastic hippogriff continued squeezing the very air out of her."
  solarreworked.166.d_b:0 ""You know, I never got used to flying," Sunset Shimmer quipped as she plopped down in a seat across from Twilight. Although well-muffled, the din of the propellors on the private plane taking she, Twilight, and the rest of Twilight's friends to [ROOT.GetNameDef] still carried into the cabin. With a small chuckle, she caught Twilight's wings ruffling instinctively, and she added, "I wanted to rule, to become an alicorn for so long, and yet, I never really liked being stuck in a plane."\n\n"You kidding me? I'd rather pass out from flying for five days straight than be stuck in one of these cans for an hour." With a bemused glance, Sunset caught Rainbow Dash's disturbed frown as she continually fidgeted in her own seat. "Flying with your wings is WAY different than a plane," she finally added.\n\n"Quit your moaning. You sound just like Aunt Crabapple after she got into the cider," Applejack groused as she raised her hat to glare at Dash. Beside her, Rarity was currently snoring, a sleeping mask blocking any light from reaching her eyes. A sliver of drool dribbled down her chin.\n\nDash huffed and crossed her forelegs.\n\nWithout warning, there was a lurch as the plane started to descend, and Sunset gripped her seat with a hoof. It only took a few minutes to land, but soon they were on the runway of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s airport, and Sunset caught Twilight break away from the group to dash to a taller, blue alicorn waiting to the side. Princess Luna. Flanking Luna were two ponies. For a second or two, Sunset racked her brain before she placed the one as River Swirl, who won a landslide against an old communist rival. The other was an enigma.\n\n"What?!" she caught Twilight blurt out as she broke from a quick hug with Luna. Face aghast, Twilight had taken a couple of steps back. Floating her belongings which had been freed from luggage storage in her magic, Sunset trotted up to Twilight. She managed to hear the tail end of Twilight saying something. "...nothing about us?!" was all she discerned.\n\n"Something wrong?" she interjected, causing Twilight to jump and Luna to asses her with squinted eyes.\n\nAfter a moment, Luna was the one to break the silence. "Sunset Shimmer. My sister spoke of thee, when she was sane. We did not—"\n\n"Princess, please," interrupted Twilight.\n\nLuna nickered. "I did not expect that you were with Twilight. I would have believed, from what she said, that you would jump at the chance to serve her."\n\n"Yeah, well, I'm not letting my past dictate my future." Furrowing her brow a smidgen, Sunset snorted. "Now, what's going on?"\n\n"Politics," quipped River Swirl. As she butted into the conversation, she gestured to the stallion with her. "Director Arclight has already started gathering intelligence on Equestria, but—" she sighed "—convincing ponies to fight and maybe die for a country a continent away is... difficult."\n\n"That all?" Sunset smirked. "I've experienced worse.""
  solarreworked.166.d_c:0 "Anxiously tapping her hooves on the cafe table in [ROOT.GetCapital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Twilight Sparkle glanced between each of her friends. Rarity was sipping on a cup of coffee, while Applejack was staring off into the distance at the horizon. The sun was setting upon the city, and great swirls of sand licked up into the sky and occasionally deposited grains on them, even so far away from the storms. The rest of her friend were still getting something from the shop.\n\nAlthough she had also requested a coffee—as [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] coffee was something she had never had the chance to try—she had yet to actually sample it. Her magic was a wreck. Even trying to levitate such a simple object threatened to spill the whole cup on her. Her jumbled nerves wouldn't allow it.\n\nShe cupped her head into her hooves. Exhaling loudly, she mumbled, "Princess Luna's late."\n\n"Twilight, I'm sure the Princess is quite busy, what being an exile and all that." Rarity blew on her coffee. "She will arrive precisely when she can, and not a moment earlier."\n\nScrunching her muzzle at Rarity's supposedly sage advice, Twilight merely grunted, "Gee. Thanks. That makes me feel SO much better."\n\nRarity sighed. As she folded the magazine she had found at another table up, she fixed Twilight with a heavy stare. Twilight wriggled and darted her gaze everywhere but Rarity. "Twilight, I am just as concerned as you. No, I'm probably more concerned." Rarity held up a hoof. "But, it does not befit a lady to waffle and whimper on such things. We must take action, but we must—"\n\n"Fair Rarity, your desire will be harder to achieve than you believe." With strong hoofsteps, Princess Luna trundled up to the table, and Rarity stopped herself mid-sentence with a small squeak. Somehow, Luna had aged a century, as her mane was slightly ragged, and there were dark bags around her eyes. While they once burned with determination, there was now nothing more than a small ember of energy left.\n\n"I beg your pardon, Princess, but I don't believe I quite follow," stammered Rarity as she floated over a chair for Luna to sit at. She gasped a second later as Somnambula flew in behind Luna.\n\n"Princess Luna speaks the truth," she declared as she gave a nod to Twilight and Rarity. With that declaration, a heady silence descended upon the table, and she met each pony's gaze a moment before she hung her head. Twilight merely swallowed.\n\nAfter a moment or two, Somnambula deflated, her own confidence sapping away before their eyes. Scraping a chair against the ground and making herself a seat, Somnambula huffed as a small wisp of sand blew in front of her face, "We have tried much, but [ROOT.GetLeader] has his hooves tied." She bit her lip. "I'm sorry, Princess Twilight, but there's little more that can be offered to you other than refuge."\n\n"Oh." Twilight's stomach churned. Glancing at Rarity, she finally mumbled, "I guess that's something.""

Although she and her friends were close to port, the bright rays bounced directly off the water, piercing directly into her vision like spears of fire. She sighed. Heavy hooves clip-clopped next to her and she gave a side-eyed glance at Rainbow Dash.\n\nDash was quiet. Too quiet. After a moment, she whipped some of her mane back and ruffled her wings. She shifted her gaze to Applejack and asked in a flat tone, "Do you think that Luna will meet us?"\n\nApplejack bit her lip. "Don't reckon there'd be a reason she WOULDN'T."\n\n"Well, you know, since Twilight—" Rainbow's breath hitched momentarily. Furrowing her brow, she continued with a growl, "Since Twilight isn't here, maybe she had more important things to do."\n\n"Nah, she's gonna be there," Pinkie mumbled as she trotted to the other side of Applejack. Despite the brilliant sunlight, she managed to look like she was shrouded in eternal gloom. While some of her cheer had disappeared in the war, her coat hadn't lost most of its luster and vibrancy until after Twilight was—\n\nApplejack cut off her line of thought. There was still a chance. Somewhere, somehow. With Princess Luna already in [ROOT.GetNameDef], there had to be one. The hippogriffs were one of Equestria's closest allies. They had to be planning something to help take down Daybreaker and restore Harmony to Equus.\n\n"Oh, look, there she is now." Muzzle pressed into a line, Pinkie stretched out a hoof and gestured toward a figure on the dock that was rapidly approaching. Instantly, Applejack removed her hat and held it against her chest. Soon enough, she was off the ship, along with the rest of her friends, after the ship they had found passage on docked.\n\nMarching past Rarity, who was currently stacking a fifth case of luggage onto one of the crew stallions, Applejack gave a quick bow to Luna as the alicorn approached the group. Luna was flanked on either side by a pair of hippogriff guards. She nodded a greeting. "Fair Applejack, it is pleasing to know that thou and the rest of thy companions are well."\n\n"You don't need to speak so fancy, Princess." Standing straight again, Applejack gave Luna a weak smile. "Unless you're wanting to put on a show to the 'griffs, that is." Luna smirked.\n\n"Nay, I merely reflect the gravity of our predicament." Furrowing her brow, she indicated with a wing for the disembarked ponies to follow her. As she did, the guards moved to escort the group. Luna pressed her tongue against one of her cheeks. "I admit, the loss of Twilight is regrettable, and I yearned to offer my sincerest sympathies to you." She glanced at the five friends. "Alas, there is more apologies I must present." For a moment, she steeled herself, then muttered, "We may be on our own, even now. [ROOT.GetLeader] is... difficult to convince."\n\nAfter a moment, she hung her head."
  solarreworked.166.d_e:0 "Twitching one of her ears with every slight adjustment to the altitude of the plane, Rainbow Dash paced impatiently up and down the cabin in which the rest of her friends sat. A few beads of sweat cascaded down the back of her neck, soaking the fringes of her mane, so that it clung to her fur. Every step was jittery, and she glanced occasionally at the walls that made up their flying tomb.\n\nWhy couldn't they have taken a ship? Maybe a motorcade through eastern Griffonia? Then she could get out and fly herself. Up here? All it took was one malfunction in an engine, and then—\n\n"Rainbow Dash, sit down this instant!" Rarity huffed from her chair. With a practiced stink eye, she glowered at Dash over the edge of a magazine. "In case you SOMEHOW didn't hear, we're descending." She huffed and flicked through a couple of pages.\n\n"Oh." With an air of trepidation, she slipped into the seat next to Fluttershy, who was humming softly to herself and staring out the window that she sat next to. Dash fidgeted. As she jiggled one of her legs impatiently, she followed Fluttershy's gaze and saw as the airfield of Rijekograd's airport came toward them. In no time at all, there was a heavy bump and then the plane soon braked to a halt.\n\nAs soon as it stopped, Dash released herself from her seat and bolted out the door to plane, before the stewardess could and before there was a ladder provided down. She let out a small whoop as she dove for the ground and began to kiss it loudly. However, it was only a couple of times, and she spat out the gunk that got in her teeth and on her lips. When she was done, she glanced up at the shadow that had come to stand over her, and she immediately bowed to the floor again.\n\nPrincess Luna stood above her. On her face, a scowl born of clearly a hundred irritants, was laid full bare on Dash. "Get up," Luna finally huffed. She switched her gaze to the rest of Dash's friends as they disembarked. It didn't soften. When the others got closer, she stated, "We're on our own."\n\n Immediately, Dash's heart sunk into the pit of her stomach, and instead she soon felt like something was going to erupt. Snarling, she wrinkled her brow and snapped, "WHAT?! Just like that?!" She flailed a hoof to point in a random direction. "Equestria's ruled by a wacko and Twilight's been captured, and you say that—"\n\n"I know exactly what I said, Rainbow Dash." Although it was even, Luna's tone darkened further when she addressed Dash. Her eyes practically glowed in fury. "I know every. Single. Word." She sighed. Some of the anger disappeared in an instant. "Nopony here truly cares, as they have their own problems." She swallowed. "We are on our own.""
  solarreworked.166.d_f:0 ""Ugh, are we certain that Daybreaker hasn't established herself here? It's sweltering, and all this sand is ruining my coiffure." With a grunt, Rarity shook herself as she felt a few more grains of sand blow against her muzzle and neck. Spitting a couple of times to get the dirt out of her mouth, she batted at her tongue, and whinnied when she only succeeded in getting more sand on it instead.\n\nShooting a lopsided grin at Rarity, Rainbow Dash quipped, "Hey, at least it's not being burnt at the stake or something, right?" Rarity just sniffed angrily.\n\n"Um, not to interrupt, but weren't we supposed to go IN to meet Somnambula?" Fluttershy shifted on her hooves and gestured to the unassuming cafe as she shared a glance between the two bickering ponies. Both Dash and Rarity shot a look her way, and then Rarity let out a small noise of realization.\n\nWhile there may not have been a proper sandstorm, [MGY.GetCapital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] was still buffeted by the desert surrounding it. With a small titter, Rarity brushed herself off a bit further and felt her cheeks turn a bright red. "We've been here for the last few minutes, haven't we?" When everypony else nodded, Rarity tittered, "Oh dear."\n\nSwitching her gaze between her friends, she let out another, small giggle as she followed in last, the heat of the city giving way to a somewhat cooler interior. Although humble, the counter and seats inside the cafe were partly full, and she gasped when she spotted a familiar pony. She grabbed Applejack. "P-P-Princess Luna!" she hissed as she shook her friend.\n\nAs if catching her name, Luna raised her head from her conversation with another pony Rarity recognized, Somnambula, and she pushed her chair back. She approached the group of friends, a storm brewing on her face. When she reached them, she huffed, "Ye tarried." She nickered. "Come. There is much which we must discuss."\n\nSomnambula had followed Luna's walk, and she gave a wave to the ponies. "I wish she bore good news, friends," Somnambula quipped. Although she carried a smile, Rarity could spot lines that indicated she was forcing it. Her eyes didn't glow with any level of emotion.\n\nAs she released Applejack, Rarity readjusted her mane again and she glanced at the counter. A rotund stallion had already begun filling five fresh mugs with steaming coffee, and the aromatic flavors filled the cafe. Luna had already begun walking back, but she grabbed the mugs as they were filled with her magic, and slid them to empty places at the table.\n\nWhen all had gathered, Luna steepled her hooves together. She eyed each of them solemnly. As she was silhouetted against the windows looking out into the worsening storm, she looked like little more than a dark form with glittering mane.\n\nAfter sighing once more, she grunted, "We are powerless. [ROOT.GetLeader] has refused to promise aid, and without Twilight—" She swallowed "—we are on our own."\n\nRarity folded her ears against her head, and she gulped."

  ###Corruption Events###
  solarreworked.200.t:0 "Student Transfer"
  solarreworked.200.d:0 ""Are there yet?" Flurry Heart whined as she followed after Daybreaker. Around her and Daybreaker, a number of guards kept pace, although far enough away that it wouldn't appear as if they were listening. She wrinkled her nose. With a soft hum, she glanced to and fro between some of the newer skyscrapers in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Ahead of her, Daybreaker gave a small sigh.\n\n"Flurry, my niece," Daybreaker stated. She turned to Flurry, revealing a forced grin. "You asked the same question nary three minutes ago."\n\n"Now you sound like Auntie Luna," Flurry interjected with a giggle. As her short mane bobbed with her suppressed laughter, Daybreaker's fiery hair burst into a blue flame. However, she remained silent. The closer guards stopped and anxiously held onto their rifles.\n\nSpreading her smile wide, Daybreaker cheerfully declared, "Might I suggest, my niece, that we continue? There is much to be done."\n\n"Okay!" Flurry exclaimed and started to prance past Daybreaker. Furrowing her brow, Daybreaker ignited her horn and snatched Flurry, who let out a small gasp and struggled to escape the field of magic. As her wings spread out, nearly connecting with Daybreaker's muzzle, Flurry yelped, "Hey! Let me go! Unless we're going to play a game! Is it hide and seek?!"\n\nDaybreaker gritted her teeth.\n\nSetting Flurry down, she motioned to the city. "No. Instead, you will listen and learn." She arched a brow. "Your aunt Twilight has told me that you like learning." At Flurry's innocuous stare, she smirked. After gesturing again at the city, specifically the ponies visible on other streets, who all avoided Daybreaker as best they could, she inquired, "What do you see?"\n\n"Ponies," Flurry stated. She tilted her head. "Why? Do you see something different?" She gasped. "Oh! Are we going to make friends like Auntie Twilight does?" Her wings flapped excitedly. Despite her being older and taller, they still were too large for her.\n\nAs they sent a weak air current toward Daybreaker, Daybreaker simply shook her head. "No, Flurry, they are mortals. They are but brief gusts of wind." Flurry inclined her head further. Pacing toward Flurry, Daybreaker sat down and stared directly at Flurry. Some rays of sunlight danced directly on Flurry's head, almost making it look like a crown. "Your mother and tutor were misguided. Harmony isn't through friendship alone. It's through Order. Through obedience." At that, Daybreaker's eyes flashed. "And you will learn every last one of my words.""
  solarreworked.200.a:0 "You have much to unlearn."
  solarreworked.201.t:0 "Imperial Judgement"
  solarreworked.201.d:0 ""Fire!"\n\nAs a series of loud gunshots echoed across the open court of the Imperial Palace's exterior, Flurry Heart flinched and covered her eyes with her wings. Shrinking back at the spurts of blood that shot from the chests of the ponies who had been lined up against a wall, she whimpered and began to shiver. In her mind's eye, she could still see one of the ponies try to get on their knees to plead, and then they had been hit by the butt of a rifle. Even from where she sat with Daybreaker, she heard the crunch of bone and saw the stallion's jaw jerk out of alignment.\n\nWhile she sniffled, soft feathers rested on her back, and she poked her head out of her makeshift cocoon. As she did, more feathers brushed the few tears she had from her cheeks. She snuffled and choked.\n\n"What's wrong, Flurry?" Daybreaker inquired as she pulled back one of her wings. She used it to indicate the line of soldiers dragging away the dead. Despite the sunny conditions, the courtyard appeared dark and foreboding as shadows stretched into it from all angles.\n\n"W-W-Why are they being shot?" She coughed and sniffed again. Her bottom lip quivering, she gazed deeply into Daybreaker's eyes and mumbled, "I don't understand, Auntie Celestia. W-What's going on?"\n\nFor a moment, Daybreaker visually evaluated Flurry, casting her eyes up and down her niece. Although her lips had been a firm line before she sighed. "These ponies were criminals. One set fire to a barracks, another stole from the Imperial warehouses, a third distributed counterfeit bits." She paused. "There are more, but, I would rather ask you, Flurry. What would you do?"\n\n"Show them mercy," Flurry answered in a heartbeat. Sitting straighter, she brushed her nose with a hoof. She winced at the trail left behind. "Let them have another chance."\n\nAt that, Daybreaker clicked her tongue and shook her head. "These ponies were not new criminals. They would repeat again." She sighed and hung her shoulders. "We must lead by example, Flurry. As alicorns, ponies look to us. If we do not punish sin, then are we perfectly just?"\n\nFlurry licked her lips. "But—"\n\n"No! There is no 'but'!" Daybreaker's mane flashed blue. Barely curling her lip upward, she growled, "If we do not keep Order, ponies will degenerate into animals. They will become greedy cowards." Staring at the soldiers who had returned, she evenly stated, "We are ponykind's strength. We make the hard decisions. We make the sacrifices so that everypony can prosper." She glanced at Flurry. "Is that clear?"\n\nNervously, Flurry fell back against her seat as more prisoners were brought out. "I suppose."\n\nDaybreaker smirked."
  solarreworked.201.a:0 "You'll catch on soon enough."
  solarreworked.202.t:0 "Living Dead"
  solarreworked.202.d:0 "Like a punch to the gut, Flurry's breath was knocked from her as she stepped into one of the cathedrals in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Golden beams of light poured through the towering windows, reflecting off the marble, glossed white paint, and gold that gilded the entirety of the ceiling. An artistic fresco of Daybreaker descending to Equus, fire following her, had been lovingly inlaid into the roof.\n\nFlurry scratched at her neck. Glancing down, she frowned at the blue fur she had. Likewise, her wing joints felt itchy, and she couldn't even touch them, since her wings were invisible. She glanced over at an older mare, slightly taller than her, who was a brilliant white and orange. She leaned over. "Can we ditch these disguise spells already? It's getting uncomfortable."\n\nThe mare glared at her. "You will sit silently and listen." At that, she led Flurry to a pew, where a couple of other ponies had already sat down, and they waited. Flurry shifted in her spot. As she kicked her hindlegs around, the mare lightly smacked her withers. "Enough, niece! It shall start soon."\n\nFlicking one of her ears, Flurry observed the two ponies in her pew lean forward and pray, and she hummed. "Why are they doing that?" she asked to the mare.\n\nThere was a spark of yellow in the mare's eyes, and she grinned. "You asked early." She tittered. "They are renewing their vow to me." Staring at a priestess of the Solaris Cultus that emerged from a back room, she whispered, "Many of these ponies are prepared to die for me. I am prepared to use it, as must you. Order must be spread. My ponies are the tools that will do so."\n\n"But what if they die?" Flurry inquired, her heart skipping a couple of beats. She nibbled on a forehoof. Eyeing the two ponies, she muttered, "They seem nice. I don't want them hurt."\n\n"And hurt they will be if you hesitate!" Daybreaker, in disguise, hissed. At that, Flurry's heart twisted and felt like it was going through a wringer. While some sweat started to trickle down Flurry's neck, Daybreaker added, "If we are not prepared to protect—and use—every one of our ponies, then what use is an alicorn? Yes, some will perish, but our actions will save many more." She arched a brow. "Or would you rather have Harmony be crushed by the likes of Chrysalis, the Storm King, Tirek, or others?"\n\nFlurry wilted.\n\n"Would you condemn millions to suffer for your selfishness?" When Flurry was silent, she huffed, "I thought not." With an inviting smile, she asked, "Now, do you have more questions?"\n\n"One." Flurry inhaled. "How do I lead them?" At that, Daybreaker sneered."
  solarreworked.202.a:0 "Now you are beginning to see wisdom."
  solarreworked.203.t:0 "Ascend"
  solarreworked.203.d:0 "A cold chill ran down Daybreaker's spine as she watched Flurry Heart twist and whirl through some of her training exercises. Dodge, weave, unleash magic bolt, repeat. Every single one of her targets, various prisoners from rebel camps that had yet to be properly dealt with, fell to her advances. Despite her lithe form, which belied some of her innate, alicorn strength, she dove at one of the nearby, fleeing ponies, who was banging on the door out of the training room.\n\nAs a chime of magic echoed through the arena, there was an agonizing screech, and then it went silent. Slowly, the lights to the room dimmed, and there was a single, light click as the latch to the door was released, by a simple twist by Daybreaker's magic.\n\nIn a burst of light, Daybreaker teleported to the other side of the door, and opened it, revealing Flurry, who was heaving over the charred body of the rebel. She continued to stare at it for a moment, emotions running rampant in her eyes, switching rapidly between rage, confusion, anger, hurt, fear, and shock. While her breaths continued in staccato bursts, she finally got off of the body and staggered on wobbly legs toward Daybreaker.\n\n"You succeeded," Daybreaker stated matter-of-factly. Masking a fake yawn by placing a hoof over her muzzle, she concealed a grin as Flurry collapsed in a heap in front of her.\n\n"I—I—I—" she stammered a few times.\n\n"You succeeded," repeated Daybreaker, stepping forward and resting a hoof on Flurry's shoulder. The young mare looked at Daybreaker, tears welling up as she gazed into her aunt's eyes. "You did not hesitate. You took charge. Like an alicorn must." At Flurry's nod, she smiled. "Tell me: what did you feel?"\n\n"I... felt... furious. Everypony there was a danger to [EQS.GetNameDef]. A danger to you! To me!" At that, Flurry pushed herself back up. "I-If they could coordinate, they could have attacked you!" Realization clearly dawning on her, the dam of emotions broke and she sobbed, "I can't let them hurt you! I can't let them hurt me!" Only a couple of sniffs escaped her nose before she screamed, "I'll break them all!"\n\nAs Flurry wailed, Daybreaker smirked.\n\nShe had finally learned."

  solarreworked.204.t:0 "Hard Knocks"
  solarreworked.204.d:0 "Soaked to the skin in sweat, Nova Heart spread her wings and catapulted herself into the air to avoid a blistering stream of fire headed her way. Nary a second later, one of the prefabricated buildings which had been erected for her training exam exploded in a shower of sparks and embers. As she was peppered by debris from the former field armory, she cast a hasty teleport spell and appeared a few feet away.\n\nShe heaved rapidly. While her chest burned, she cast her gaze around the dark battlefield. It had been created a few miles outside of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and a simulated attack on her theoretical base camp had been ongoing for hours. What heretic prisoners she had for soldiers had all been immolated over time, despite how efficiently or ruthlessly she utilized them. In her head, she ran through different scenarios, tactics that could be used, but she was quickly running up on empty.\n\nIn the dim light, she caught a brief flash of fire and movement, and she swallowed and prepared a spell. As she did, the voice of her aunt echoed across the field. "Come now, Nova, that's too predictable an attack. Where is that Sparkle brain of yours?"\n\n"Show yourself!" Nova spat, whirling around as she thought she heard another noise. "This is far from fair!"\n\n"But war isn't fair, Nova," called Daybreaker from elsewhere. Nova whipped back to the source of the noise. "I am merely using this terrain, these conditions to my advantage."\n\n"And I DIDN'T?!" Nova retorted, her voice cracking at the end as she furiously glared into the dark. "I had intel of the attack: I ordered my troops into protected positions. Y-You cheated, or something!"\n\nThere was another crack, and Nova darted to the side as a bolt of flame nearly impacted her. Facing the direction of the shot, she saw nothing. Her heart beating rapidly, her mind tried to place herself in Daybreaker's shoes.\n\nShe was being backed into a corner. Daybreaker was incredibly self-confident. She had an ego. If Nova had nowhere to flee, then—\n\nSpinning on her heels, she fell onto her back, and avoided a flying tackle and finishing maneuver from Daybreaker, whose flaming hooves barely missed impacting Nova in the chest. Before Daybreaker could fully recover from the landing, Nova surged upward, and placed her horn's pointed tip directly into the neck of Daybreaker, with enough pressure to lightly press into the flesh.\n\nDaybreaker froze, and then grinned. "You thought like your foe. Excellent."\n\n"Checkmate, Auntie," Nova growled before collapsing in exhaustion onto the cold dirt."

  solarreworked.205.d:0 "Encapsulated in one of the specially-designed dungeons of the castle in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Sunset Shimmer sulked on her cot within her cell. Trying to escape with magic was useless, as this had clearly been created to hold powerful mages. Although faint, the memory of Celestia stating as much, and about how they were almost never used, returned to her mind. As soon as it did, her throat caught and she choked back a couple of sniffs.\n\nIt didn't also help that her horn had been locked down with an inhibitor ring.\n\nShe flicked her ear when a scratching on the door's lock caught her attention. On the other side of the bars, two guards, dressed in full parade uniform, stood on either side, while a third unlatched the door. Seconds later, he stepped away, and Sunset's throat latched itself shut.\n\nEntering the room with a confident sashay, Daybreaker performed a cursory inspection of the cell, and then looked to Sunset. "Hello, my long lost—"\n\n"No!" Sunset interjected, shaking her head and crawling back a few paces. "Don't even say that! You aren't Celestia! Don't even try!"\n\nA pained frown fell upon Daybreaker's muzzle, and she shook her head. "My dearest Sunset, I'm just as much her as she is me." Stepping forward, she reached out a forehoof to cup one of Sunset's cheeks, although it was quickly batted away as Sunset retreated further into the cell. Daybreaker didn't pursue. Rather, she arched an eyebrow. "Tell me, why did you not return earlier to help me?"\n\n"I didn't come to help you!" Sunset barked back. Although she managed to keep a straight face, her chest burned with emotion, and she blinked back tears. "I came to help Equestria! To help Twilight!"\n\n"Oh, yes, Twilight." Daybreaker grinned. "But not for me? If so, then why did it take a war to bring you? If you cared more for my Empire and for Twilight, what was preventing you from volunteering for their sake sooner?"\n\n"I—"\n\n"I think that it is more than that, and we're going to spend a bit of time determining what." Again, Daybreaker stepped forward, her radiant mane illuminating the entire cell as she did so. When she was only a few feet away, Sunset attempted to dart past her, but Daybreaker merely grabbed her in a telekinetic field. "Come, my long lost student, I think it's time we aired our grievances.""

  solarreworked.206.t:0 "The Rebellious Daughter"
  solarreworked.206.d:0 ""Tell me, Sunset, what truly motivated you?" Daybreaker inquired as she sat Sunset down on her cot. With a look of concern, she stood over the unicorn, and motioned for her guards to close the door. It latched with a click. "You were always so ambitious, yet, driven by emotion." Cracking a smirk, she added, "I recall when you attempted to break into one of the—"\n\n"Shut up!" Sunset bellowed as she flattened her ears against her skull and spun away from Daybreaker. "Those aren't your memories! Y-You're just trying to get into my head!" Despite her emphatic declaration, a couple of tears managed to trickle down her muzzle. "There's nothing you can say that will make me believe you!"\n\n"Then how about this?" Daybreaker inquired. She stepped back. As if reflecting a calmer state of mind, her mane's steady, rhythmic waving in an ethereal wind slowed, and the bright orange flame darkened to a blood red. Placing a hoof to her peytral, Daybreaker stated, "I forgive you."\n\nSunset jerked her head around. Although she didn't say anything, Daybreaker could see some of the fire leave her eyes. In return, a spark of curiosity was quickly extinguished by a renewed anger, and Sunset crossed her forehooves and looked away again.\n\n"You heard correctly, Sunset Shimmer, my former student." Since Sunset didn't cut her off, Daybreaker bared her fangs in a sneer and stated, "Just like I forgive all those who truly repent of their rebellion against me."\n\n"Yes, because THAT'S happened so far."\n\n"Do you think me a monster, Sunset?" Daybreaker glanced over her shoulder as she trotted to the one, small window looking out of the cell into the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. "Am I so different from you? From everything Twilight told me, did you not decide you knew what was best for those creatures on the other side of the portal? Did you listen to their needs? Did you understand their wants?"\n\nSunset's expression darkened. "What I did was wrong! I controlled them! Forced them to do my bidding!"\n\n"Ah, but some followed you willingly, did they not? Is that no different from what I must do? Ponies do not always know what is best for them, yet they can be convinced to follow those who do. If you were to go free, would you fight against every one that believes in me? How many would you have to kill to declare that 'evil' has been defeated?"\n\nDaybreaker turned and leaned toward Sunset. "How many until you felt accepted?""
  solarreworked.206.a:0 "Your heart is laid bare, Sunset."
  solarreworked.207.t:0 "The Prodigal Daughter"
  solarreworked.207.d:0 ""If you were to battle your way through every one of my loyal subjects, what then?" As Daybreaker effectively leered over Sunset, Sunset's posture slumped, and she started to work her jaw nervously. Instead of defiance or anger, her ears were pressed against her head in despair. Steady tears trickled down her muzzle and stained the simple sheets of the cot.\n\nSitting down to be at eye level with Sunset, Daybreaker gently reached underneath Sunset's chin and pulled it up. Sunset's eyes met with hers momentarily, then Sunset jerked away again. Still, the unicorn was clearly fighting back sobs, and she pulled her forelegs close to her chest before scooting back on the bed.\n\n"No answer?" prodded Daybreaker. Closing her eyes, she sighed, "If you were to defeat me? Where would that lead you? Would ponies accept you? Would they see that you did what you did for 'their good'? Would you not simply be imposing your will on them, like you did with the creatures beyond the portal?"\n\n"No... I... would do it out of... love for them." Sunset wiped at her nose.\n\n"And you think I do not love them?" For a second time, the cocky grin that was on Daybreaker's muzzle broke and she solemnly gazed at Sunset. "Do you not think I do this all for them? Am I not the one who is protecting them? From Chrysalis, or [STG.GetLeader], [WNG.GetLeader], Sombra, Tirek, or others? From themselves?"\n\n"I..."\n\nDaybreaker stretched out a hoof. As her reach was far longer, she was able to pull Sunset toward her, and soon pressed her into a tight embrace. Wrapping her wings around Sunset, she stated, "Sunset, my Sunset, you do not have to keep fighting. You do not have to keep seeking approval, whether from Twilight, Equestria, or anypony else. You have a home here.\n\n"You can choose to protect Harmony, like I do for my ponies. You can be accepted for who you are. You don't have to keep wandering, thinking only of your guilt." Daybreaker gently ran a forehoof up and down Sunset's back. "Did you not express how you wished the family you never had back in Tall Tale? You can have that here. You can have all of that, if you help me shield Equestria and Harmony from danger."\n\nSuddenly, whatever was holding Sunset back shattered, and she began sobbing into Daybreaker's fur. As the broken mare's tears soaked Daybreaker's skin, Daybreaker's muzzle twisted into a self-satisfied grin."
  solarreworked.207.a:0 "You have come home, Sunset Shimmer."
  solarreworked.208.t:0 "Arise"
  solarreworked.208.d:0 ""I—" Sunset Shimmer began, before her words choked on her tears and she buried her head further into Daybreaker's chest. Gripping one limply onto Daybreaker's other foreleg, she attempted to force back a few coughs and sputters, while Daybreaker continued to shush her while rubbing her back. "I just want... everypony to be safe."\n\n"As do I, Sunset, yet what you thought was the right way would only lead them into more danger. Do you not see that now?" Daybreaker inquired, momentarily leaving the warm hug and wiping away a couple of Sunset's tears. "Do you not see that ponies like us must guide them to safe pastures, whether they agree with it or not?"\n\nWith Sunset's silence, barring the uneasy working of her jaw, Daybreaker clicked her tongue like a chiding, concerned mother, and pulled Sunset back into the embrace. "You do not have to fight any longer. Your journey has come to an end. You're home. Truly home."\n\n"B-But what you want... it isn't me... it's my past. My past isn't my today. I—" Sunset coughed and choked again, before a few hiccups racked her body. With a comforting "shhh," Daybreaker began to softly play her wings along Sunset's back and head. Slowly, the sobs came to a stop, and Sunset stammered, "W-What can be done?"\n\n"You will assist me. You will help everypony who aids me."\n\nLeaving the embrace, Daybreaker stood and patiently left a forehoof out for Sunset to take. Sunset eyed it sullenly, then reached for it. She paused for a second. One last, weak flame of resistance flashed in her eyes, then she sighed. In defeat, she wrapped one of her own forehooves around Daybreaker, and wobbingly stood up.\n\n"I don't know what—"\n\n"Don't say anything, Sunset. You will make me proud." Daybreaker clamped a wing on Sunset's shoulder. "But from henceforth, you are a new pony. Together, Dawnbreak Shimmer, you and I shall preserve Harmony." She squeezed tighter on Sunset's shoulder. "You are home.""
  solarreworked.208.a:0 "Welcome back, my prodigal daughter."
  solarreworked.209.d:0 ""I... I... No!" Twilight screamed as she slammed the marble floor of the throne room repeatedly with her hoof. Each successive impact slowly weakened, and she whimpered more loudly in tandem. "I wouldn't! I would never! I would be helping them! F-Freeing them! From—" Twilight cut herself off in a couple of sniffs. From where Daybreaker stood, now again impassive and observing her former student, she could see tears glistening in the light streaming in through the stained glass windows.\n\n"But you would," Daybreaker emphasized, keeping her voice calm and collected as she sauntered ever nearer to Twilight. What little bit of fire that had reignited itself within Twilight was quickly flickering and perishing. It would only take a little push to snuff it out permanently.\n\nNow only a couple of inches away from her, Daybreaker simply stated, "Twilight."\n\nFor a moment, Twilight didn't look up, but when she did, her eyes were bloodshot, and she blinked a few times as Daybreaker's mane reflected in her pupils. Dark tracts had been carved into her fur where her tears had stained them. With every passing second, fear, pain, and confusion grew more evident upon the young alicorn's face.\n\nDaybreaker shook her, like a doting mother. "Twilight, Twilight, Twilight. My faithful student." She reassuringly placed a hoof upon Twilight's head, and Twilight flinched. However, with her chains keeping her in place, she could only whine a couple of times while Daybreaker applied a smidgen more pressure for comfort. Daybreaker sighed. "Did you know that you were my pride? I could always count upon you to the correct thing. To put Harmony above all else."\n\n"I... I..."\n\n"Yet you're continuing to fight against Harmony's will." Daybreaker traced her hoof to be below Twilight's chin, and craned it up so they were looking at each other. "You're lost. Confused. The answers you seek are here. You must simply open your eyes." Warmly smiling, she leaned down slightly and nuzzled Twilight.\n\nTwilight winced, but she asked, "H-How can anypony be helped?"\n\nHer grin expanding further, Daybreaker used her magic to unlatch the chains, and extended a hoof to help Twilight stand. "By leading by example. By showing them what true Harmony is. By guiding them in my Order."\n\nCowering back from Daybreaker's hoof temporarily, Twilight hesitantly took it, and raised herself to her hooves. "What about ponies who don't want to follow?"\n\nDaybreaker's eyes flashed with fire. "Then they shall be enlightened. And you shall enlighten them, Sunrise Sparkle.""

  solarreworked.210.d:0 ""Ah, Cadance, what a pleasure for you to agree to my summons." Without looking away from the book that she was reading, Daybreaker motioned for Cadance to enter her quarters. Practically being shoved in by a couple of guards, Cadance grunted and flared her wings aggressively, however, she could do little in account of inhibitor ring placed around her horn.\n\nDaybreaker smirked.\n\n"It wasn't like I had much choice," Cadance grumbled as her wings folded back against her sides. Looking up at her horn, she snarled, "Although I'm surprised that they're keeping me in here alone, when I could use this—"\n\n"Please, it's not in your nature. Besides—" Daybreaker forced back a yawn as she put away her book. A book on relational advice. "—I could easily incinerate you where you stand before you could think." Quirking her lips upward in a sneer, she tittered, "So don't try it."\n\n"Did you call me here, just to make fun of me?! Aren't you happy enough, corrupting Celestia like you did?! Haven't you already made Harmony a mockery?" As a lock of her mane fell in front of her face, Cadance growled. "Didn't you already make your point clear when you 'visited' us?"\n\n"Can't an aunt want to spend more time with her niece?" Daybreaker countered, visibly brushing off every accusation with a dismissive wave of a forehoof. Stepping around her desk, Daybreaker practically stalked forward, her eyes glowing in interest. "Should I not wish for us to mend our relationship?"\n\n"Never!" spat Cadance. With each advance Daybreaker made, she retreated in kind, and occasionally checked her back to ensure she wouldn't be cornered. "You're a monster! You're no better than Sombra!"\n\nAt that, Daybreaker paused, and she shook her head and tsked. Pain on her face, Daybreaker inquired, "Do you really think that of me?" Cadance's glower was all that Daybreaker needed. "I suppose you do. What do you propose, Cady?"\n\n"Don't call me that! You don't have a right to—"\n\n"I am your aunt!" Pressing a forehoof onto her chest, Daybreaker stepped forward again, a hurt expression on her muzzle. "I do what I must for my ponies out of love, yet YOU have the gall to call me the monster! Tell me, Mi Amore Cadenza, do you feel like YOU are sinless?"\n\n"D-Don't you dare twist—"\n\n"Perhaps you will listen to reason.""
  solarreworked.210.a:0 "Who's the real monster?"
  solarreworked.211.t:0 "The Misguided Niece"
  solarreworked.211.d:0 ""Tell me, Mi Amore Cadenza," Daybreaker hurled at Cadance, emphasizing each syllable with a harsh snarl, "If you were to set my Empire 'free,' what would it involve?" Assessing Cadance, she watched as Cadance took another couple of steps backward, but bumped quickly into the wall of Daybreaker's quarters. "If I am such a monster, what would it involve to rid my ponies of myself? Would my ponies even want that?"\n\n"I-I know there must!" Cadance pursed her lips. However, between the wall and the narrowing distance between her and Daybreaker, she didn't really have room to flee. "There will always be ponies who fight against tyrants like you!"\n\n"'Tyrants?'" Daybreaker inquired, her eyes flashing with curiosity. Stopping and standing straight, she tilted her head and repeated, "'Tyrants,' hmm? What if I'm not seen as a tyrant? What if I'm adored? What if ponies follow me out of the strength I provide and the protection I offer? What then?"\n\nCadance bit her lip. Advancing closer still, Daybreaker prodded with a matronly tone, "What then, Cadance?"\n\n"Y-You'd be controlling them! Through fear, or, or through magic, or—"\n\n"I lead through power!" Briefly, Daybreaker's mane flashed a brighter, hotter blue, and she bared her teeth, but it quickly faded. "What makes you believe that my ponies have been coerced? As you arrived, you must have seen how they praise me. Would that do that with you, if you overthrew me?"\n\n"I never—"\n\n"Would you earn their support, or would you have to force them to love you? What would you do if you large groups refused to follow you? Would you strike them down for stability? Would you enchant them to long for your orders? Is that not what Sombra would have done?" Daybreaker's expression grew dourer. As a couple of tears started to glisten in Cadance's eyes, Daybreaker got within hoof's reach. Reaching out and forward with a wing, she gently touched Cadance's shoulder and asked, "Would he not have forced everypony to follow him, whether they wanted to or not?"\n\n"I... that's not..."\n\n"But you would have to. Destroying me would lead to destruction of Equestria and Harmony. What then?" When Cadance remained silent, Daybreaker withdrew her wing and turned. She heard Cadance slump to the floor, and grinned."
  solarreworked.211.a:0 "What else, my niece?"
  solarreworked.212.t:0 "The Selfish Niece"
  solarreworked.212.d:0 "As she marched to the balcony in her room, Daybreaker caught a few quiet whimpers from Cadance. She kept herself faced away. Inhaling some of the fresh air that gently blew off the balcony, she stared out at [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and sighed. "Cadance, you DO realize that my ponies would move the world for me?  I am their strength and shield. I am Harmony and Order, perfected. If you were to kill me, or overthrow me, whether you established yourself, Luna, or another on the throne, you would never be loved."\n\nCadance choked back a sob. With a sputter, she hissed, "They'd... they'd see that I was doing it for them?"\n\n"And my actions are not in their best interest? If you went down into the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Ponyville, Vanhoover, or others, would you find somepony who believed I wasn't for their best?" Stretching forth a hoof to swipe through the air in order to indicate the capital, Daybreaker looked back at Cadance. Cadance was in a heap, barely able to sit as a few tears dripped onto the marble floor tiles. Streaks of mascara trickled down her cheeks, but she managed to keep from weeping outright.\n\nRotating back, Daybreaker inquired, "I knew that you didn't wish to come here. If you strike me down, perhaps you would take it. But what then? In this world where I am no longer, what would you do? What would you say?" Daybreaker lowered her head slightly. As a sneer formed on her muzzle, she inquired, "What would you say to Flurry?"\n\n"Don't—"\n\n"Oh, but I shall." Daybreaker spun. With heavy hoofbeats toward Cadance, she marched back, and stood tall over her niece. Yet concern laced her words. "Because one day, she will ask why ponies in Equestria whisper behind the monarchy's back, or why resentment is palpable in the streets. Or, if you make everypony love you, why nopony seems natural. Why they will do whatever is asked, no matter how inane. How would you tell her you were the one to create this suffering? Would you tell her it was solely because you believed that I was the monster?"\n\nCadance didn't reply. At first, she merely looked at the floor. Seconds passed and silenced reigned. Then, the floodgates crumbled."
  solarreworked.212.a:0 "Would you want that for her?"
  solarreworked.213.t:0 "Bleeding Heart"
  solarreworked.213.d:0 "Carefully descending onto her knees, Daybreaker stared at Cadance for a moment as the other alicorn sniffled and whimpered. Clear puddles of tears slowly expanded while Cadance shivered and quaked as she was racked with sobs, yet Daybreaker simply watched. A faint smirk touched the edge of her mouth, and she reached out a hoof to rest on Cadance's shoulder.\n\nWith a small gasp, Cadance's crying momentarily halted, and she looked to Daybreaker; her eyes gleamed, and a few of the faint blood vessels within slowly growing redder with each passing moment. She worked her jaw a couple of times, but could only cough out a couple of letters.\n\n"There's no need to fight," Daybreaker finally stated, placing a bit more pressure on Cadance's shoulder. "You care for your ponies, and my own, as much as I do. You have only been misled. Dogmatic beliefs that have no place in the modern era." Her expression hardened slightly. "Order gives rise to Harmony. Only through it can ponies hope to remain safe, secure, and free." Cadance still remained silent.\n\nTenderly letting out a coo, much like a mother would with a daughter, Daybreaker moved closer, and nuzzled Cadance's head briefly. Some of Cadance's tears stained Daybreaker's fur, but she brushed them quickly off before continuing, "Our ponies need guidance. They still live in fear. There are still enemies ahoof." She gazed directly into Cadance's eyes. "They need assurance and stability. They need somepony who can encourage them to find fellowship in each other, no matter how trying the times. They need a strong role model of the modern Imperial family."\n\nWithdrawing from the quasi-embrace, she rested a hoof on Cadance's chest before declaring, "They need somepony like you."\n\n"I-I can't. They can't if they see me—"\n\n"They will LOVE you, Cadance. And just like how I care for you, you will care for them." A small sneer, sinister and foreboding, crawled upon Daybreaker's muzzle. "And those that do not wish to listen, they will be provided correction.""

  solarreworked.214.t:0 "The Protege's Protege"
  solarreworked.214.d:0 ""I want to talk to Spike." Daybreaker turned from a couple of nobles to whom she was speaking in the throne room at the declaration. Arching a brow, she watched Sunrise Sparkle march into the room, flanked by a hoofful of soldiers who were meticulously dressed in parade uniform. Nothing but perfection, like their mistress wanted.\n\n"Do you now?" inquired Daybreaker, briefly looking to the nobles and waving them off with a hoof. As both bowed and departed hastily between Sunrise's procession, Daybreaker calmly stalked toward her Lady Inquisitor. "And why is that?" She eyed Sunrise. "Feeling remorse? Guilt? Loneliness?"\n\n"None, my Empress," Sunrise replied, stiffening and staring straight ahead. In her eyes, the brilliant beams of color from the various stained-glass windows in the throne room reflected like a kaleidoscope. Sunrise's gaze grew colder. "He is useful."\n\n"How?"\n\nStartled, Sunrise blinked a couple of times before she stated, "H-He has been a valuable assistant to me before... I was enlightened. He knows how I think. He can point out details I sometimes miss."\n\nDaybreaker hummed. Wrinkling her brow, she got within a few inches of Sunrise's face and stared her down. Nothing she could see hinted at anything behind Sunrise's motives. She stepped back. "You usher him into my Order as well? Would your time not be better spent extracting information from prisoners?" She curled her lip upward. "There are always threats that could topple Harmony."\n\n"Perhaps, Empress, but I believe I will work more efficiently with him. Besides, I believe I will be the only one who can get through to him." For a second, her eyes flashed with excitement, and it was long enough that Daybreaker discerned the change in her mood.\n\nStepping to one of the nearby motes of lava gently meandering through the throne room, Daybreaker beckoned Sunrise. "Sunrise, I feel you are not being entirely truthful."\n\nAt that, Sunrise bit her lip and she exhaled, "I-I suppose I DO want some company."\n\n"Am I not enough? Are not all those who follow me sufficient?"\n\n"Of course! But we are like siblings! I miss him. I want him to know what I know." Sunrise's eyes sparkled excitedly. Breaking decorum, she grabbed one of Daybreaker's forehooves, and declared, "Imagine how great a team we could be if we worked together! I just want to give it a try! I-If he doesn't accept, then—" She sighed. "He can be dealt with as a rebel."\n\nSmiling, Daybreaker nodded. "Very well. You have one chance."\n\nWith a whinny of glee, Sunrise let go and trotted off, and Daybreaker hid a titter."

  solarreworked.215.d:0 "Casting his gaze around nervously, Spike took in the resplendent marble and gleaming gold that lined the castle in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], making the room that he was kept in appear like it was the middle of the day, despite the now-waning sunlight of the evening. Two stallions, dressed in military uniform, and glowing with fire-retardant enchantments, stood on either side of him. Neither met his gaze.\n\nWhat he was doing in the castle was still beyond him. When he was separated from Twilight, he had been left in one of the cells of the castle, and basically ignored since then. Aside from the same meal of a single, low-quality gem, and numerous, almost inedible sandwiches, he had been left alone. Nopony had shown him any interest.\n\nTo say that his mind was racing, knowing that Daybreaker could very well be finally dealing with him, would be an understatement. Yet, between the guards, his chains, and the locked room, there was no easy way out. All he could do was count rubies and hope. Maybe Daybreaker was feeling lenient.\n\nHeart skipping a beat when he heard a latch on the door, he forced back a breath when a young alicorn trotted through the door. Stuttering anxiously as soon as she laid eyes on him, he exclaimed, "Twilight?!"\n\nImmediately, Twilight galloped toward Spike and she pulled him into an embrace, wrapping her wings gently around him. "Spike!" she choked out, as he felt a tear or two trickle down her muzzle onto his scales. "I missed you!" It only took a second or two for him to return the hug, and she coughed some tears. However, they didn't stay like that for long, as Twilight looked up and nodded.\n\n"You're dismissed," she stated solemnly, even if there was still a hint of lingering emotion in her voice.\n\nThe stallions saluted, and one declared, "As you command, Lady Inquisitor."\n\nAs they marched out of the room, Spike's brain replayed what he heard. "'Lady Inquisitor?'" he asked. His eyes started to sting. Details that had been unnoticed in his elation at seeing Twilight began to pop out. Her fur was lighter, her mane now only had a single, blood-red streak in it, and her cutie mark...\n\nIt was blinding.\n\n"Yes, Spike," Twilight replied with a nod. "I serve Equestria now."\n\n"Y-You mean Daybreaker!" he retorted, jabbing a claw at her. At Twilight's confusion, he snapped, "W-What happened to friendship? Magic? Harmony?!"\n\nA sad smile twinging her muzzle, Twilight merely answered, "Oh, Spike, I guess I'll have to give you a few lessons.""

  solarreworked.216.d:0 ""What do I need to learn?! That you think Daybreaker's right?!" Spike barked, fruitlessly shoving back at Twilight. While it didn't move her far, she did take a few steps further back. Her eyes glistened with a fresh pain, although whether it was him, or something else, he couldn't say.\n\n"Spike."\n\n"No! This isn't you, Twilight! This is... this is whatever Daybreaker did to you!" Tapping on his head a couple of times with a claw, he added as his spines bristled, "You gotta snap out of it! M-Maybe it's some mind control magic, and you're in there, fighting, and you just need—"\n\n"Spike, this is me." Twilight drew both her wings up and down her front, indicating her entire appearance. With a cautious step toward him, she stated, "I'm still the pony you know." While she did smile, to him, it seemed fake. Perhaps it was the rapid speed she formed it, or the slightly too wide spread, or that her eyes weren't sparkling like they normally did when she was happy, but it rubbed him the wrong way.\n\nHe shivered. "N-No! You'd never help some crazy pony like Daybreaker! You didn't believe any of Chrysalis's lies when she impersonated Cadance! You saw through Cozy Glow's lies!" As warm rivulets of tears dribbled down his cheeks, he clasped both his hands together and implored, "Please, Twilight! You've gotta fight it!"\n\nTwilight's expression hardened. "Oh, Spike..." She shook her head. Drawing herself straighter, she looked back at the door, and powered her magic. It clicked tight, and the deadbolt fastened. "There's nothing to fight." With a small chuckle, she approached him and bent down. He bared his teeth, and she gently tapped him on the nose.\n\n"I'm helping preserve Order. Community! With them, we'll still have friendship and harmony." Her grin grew sinister. "It's just that a few eggs need to be cracked. There's danger in the world. You know that. [GRD.GetNameDef]? [WNG.GetNameDef]? [CHN.GetNameDef]? These and more." Holding up a hoof, she exclaimed, "Oh! Can't forget ponies within Equestria that endanger others."\n\n"By arresting them! What happened to tolerance and understanding? What about friendship?"\n\nSuppressing a giggle, Twilight stood straight and shook her head. "Spike, I have more friends now than I know what to do with! Everypony who helps the Empress is my friend!" She tilted her head. "Don't you want to still be my friend? My number one assistant?"\n\nAt those words, Spike felt as if a knife blade had been twisted into his gut."

  solarreworked.217.d:0 ""T-This can't be happening!" Spike clutched at his head as he sat back onto the floor. As he did, the chains that bound his legs together clinked and clattered, echoing throughout the room. What little sunlight there was left that came through the window looking out onto [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] made it appears as if the whole floor was on fire. The orange and red glow bounced back up to illuminate Twilight, who stared at Spike expectantly.\n\n"Y-You can't believe this! You overcame Discord! You stopped Tirek! Y-You reformed Starlight and Sunset! Y-Y-You can't just—" Whatever words were left in his throat died as a couple of hiccuping sobs escaped his lips. "J-Just stop it! S-Say this is all a ruse! You're pretending so that Daybreaker will slip up and—"\n\nWith a motherly clicking of her tongue, Twilight sat in front of Spike and rested a forehoof on one of his legs. He paused in his weeping for a second to stare deeply into her eyes. The same purple eyes that he had known for his entire life. Yet, they were foreign. Pain, love, but also anger. Enough to make him cower back as he continued to peer at her.\n\nWhen she saw his reaction, she tsked. Her voice and face darkening, she stated, "Of course, you COULD possibly escape. Maybe if you played a ruse and attacked me, you could render me unconscious. Possibly you could even find a way to take me out of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but what then, Spike? My purpose is higher than just making friends. It's preserving Harmony!" She curled a hoof triumphantly. After a second, she looked back at him. "I could use my number one assistant for that."\n\nShe smiled. Genuinely. "If you fled, you'd be alone, forever. Nopony could help you. They understand how to sacrifice for the greater Harmony." Inching closer to him, her voice grew quieter, more compassionate. "It's so hard to run my experiments without backup." She rolled her eyes. "Sure, the Empress gives me plenty of assistants, but—" She tapped his chest "—they aren't MY assistant."\n\nWhen Spike didn't respond, she let out a small whine and used her magic to pull him toward her. "Spike, I just want my little brother back. It can be like how things used to be." Spike's only answer were the tears staining her fur."

The months of separation had left his heart feeling raw, and although at first he had found Twilight's words too outlandish to believe, every statement slowly chipped away at his resolve. It was like a changeling was speaking out of a disguise. It was her vocabulary, her voice, her mannerisms. But it wasn't her! Was it?\n\nThrough it all, Twilight had been gently rubbing his spines, moving them back and forth to try and comfort him. Every so often, she hushed him soothingly, the same way that she would back before they first left Canterlot when he was nervous. Still, it wasn't her! At least, it wasn't who she was...\n\n"Spike, won't you help me?" she finally inquired, unlocking her chin from resting on his head. He gazed up at her, and saw a few tears trickling down her own muzzle. As a her mouth twisted into a frown, she muttered, "I just want to make sure you're safe. I want my number one assistant back."\n\nSpike coughed. Wiping at his eyes, he sniffed, "Y-Yeah, right. I-I've seen the castle halls. Ponies love her. It's like they're all mind-controlled." He grunted and furrowed his brow into a glower. "Y-You're no different! Y-You're just as mind controlled as the rest." However, his heart felt like it was being dragged down to Tartarus.\n\n"Spike!" Twilight exclaimed, her wings flaring back instinctively. She placed a hoof on her chest. "I love Daybreaker like everypony else! She's Harmony itself, how could I not? But... I still care about you! I still care about my friends!" Taking one of his claws in her hooves, she asked, "Won't you help me?!" The sinking sensation in his chest only increased, much like a whirlpool sucking debris into the Mareanis Trench.\n\nTwilight sighed. Hanging her head, she powered her horn and in a blink of magic, a stack of comic books appeared next to him. "I got you these. Found them in Manehattan." When he stared at them in shock, she added, "The initial printing of the first ten issues of the Power Ponies. All mint." There was a small note, stating it was "Sunrise's number one assistant."\n\nHis vision hazy, he asked, "Twilight?" She answered with a smile, and then the floodgates burst. Softly hiccuping, Spike leaned forward and into Twilight's embrace. The only thing he could do was nod.\n\nHe didn't see the grin twist into a sneer on Sunrise's muzzle."

However, none of it mattered to her. They were all just going about their lives, not even caring about the corruption that now ruled over them. If she wasn't focused on her target, her stomach would probably be roiling in disgust.\n\nFizzlepop Berrytwist barely registered the shadows and the dampness in the air of the city, though, as she trailed her next victim of vigilante justice. For months, she had remained low, only occasionally making visual contact and observations of the Militarium officer. From what she could tell, this mare was an analyst for some of the high command. At best, she could find some of the plans of Daybreaker's military, and then... do something.\n\nIt wasn't the most thought out, she had to admit, but she had been stuck in the city. When the Militarium had recalled all command staff, she had taken it as an opportunity to go to ground. There wasn't a way out of the Empire by now, but she could still cause damage from the inside.\n\nHer quarry rounded a corner, probably near her home, and Fizzlepop silently cantered to keep up. Poking her head around the side of the building, she ducked when a blast of magic nearly collided with her. It roared overhead, and Fizzlepop's horn crackled as she prepared a retaliation. How her target had determined she was being followed was a mystery, but Fizzlepop could figure that out later. At the moment, survival was key.\n\nAs she reacted too quickly, she didn't spot who had shot at her, but when she rolled out into the street, her horn's stub continuing to spark and snarl, she leapt up from her position and flew into flying kick. Her assaulter sidestepped, and Fizzlepop landed with a heavy thud on the cobblestone. She grunted and spun, whipping her other hindleg in an attempt to knock the assailant to the floor.\n\nInstead, the attacker jumped, and it was at that moment that Fizzlepop noticed the orange glow that had filled the street. As she took a second to catch her breath, her eyes widened and the icy tendrils of fear gripped her heart for the first time in years. Yet she steeled her jaw in defiance, and kept low, ready to pounce.\n\nHer assaulter stood across from her and towered over her. Boredom painted the mare's face. Fizzlepop swallowed hard.\n\n"Going somewhere?" Daybreaker inquired. A sneer revealed her fangs."

A single thought went through Fizzlepop's head. Had she been tricked? Had she been so foalish as to be lured into a trap? Where was her target? She couldn't have gotten far.\n\nTsking, Daybreaker shook her head and stated, "Don't think about it, Fizzy." She grinned wider when Fizzlepop slightly started at the nickname. "I merely want to—" Before she could finish, Fizzlepop catapulted like a coiled spring directly at Daybreaker's chest. Daybreaker rolled her eyes. "Ugh, you shouldn't interrupt your betters," she quipped while her horn lit up in a blood red glow.\n\nImmediately, Fizzlepop was halted in her flight. Flailing her legs about briefly, she struggled to break free of Daybreaker's hold, but without some way to break the spell, she was utterly helpless. For her part, Daybreaker pouted and set Fizzlepop down, although she kept a small sliver of energy around Fizzlepop's legs.\n\n"Such fire," she tittered. "I prefer that in ponies. It keeps them passionate." As she declared that, her mane briefly flickered a bright blue before settling back to its usual orange. Fizzlepop merely glared at her. Tilting her head, Daybreaker inquired, "Nothing to say?"\n\n"Not to despots like you," Fizzlepop snarled back.\n\n"Ah, but were you not the despot at one point?" Daybreaker countered. Fizzlepop inadvertently blushed. Chuckling again, Daybreaker added, "I thought so." Pacing back and forth in front of Fizzlepop, Daybreaker arched a brow and inquired, "You have been accepted in society, yet you wish to reject it again? Over what? Ideals? No..." She furrowed her brow.\n\n"Twilight asked me to—"\n\n"No, no, that is not it, Tempest Shadow," interjected Daybreaker with a wave of her hoof. She smiled at Fizzlepop's squeak at her old name. "You fought for Harmony, yet not out of Harmony itself. Neither did you do it for my former student." She hummed. Then she cackled. "No... you wished to see your country safe, but you also—" She faced Fizzlepop. "You also wanted to redeem yourself, didn't you?"\n\nFizzlepop bit her tongue.\n\nWith a whip of her mane, Daybreaker tittered to herself. "Oh, but you did, didn't you?" As a couple more giggles escaped her throat, she grinned from ear to ear and leaned forward, "Well, do you think that killing a poor, helpless analyst for my Militarium would ingratiate you?" When Fizzlepop looked at her in surprise, Daybreaker playfully clacked her teeth together and laughed."

  solarreworked.221.d:0 "Fuming and struggling to still get out of Daybreaker's magical bonds, Fizzlepop flared her nostrils and nickered at Daybreaker's continued laughter. Her heart beat rapidly against her chest, and she forced back a couple of stray thoughts from her head. She had agreed to help Twilight, and she did like some of the ponies she befriended since the Storm King's defeat, but...\n\nShe closed her eyes. No, Daybreaker was trying to get into her head, and she wouldn't allow it. But still...\n\nWith a joyful snicker, Daybreaker stalked closer to Fizzlepop. "Admit it, Tempest, you never truly agreed with some of Twilight's more... idealistic claims." She sighed and turned her voice slightly nasally. "'Friendship can solve anything!' 'If we just work together with other creatures, we can improve all our lives!'" With a gag, she stuck out her tongue.\n\nFizzlepop forced herself from nodding. It was only by blind luck that Twilight had figured out what Cozy Glow was going to do. If that didn't prove that anypony, let alone anycreature, would threaten her homeland, then—She cut herself off mentally. Following that mental track was unwise.\n\nSituating herself directly in front of Fizzlepop, Daybreaker sat down and declared, "You wish for ponies to experience Harmony, but there must be restrictions, no?" Fizzlepop didn't reply. "I will take that as a 'yes.'" Daybreaker trailed her eyes toward Fizzlepop's stub of a horn, and she stated nonchalantly, "And, of course, you still miss it, don't you?"\n\nAlthough Fizzlepop didn't answer, her horn sparked instinctively, and Daybreaker's eyes sparkled from the reflected motes of incomplete magic. All Fizzlepop could do was again strain against Daybreaker's magic. If she could more properly form a magical spell, she could attempt to cast something at Daybreaker, but as it stood, the alicorn was too distant to be zapped. Plus, Daybreaker's logic wasn't... wrong.\n\n"You must be curious why you aren't dead." Daybreaker suppressed a snigger. "Simple. I can offer you what Equestria never did and the Storm King would never do." Glancing to Fizzlepop's horn, she declared, "I cannot heal it, but I can teach you how to control it, to an extent." Fizzlepop gawked directly at Daybreaker, and the alicorn grinned. "You can shield Harmony. You can spread Order across the land. You can guide ponies into community, including yourself!"\n\nExtending a hoof, she gazed deeply into Fizzlepop's eyes, and she added, "And I can promise that all who fight against us will fear your name." As she bared her teeth, she inquired, "What do you say, Tempest Shadow?"\n\nHanging her head, Fizzlepop Berrytwist swallowed hard. Ignoring a lump in her throat, Tempest Shadow looked up and nodded. "I accept.""

  solarreworked.222.d:0 "Wincing, Daybreaker summoned another shield spell as Tempest Shadow cracked her hooves in successive order against the energy field. Each impact was like a small lightning storm unleashing itself in a single, deafening explosion. Although she was far from magically drained, she did have to concentrate to avoid the spell shattering like the last one.\n\nWhen her assault failed, Tempest backpedaled and panted. Her horn sputtered and sparked, and each of her hooves glowed and pulsed with blue electricity. Small arcs still occasionally shot between the broken base of Tempest's horn and them, which sent crackling jolts of energy across the floor of the training room.\n\nTempest sized up Daybreaker. Her horn flickered and snapped again. Inhaling a couple more times, she closed her eyes and the violence of her horn subsided, although it still sputtered and sparked slightly. From behind her shield, Daybreaker smiled. She dropped her magic and lightly dabbed at her forehead. Even she had managed to break a sweat.\n\n"They are getting more intense, Tempest," Daybreaker stated matter-of-factly. Sauntering slightly closer, she saw Tempest open her eyes and stare back. "Recall my instruction, though, on how to feel the wild magic coursing through the horn stub." She tapped her own. "It will not be perfect, but you can—" She yelped as Tempest suddenly snarled and unleashed a cohesive, but unstable, bolt of magical energy toward Daybreaker.\n\nDucking at the last second, Daybreaker felt the electricity singe some of the fringes of her fur on her neck, and she immediately fell into a defensive posture. A sneer formed on her muzzle, matching Tempest's own. "Good, you caught me with my defenses down," Daybreaker giggled. She pawed at the ground. "Tell me, though, Tempest, how is YOUR endurance?"\n\nAt that, she released a bolt of fire, which nearly impacted Tempest. At the last second, Tempest sprang to the side, and, under Daybreaker's shield, managed to connect a single, if light, blow to her stomach. Daybreaker woofed, hopped back, and nodded. Tempest was getting the hang of channeling magic. But she was sure of herself.\n\nAs Tempest went for another low attack, Daybreaker jumped, ignoring the pain in her side, and then came down on one of Tempest's forelegs. She instantly surrounded it with magic, before the electrical discharge on Tempest's hoof could be turned to her. Leaning down, Daybreaker smiled and stated, "Your lessons are done for today." She patted Tempest's head. "Until next month.""

  solarreworked.223.d:0 "Rubbing her hooves together, Daybreaker indulged in a small chuckle of glee before she inhaled and closed the last few yards to where two of her elite guards were standing outside the isolation chamber within the Imperial Palace. She had been entirely in their view during her bout of giddiness, but they were wise enough not to react to her break of decorum. She nodded to them both. Wordlessly, they opened the door, and she waltzed in.\n\nPresented with another chamber, she cantered confidently forward. The surrounding walls buzzed with magical wards, reducing any attempt at producing a spell to an impossibility. Even her normally enchanted mane fell flat against her. But none of that mattered. If she couldn't cast magic, nor could her prisoner. Said captive was against a wall, behind a series of bars, and who stared angrily at Daybreaker.\n\n"Hello, Lulu," Daybreaker finally declared, breaking the silence with a snicker. "Oh, how I missed saying that."\n\nLuna kept her mouth shut. She narrowed her eyes.\n\nPouting, Daybreaker tilted her head and inquired, "Have you nothing to say to your sister since we last spoke?" She clicked her tongue. "How could you be so rude? Not even a compliment on how I've polished my armor?"\n\n"Think you that I will grovel, monster?" growled Luna. She bared her teeth and trudged to the bars.\n\n"Come now, Luna," Daybreaker cooed as she leaned forward, effectively pressing her muzzle against Luna's. She shot a smug grin. "I'm not naive. Not like little Cele—"\n\n"Dare not to mention her name, knave!" Luna pounded the ground with a forehoof. Inhaling for a second, a smidgen of her resolve weakened, and she gave Daybreaker a sympathetic frown. "'Tia, I know that you are within this shell, much as I was when my mind was clouded—"\n\n"Oh, please, you think you're going to talk your way into reforming me?" Daybreaker rolled her eyes. "Talk about being a demanding sibling! I'm politely hosting you, and you go asking me to change everything!" Shaking her head, she stepped back from Luna. "How inconsiderate." For a second, she hummed and observed Luna, who simply glared back at her. "And how shall I deal with a rude guest, I wonder?" she asked aloud.\n\nLuna snorted. "I fear not death. Verily, it would be a blessing than to live in your Tartarus which you have created."\n\nWith a snigger, Daybreaker suppressed a couple of cackles and exhaled sadly. "Luna, Luna, Luna. Executing you would be simple. Easy." She puffed out her cheeks. "I have to make the hard choices. But I don't think this one will be hard at all.""

  solarreworked.224.d:0 "Raucous booing filled the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], echoing across the entire city and reaching to the sky, straight to the blazing sun high above. A pair of ponies slowly proceeded through the road, one proud and tall, one low and debased. Multiple magically-powered inhibitor rings were along the latter's horn, and she tiredly trudged ahead of her captor. As she nearly stumbled and collapsed, the former used her magic to prop her back up. With a small laugh, the captor shook her head.\n\n"Is this not the reception you believed you'd have, sister?" Daybreaker inquired, leaning her head down to be closer to Luna's. The latter alicorn's body was dirtied and covered with various bits of vegetables and fruit. She only gave Daybreaker a side-eyed glare.\n\nPursing her lips and clicking her tongue, Daybreaker shook her head. "These were YOUR subjects. Do you not want to greet them?" She spread her forelegs wide, displaying the crowds lining the street. Behind the assembled masses, a not insignificant number of soldiers patrolled along the perimeter. It appeared that practically all of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] had turned up for the display. Whether it was voluntary or not was not something Daybreaker would ever divulge.\n\nAlong the edges of Daybreaker's solo procession, some more guards marched near the crowd, their guns at the ready for any sudden moment from Luna. However, the younger alicorn merely stumbled along, her gaze to the floor. When she saw that her sister was ignoring even the occasional pelt of a vegetable, Daybreaker rolled her eyes.\n\n"Oh, come, Lulu, don't you feel ENRAGED? Don't you want to strike me down?!" She chuckled. "I can see it in your eyes, sister. Poor Luna, to return to the world a new creature, only for her sister to finally realize her potential to protect her ponies." Pausing the procession so she could cup one of Luna's cheeks in a forehoof, Daybreaker inquired, "How does it feel to know you have always been on the wrong side of history?" She bared her teeth. "Perhaps if you had sworn fealty to me from the beginning, I'd look the other way—"\n\nShe stopped as a single glint trickled down Luna's muzzle. However, her sneer faded when Luna's expression hardened and straightened. Without a word, Luna shook her head from Daybreaker's grip and began her humiliating parade. Despite Daybreaker's mocking, she seemed to have straightened her posture and gained more resolve.\n\nWith a snarl, Daybreaker's mane burst into a blaze of blue before she followed her prize. Her silent victory."

On either side of the door, a guard staunchly looked ahead, impassive and still. She glared at them, in turn.\n\nAlthough they remained still and at attention, she caught one start to sweat, and the other coughed like he had suddenly swallowed something. Unsurprisingly, he used it as an excuse to avoid her gaze, and the other met her eyes for a second before he also jerked them away. She curled her lip upward. It wasn't like Daybreaker to make her wait. After all, their monthly training sessions was always delayed because of HER, not Daybreaker. The alicorn was always waiting for Tempest when she arrived, and usually was early by at least ten minutes.\n\nImpatiently tapping a hoof on the ground, she at last demanded of the guards, "Well? Are one of you going to let me in?"\n\n"A-A-A thousand apologies, C-Commander Tempest, but the Empress left orders she wasn't to be—" Before the one guard, the one with the "coughing fit" could finish, there was a piercing scream and a bright flash from under the crack of the door. A moment later, the door flung open with the blood red magic of Daybreaker, and the soldier whimpered, "P-Please enter."\n\nTempest snorted.\n\nMarching into the throne room, she didn't even balk at the heat of the twin moats of lava that bathed everything in a pale orange glow. Daybreaker was climbing back to her throne, and a single one of her elite bodyguards was dragging away a charred corpse. Tempest paid it no heed. When she arrived at the foot of the dais to the throne, she bowed and asked, "You called for me, Empress Daybreaker?"\n\nDaybreaker smirked and brushed a bit of ash from her fur. "Yes, I did. I have a surprise for you Tempest." Her eyes burned brightly. Leaning down, she added, "It is entirely to your discretion what you do with this information."\n\n"Is somepony threatening Harmony?" Tempest arched an eyebrow.\n\nA snort escaped Daybreaker's nose. Scrunching her muzzle, she cackled and fell back into her throne. "No!" she exclaimed after wiping a tear from her eye. "Nopony I can't handle." She grinned. Like twin pits of hellfire, her eyes gazed right through Tempest, and she asked, "How'd you like to pay a visit to some old friends?""

When the lock clicked, he sighed and lightly dropped the keys back into their pouch. He turned around. Nighttime had already fallen in Shire, and the streets were beginning to grow quiet. At least, for civilians, anyway.\n\nHe caught the steady beat of hooves on pavement as a patrol went by on one of the main streets of the city. As they passed by the side street to his humble floral shop, he gave a nervous wave as a couple glanced his way. The soldiers didn't respond, but they at least left him alone. He shuddered as the shouting and barking of orders to get on the ground still filled his head. Despite it being months ago that the small mix-up had happened, where he didn't have his night curfew papers on him, it still haunted him.\n\nPatting down where he stored it, just in case he got stopped, he strutted out but a couple of feet when he heard somepony clear their throat to his right. He whirled toward the noise. There was a faint shape in the shadows, but the streetlights and moon weren't at the right angle to penetrate the darkness.\n\nAt the sight of the visitor, he gingerly stepped back and stuttered, "Who's there? I-I have my papers, okay? I just finished up work. Had to look after my plants." He gulped when the pony didn't respond. "D-Do you need help?"\n\nA chuckle. Seconds later, a feminine voice declared, "Oh, you can help me, I suppose." A single, armored hoof stepped out of the shadow. Spring Rain's eyes widened when he saw a hint of a dark orchid fur coat. Stammering and sputtering, he stumbled back as there was a crackle of electricity from a broken horn, which flashed briefly to reveal opal-colored eyes.\n\n"F-Fizzy!" he squeaked when Fizzlepop Berrytwist exited the shadows like a tempest, her horn raring with energy.\n\nFizzlepop slammed a hoof on the ground. "My name is TEMPEST!" she barked while baring her teeth. Taking him in, her expression softened, just barely, and she quipped, "How've you been, Spring?" He simply whimpered. Tilting her head, she tittered, "That well, huh? Sounds like you could use a pick-me-up." Eyes brightening, she exclaimed, "I think a know somepony who could help!"\n\nBefore Spring could stutter a question, Tempest lunged at him and cracked a hoof into his head.

He let out a small meow and brushed against one of her dangling hindlegs. With a giggle, she reached down and gently stroked his head, which earned a couple of playful licks on her petting hoof. Shooing it away, she went back to drinking her tea and checked out the window.\n\nAt the moment, the sky was clear, and she could make out Luna's night without much difficulty, although that always had the possibility of changing at any time. Along the border of [EQS.GetNameDef] and [CRY.GetNameDef], the weather was both uncontrolled by pegasi and highly variable. She placed down her tea and went back to her book.\n\nFor all of about a minute, anyway, until there was a hiss at the window. Glitter rolled her eyes and called, "Goldy, it's probably just a squirrel! Be nice!" Before she could get another paragraph in, there was a sudden crash as the window shattered and a body hit the ground. Goldy screeched and scampered off, claws scratching the floor.\n\nGlitter screamed. Jumping up from her seat and her eyes wide as saucers, Glitter's heart thrashed against her chest as she recognized the pony. She hadn't seen him in years, but she'd remember Spring Rain anywhere. He moaned and struggled to rise, but one of his legs gave out. "Spring!" she cried and galloped over, but not before another shape hopped inside.\n\nGlitter's blood froze. "F-Fizzy?!" she yelped as she took in the armor that her old friend was wearing. "W-What're you—" Before she could finish, her chest exploded in a firework of agony, and she collapsed, wheezing and writhing on the floor. As she choked, Fizzlepop stomped up to her and bent down.\n\n"My name," she growled, "is Tempest Shadow!"\n\nGagging and coughing, Glitter whimpered, "F-Fizzy, I-I don't under—"\n\n\"QUIET!" Tempest bellowed, making Glitter flatten her ears against her head. Tempest's horn crackled. Blindingly harsh electric blue light filled the room and Glitter whined. A few tears trickled down her cheeks. Tempest snarled. "I lost my horn, I lost my future, I lost EVERYTHING because of you two!" She shoved Glitter against Spring.

Breath coming in frantic, panicked gasps, she watched as Tempest's horn snapped, popped, crackled, and hissed as small bolts of electricity and magic shot in every direction from the stub. Faint wisps of blue connected between the horn and Tempest's front hooves. With every step she took around the room, like she was stalking her former friends, sparks burst up from the impact.\n\nIf her blood pressure remained as high as it had gotten much longer, Glitter knew she'd develop hypertension and a myriad of other health issues. Probably lower priority than not dying, though. She met Tempest's glare, her own eyes bleary and teary, and she saw her leer over Spring Rain for a second. "Open your eyes, Spring, Glitter, know how you turned me into this!" she snarled. Slamming each hoofbeat into Glitter's cottage's floor, she paced around them again. "Unless, of course, you think that I'm TERRIFYING or a MONSTER."\n\nWhimpering, Glitter quivered her lip and she wailed as Tempest got closer, "Fizzy! I-I'm sorry!"\n\n"I don't need your apologies!" Tempest snapped. A whirlwind practically built around her horn as she dangerously slunk toward Glitter. "I was rejected! I was outcast! But I pulled myself together! I became the monster everypony feared! I was commanded the Storm King's armies! I decimated Zebrica! You think that 'sorry' is going to change anything?!" Baring her teeth, she glowered at Glitter, who could barely keep her eyes open from the tears streaming down them.\n\nBetween hiccups and sobs, Glitter bleated, "I-It was my fault! I-I tossed the ball in that cave! I-I should have gone, not you! I'm sorry!" Barely seeing Spring's bruised body beside her, she wailed, "WE'RE sorry!" At that, the hurricane of anger around Tempest seemed to dissipate, at least somewhat. Her horn stopped and she stood still.\n\nEverything was silent.\n\nAfter a few more blubbers, Glitter looked up, and she saw Tempest staring at her, confusion plastered on her face. Finally, Tempest asked, "You wanted to go in?" Glitter nodded frantically.\n\n"B-But you just went in when Spring and I hesitated!" She sat up. Checking Spring, and seeing he was only cut in a couple of places from being thrown in, she mumbled, "You were always brave and headstrong, a-and I just—" She bit back a couple more tears. "I'm sorry."\n\nTempest pressed her tongue against the side of her mouth. With a tired exhale, she sighed and muttered, "I see." Another pregnant pause passed, and she grunted. She spun on her hooves. "I still have a job to do. Harmony's not going to protect itself." She paused at the broken window and looked back."

In random directions, magical energy whipped out and zapped various parts of Glitter's cottage, leaving behind the scorched stench of ozone. With the acrid smell in the air, Glitter could only cough and gag as she choked for something fresh to revitalize her.\n\nTempest began to stalk around the room, as if she was circling prey like a timberwolf or Ursa Major. Glitter's head swam. If her blood pressure stayed this high for much longer, she'd probably develop a myriad of health issues, although that was of lesser importance than not dying. When Tempest glared directly at her, Glitter whimpered and blinked her bleary, tear-stained eyes. With a weak whine, Glitter began, "Fizzy! I-I'm so—"\n\n"No! No apologies! Open your eyes! See for yourself what you two did to me!" At that, Tempest's horn flared again, bathing the cottage in electric blue. Glitter could barely see Spring shift. He looked like he'd survive, but Tempest must have done a number on him. Still, she drew herself up and felt her heart skip a beat. She had to try.\n\n"I said I'm—"\n\nShe yelped when electricity shot over her head. Cowering away from Tempest, she stammered rapidly, "I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" Tempest stomped toward her. With every hoofbeat, sparks of energy flew up from the ground. The hum of electricity filled Glitter's hearing. When Tempest was but a few inches away, she squirmed and squeaked, sweat breaking out on her face. With a weak wail, she began, "I-I'm the one at fault! I-I threw that ball in the cave, a-and I should have—"\n\n"ENOUGH!" Another bolt of lightning zoomed next to Glitter. Yelping and diving to the floor, she shook and quivered. Tempest's voice was practically in her ear. "I lost it all because of you two! I became the monster everypony feared! I led the Storm King's armies across Zebrica and decimated an entire continent! This ends tonight!" At that, she whinnied and Glitter steeled herself.\n\nSuddenly, though, the room went quiet. Still, Glitter counted to ten, waiting for something to hit her, but there was nothing. Batting away tears, she looked up to see Tempest leaving through the window. Tempest glanced back. Narrowing her eyes, she snarled, "I'll never forgive you." The words twisted in Glitter's stomach like a knife blade.\n\nAs Tempest disappeared into the night, she snapped, "Remember what you've made me do!""

In a few years, she could have probably overpowered the Storm King himself. Yet now she simply sat in a cafe, in Whinnyapolis, constantly fondling a cup of coffee in her hooves.\n\nThey were late. That was the only thought that coursed through her mind.\n\nIt wasn't like she had all day to wait. Technically she was supposed to be on another mission for Daybreaker, but knowing that both of her... former friends turned quasi-friends again were nearby, she had to capitalize on the chance to meet once more. Still, didn't make it easy.\n\n"Fiz—Tempest!" she heard Glitter Drops exclaim. Turning around, Tempest spotted Glitter and Spring Rain trotting up from across the street. Spring still had a few visible bruises, but appeared to be on the mend. For a split second, Tempest's throat tightened at the injuries, but she dismissed them. Instead, she nodded at them and Glitter hurriedly walked up to her.\n\nBriefly hesitating, Glitter finally darted in a quick hug, which made Tempest nicker and grunt, "Let go. Now!" Glitter jumped back. Her eyes were wide and her mouth drawn back in a worried grimace. Tempest sighed. "Just, no hugging, okay?"\n\nAfter slipping in and ordering drinks, Glitter stated, "Me and Spring didn't think that you'd want to talk with us so soon." She bit her lip. "Y-You seemed rather upset. N-Not that I don't understand why, and uh—" Reaching behind her head, she uncomfortably scratched at her neck and mumbled, "I had everything planned out to say with Spring, but, I guess it sounded better in my head."\n\nWith her nerves still frazzled, Tempest merely glanced aside and muttered, "It's fine. I just—I just thought we should catch up more."\n\n"Don't you have an Empress to report to?" Spring interjected with a bit of venom. "Are you just scouting us out to find something that would make her unpony us?" That got a glare from Glitter, especially as a couple of soldiers marched by in the street. At the very least, Spring was prudent enough to shut his mouth while they were nearby.\n\nTempest bared her teeth. "And, what? You'd suggest that we try and talk things out with changelings. Maybe sit down for tea and crumpets with another Storm King?!" With a scoffing tsk, she declared, "Please." Spring hung his head, and she flinched.

Tilting her head, she stated, "But, I trust that you have something more in mind than hurling insults at me?" At that, Dash growled. Daybreaker only grinned wider, baring fangs prominently.\n\n"When I get outta here, I'm going to shove my hoof so far up—"\n\n"'When?'" Daybreaker echoed.

Stepping an inch closer, which in the dungeon cell, made it feel even more claustrophobic, she leaned forward and stated, "You are not escaping unless I WILL it." She pouted.

"Of course, you would say you're right, but ponies would hate you. They'd know you broke their trust. You're supposed to be dependable, after all. How could you not be depended upon to protect Harmony, rather than destroy it?"\n\n"I—I—You're trying to trick me!" Dash snapped, although her voice quivered noticeably.\n\n"Am I?"

"I can handle a little... critique." Before Applejack could actually begin, Daybreaker held up a hoof and declared, "Of course, be prepared for consequences for your lies."\n\nApplejack blinked. "What?" she flatly inquired.\n\nDrawing on the stones with a hoof, Daybreaker hummed and hawed for a moment. At last, she gazed directly at Applejack. Her mane flapped evenly in its unnatural wind, although it grew slightly brighter as her heart skipped a couple of beats excitedly. She shrugged. "I merely am informing you that it such a shame to see an esteemed, HONEST member of society stoop so low as to slander and lie."\n\n"I ain't doing nothing of the sort!" Flaring her nostrils, Applejack blew back a bit of her mane which had fallen in front of her face. "If I could, I'd tell everypony how ya are nothing but a two-timing, rattlesnake of a—"\n\n"Oh, please!" Daybreaker waved a hoof dismissively and huffed. "I am nothing but honest about my intentions!" She giggled. "I further Harmony, my ponies follow. It is a simple agreement, and it protects them." Leaning in, she smarmily smiled, "But imagine what would happen if you spoke your 'truth' to them? Would it help? Or would it harm?"\n\n"I—" Applejack cut herself off. "I'd still be speaking the truth!"\n\n"And what is truth, Applejack? Would you take that chance of harming them all?"\n\n"Well, I..." At that, Applejack trailed off, and Daybreaker grinned.\n\nWithout a word, she got up, and briefly paused before stating, "Reflect on what your truth would do. I believe an honest pony like yourself will be able to see what damage it'd do.""

  solarreworked.247.d:0 "With a huff, Daybreaker stood over the pony who had shrunk into a corner as best she could of her cell. Although Fluttershy had stood up better than Daybreaker had initially expected, she was still quivering and doing her best to avoid Daybreaker's gaze, and had wrapped her wings around herself as a way of trying to form a better protective barrier.\n\nDaybreaker merely clicked her tongue. Frankly, it was almost pitiful how different Fluttershy had reacted compared to the other two before her. Almost sad. Almost.\n\n"W-Whatever it is you want," Fluttershy at last stuttered, "I won't do it." She puffed out her chest, which made the single chain holding her down clink and clatter as its links dropped from her wings. As best she could, Fluttershy got to her hooves, and although she stayed in the corner, there was a small flicker of determination in her eyes.\n\n"And why is that, dearest Fluttershy?" Daybreaker inquired, mimicking the tone that she had previously heard Discord use in reference to Fluttershy. She batted her eyelashes. "What could you possibly believe I wish for you to do?"\n\n"I-I, well, um, I don't know," admitted Fluttershy, who paused and then scratched her chin in thought. By now, the glow from the city's nighttime lights had started to dim, leaving only Daybreaker's mane as the primary source of light in the dungeon cell. In the orange, almost red glow, Fluttershy appeared to be covered in lava.\n\n"Then how could you say that you won't do what I want?" Daybreaker stepped forward, and Fluttershy flinched back, but the pegasus stood straight. However, the small bit of strength that she had called upon had died, and she remained nearly ready to collapse again into a heap.\n\n"I—I—I—" Fluttershy squeezed her eyes shut. "Oh, I don't know! I just know that you'll want to do something horrible and—"\n\nWith a shushing noise, Daybreaker placed a hoof on Fluttershy's muzzle and shook her head. Fluttershy squeaked, but didn't move. "I only do what's best for my ponies. Even those who betray my trust." Daybreaker nearly spat out the last few words. With a whimper, Fluttershy winced back further. "But I guide them all. They do not know their way, some days." She smirked. "Much like your animals, no?"\n\nWhen Daybreaker pulled back her hoof, Fluttershy licked her lips and then muttered, "Well, a bit, I suppose."\n\n"You're their better, as I am all of ponykind's. Is it not natural for those who know more to guide them?" Daybreaker arched a brow. In response, Fluttershy hummed, and then she sat down in thought.\n\nDaybreaker smirked."

  solarreworked.248.t:0 "Self-Sacrifice"
  solarreworked.248.d:0 ""I have not a WORD to say to you, you beast!" Rarity exclaimed as Daybreaker entered the cell in which she resided. Despite the fact that her mane was ruffled and she had a few splotches of dirt on her fur, she managed to somehow look the more dignified of the Element Bearers that had been captured. When Daybreaker arched a brow, Rarity simply huffed and looked away.\n\n"You say I am the monster, yet I am not the one in a cage," Daybreaker stated evenly. Sauntering up to the window of the cell, she stared out over her city. Shingles glistened in the sunlight and the form of ponies below, like ants, wormed their way through [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Sneering, Daybreaker glanced back and inquired, "Have you nothing to say?"\n\n"Never!" barked Rarity.\n\n"Such greed. So self-centered. Where is that generosity that Rarity is so known for?" Daybreaker chuckled.\n\n"'For which Rarity is known,' dar—" Rarity cut herself off with a grunt. Puffing out her cheeks, she grumbled, "Twilight has affected me too much." At that, Daybreaker merely grinned.\n\nMarching closer, Daybreaker stood over Rarity, who remained upright in defiance, and then leaned down. Roughly dragging Rarity's chin up so they could stare at each other, Daybreaker bore her fangs and hissed, "Are you not curious? 'What could Daybreaker possibly mean?'" Her eyes glittered threateningly.\n\n"Well, ye—I mean never!" Rarity jerked her head off Daybreaker's hoof. "I am the paragon of generosity. You are twisting words!" She snorted.\n\n"Ah, but you ARE curious. I would be, too. I can only imagine what is going through your head. What could I have meant by my statement, hmm?" With a low chortle, Daybreaker grabbed Rarity's cheek again and she declared, "How is your generosity helping anypony?!" She indicated the window. "You selfishly hoard your gifts, your abilities to, what, make dresses?"\n\n"They're my masterpieces! Don't you dare—"\n\n"Oh, but I shall. You believe you're being generous by clothing a few ponies and calling it friendship. What good is that, when others die to protect Harmony? How are you being generous to them?" Daybreaker's mane whipped into a fury, glowing a bright blue as she cupped Rarity's chin. "You selfishly lived in your wealth. You barely helped when Harmony was in danger! Do you not see?!"\n\n"I-I aided thousands of—"\n\n"Yet you ignored so many more! When the call went for full service to Equestria, did you answer? No! You were selfish and wished to control your own life!" At that, Rarity winced, and Daybreaker held back a smirk. With a final snarl, she quipped, "And you harm others by not sacrificing everything to further Harmony. How could you?!"\n\nShe spat on the ground as she pulled back. As she left the room, she grinned when she caught a few sniffles from the cell cot."
  solarreworked.248.a:0 "Let her emotions stew."
  solarreworked.249.t:0 "Joy, Joy, Joy"
  solarreworked.249.d:0 "Daybreaker gritted her teeth rubbed her forehead. Before her, the apathetic form of Pinkie Pie lay, the pony's eyes slightly glazed over in boredom. Unsurprisingly, as she had learned from Twilight before, Pinkie's mane perfectly flat, and her vibrant color seemed to have faded a smidgen.\n\nIf she was more impatient, she'd have simply fried Pinkie then and there, but it was not the wisest solution. Getting through to Pinkie, though, was an exercise in endurance that challenged even her extreme patience.\n\n"I don't know," Pinkie finally mumbled. Tracing a couple of shapes into her cot's blanket, she sighed and rolled onto her back. As she stared at the ceiling, she grumbled, "Should you stay or should you go? If you go it could be trouble, but if you stay, maybe it'll be double." She shrugged. "Whatever."\n\nDaybreaker blinked. Shaking her head, she huffed, "Do you not want to know—"\n\n"Joy? What is even that anymore?" Pinkie moaned and closed her eyes.\n\nUneasily licking her lips, Daybreaker sat down on the floor and concentrated on her magic. As her horn ignited, she gently nudged the sun back a little higher into the sky. After a few seconds, the angle was just perfect to land on Pinkie and obscure Daybreaker in its light. It was bright enough it made Pinkie roll over just in the direction that she wanted.\n\nLeaning forward, a warm smile on Daybreaker's face, she stated, "I only offer you a chance to feel whole again."\n\n"I don't even know what that is anymore. It's not like it matters." Exhaling, Pinkie shifted to stare at Daybreaker. Daybreaker grinned wider.\n\n"Oh, but there is so much joy and laughter obeying me." Sweeping a hoof to the window, she exclaimed, "Ponies from across the Empire serve with a smile as they further Harmony's—my—goals." She glanced back at Pinkie, she added, "Merely ask any pony on the street. They will confess to the pure elation they have following me."\n\n"I don't know, sounds rather bossy to me," Pinkie mumbled. Tossing around again, she grunted, "But, eh, you can go ahead, or whatever. Everything is just go in one ear and out the other." To emphasize, she stuck a hoof in one ear, and it somehow emerged out the second.\n\nChalking it up to Pinkie's strange abilities, Daybreaker stated, "Stresses abound. Emotions can fray into depression seeing how Harmony is broken everywhere. But you can rest knowing that I shoulder the burden for my ponies." She placed a hoof on Pinkie's chest. With a warm a smile she could muster, she declared, "All you must do is obey me."\n\nPinkie sighed. "Maybe.""

  solarreworked.250.t:0 "Chosen Successors"
  solarreworked.250.d:0 ""Please, Empress, allow me!" Rarity exclaimed as she darted ahead of Daybreaker. With gusto, she sliced away some overgrown vines before the cave entrance to the Tree of Harmony. Daybreaker merely smiled and nodded before stepping forward. Rarity giggled as she passed.\n\n"Okay now, little ones, go check the cave to make sure it's safe, first," Fluttershy hissed to some nearby animals that she had coerced along. "Because if you don't..." She didn't finish, but her scowl spoke for her thoughts well enough. In return, the animals bolted and dashed ahead of Daybreaker. They squeaked an all clear.\n\nBeside Daybreaker, Rainbow Dash walked mutely, her face a mix of anger and frustration. On the other side, Sunrise Sparkle also strode. Sunrise glanced up at Daybreaker. "Empress," she began. At that, Daybreaker arched a brow. "How did..." Twilight bit her lip. "How could you achieve what I couldn't?"\n\nDaybreaker chuckled as she glanced back at Applejack and Pinkie, the former speaking to Pinkie about something she discovered about orderly conduct. Pinkie was just nodding along. Peering back at Sunrise, Daybreaker merely stated, "I just showed them the error of their thinking, as I did you." She grinned. "They were applying their Elements incorrectly."\n\nAt that, Sunrise nodded and they soon threaded their way through the cave. Behind a bend, Daybreaker caught the blue glow of the tree, and her wings rustled excitedly. As they rounded it, she breathed in excitedly as she took in the crystal tree. Its branches looked sickly, and the fringes of its limbs had grown dim and lifeless. But in each a brilliant glimmer of one of the Elements shone intensely through into the room.\n\n"Pinkamena," Daybreaker stated, and Pinkie immediately zipped up to her. "Retrieve them," she ordered. Pinkie saluted and darted to the tree. At Sunrise's confused glance, she merely shook her head to make her remain silent.\n\nAs Pinkie reached the base of the tree, she paused for a moment and scratched her head. Looking back at the group, she asked, "Don't they normally, you know, float out of here?"\n\n"I knew I should have been the one to take them," Sunrise whispered in Daybreaker's ear. As she pulled back, she called to Pinkie, "Try your Element. It should open for you!" At that, Pinkie nodded and hopped toward the limb with Laughter in it. As she reached it, she touched her hoof to the tree, and for a second, there was a crackle of energy.\n\nSuddenly, an explosion rocked the cavern, and Pinkie flew backward. She bounced back up, smoking but unharmed, and Daybreaker ground her teeth together. She looked at the scorched remains of the tree's limb, and the shattered crystal. It rejected them. It rejected its bearers! It knew!\n\nSlamming a hoof on the ground, Daybreaker screamed, and the Bearers dove to the ground in fear."

  solarreworked.230.d:0 ""Come walk with me, Sunrise Sparkle." At those words, Sunrise jerked her head up from the tome she had buried her nose in. On one of her laboratory's tables, she held a couple of Breezies in containers and various notes and entries about her studies of the miniature pony creatures scattered throughout the room. For a couple of seconds, she stared blankly at Daybreaker, and then hastily hopped off from her seat and darted toward the alicorn.\n\nWithout a word, Daybreaker turned on her heels and marched solemnly toward the gardens of the Imperial Palace. Along the way, servants bowed out of their way, some nervously eyeing their empress, but more watching Sunrise with concern. Sunrise merely shot them some warning looks. Perhaps they were loyal. Perhaps they believed in Harmony like she did. But maybe they didn't. Anypony who threatened the embodiment of Equestria's heart would face her fury.\n\nSoon, they emerged into the gardens, the smell of leaves and flowers assaulting Sunrise's nose with their aromatic perfumes. The entire time, Daybreaker had been silent. Given the nature of her mane's rapid thrashing, she was thinking. Taking a deep breath, Sunrise inquired, "Is there something bothering you, P—Empress?"\n\nDaybreaker sighed. Caressing a flower on a nearby bush, which began to wilt in the heat radiating off of Daybreaker, she stated without looking at Sunrise, "[CRY.GetNameDef]. Your sister-in-law." She faced Sunrise. "Your niece. All of them are weighing on my mind." Furrowing her brow, she added, "You know that I do not wish to see my ponies come to harm, Sunrise."\n\nSunrise merely nodded.\n\n"[CRY.GetLeader] has become a beacon to all those who do not wish to embrace the future!" As her mane glowed a bright blue, she looked into a reflection in the fountain beside which they had stopped. "That's why I have a new mission for you, my lady inquisitor."\n\nImmediately straightening, Sunrise stood at attention. As Daybreaker scrutinized her, she declared, "[CRY.GetNameDef] is a rogue, offending nation, but I trust [CRY.GetLeader] to not be unreasonable." For a second, a smirk crossed her mane, and Sunrise's heart skipped a beat. "Go. In my glory. Make her fear. Make her understand the gravity of her error. If she does not comprehend..." Without finishing her statement, Daybreaker conveyed all she needed.\n\nSunrise swallowed. "What if there's another way, Empress?"\n\n"Such as?"\n\n"I simply believe that she is not ready to accept your true radiance! Perhaps if I... infiltrated them instead, I could find another way."\n\n"Guile?" Daybreaker grinned. Holding back a titter, she proclaimed, "My student, I find it amusing. If you wish, you have my blessing." Her smile disappeared. "But do not fail me. The Sun's wrath spares nopony.""

  solarreworked.231.d_a:0 ""A-Announcing t-the diplomat f-from [EQS.GetNameDef]: I—" Before the herald of the Crystal Court could conclude, the doors to the throne room burst inward, a dozen ponies, dressed in robes of fine fabric lined with gold and dyed a dark red, marched into the presence of Princess Cadance. Immediately the guards assembled in the room tightened their grips on their rifles, although they remained at parade rest. Cadance, alone and without Shining Armor or Flurry Heart, sat on her throne. From her frown, the break in procedure was clearly unwelcome.\n\nAt the head of the procession, a dark red unicorn stepped forward, her purple eyes blazing with righteous fury as she bowed for a total of three seconds. With an air of superiority, she proudly proclaimed to all assembled within the court, "I bear a message from the God-Empress of Ponykind, Daybreaker, the Dawn Star, Sol Invicta, Bearer of the Holy Flame, She Who Raises the Sun, Savior of the World." When her words had echoed and died in the hall, she bared her teeth.\n\nFor a moment, she remained silent, letting the titles sink in, the atmosphere continue to build. Slowly, some of the other ponies in the procession spread out, and the unicorn came closer to the dais of Cadance, before she stopped when the nearest guards lowered their weapons to aim at her.\n\n"Princess, it would be most unwise for your troops to fire." The unicorn grinned. "While I, Nova Glow, inquisitor of her holy Solaris Inqusitionis may be expendable, Empress Daybreaker would be most displeased."\n\n"You're bold, Nova," Cadance replied with a snort. She nodded to her guards, who moved slightly closer. Nova eyed them, but didn't move. In fact, she leaned forward slightly, although remained fastened to where she stood.\n\n"Then I shall be brief, as the Empress demanded of me." Somehow, Nova's sneer grew more sinister, and a fire practically burned in her eyes. "The Empress requires that you kneel. You shall return you and your ponies to the Imperium and experience her blessing. If you do not..." As she trailed off, a small giggle escaped her lips. She sighed."
  solarreworked.231.d_b:0 ""Announcing the diplomat from [EQS.GetNameDef]: The Imperial Magistrate, Raven Inkwell!" When he was finished, the herald of the Crystal Court quickly ducked aside as a small procession of ponies entered the throne room, no more than about a dozen in number. Most were soldiers, dressed in bright white uniforms and carrying magical weaponry. Although they hid their emotions well, they still shot the assembled guards of the court wary glances.\n\nAt their head, Raven Inkwell, wearing a smarter suit than usual, bowed curtly to Cadance, and nodded to her guards. As they fanned out, she proclaimed, "I come in the name of Empress Daybreaker, the Dawn Star, Sol Invicta, and Protector of Equus!" She waited a moment for the title to sink in and adjusted her glasses. "I wish to extend regrets that she could not meet with you—"\n\n"You can drop the act, Raven," Cadance interjected with a wave of her hoof. Scowling faintly, she leaned forward in her throne and steepled her hooves together. Eyeing Raven for a second or two, she huffed, "At least she sent somepony who isn't a rabid zealot. I don't need to be treated like one of her frightened subjects."\n\nSighing, Raven shook her head and grunted, "Fine, I'll admit it would get tiresome after some time, anyway." She trotted closer, two of her guards following her. As she did, the [CRY.GetAdjective] guards nearest to Cadance lowered their rifles, although the remainder stood at parade rest.\n\nRaven glanced at them, then stated, "I'll be brief, as I can already guess what your answer will be." A spark of sadness glinted behind her eyes, but she continued on. "Daybreaker demands that you return to the Harmony Pact. As the Empress of Ponykind, she wishes to see everypony under her."\n\nRaven pressed her tongue against a cheek. Cadance, likewise, appeared a bit flustered. As Cadance leaned back and nibbled on her bottom lip, Raven added as she started to step away, "She has promised retribution." She swallowed. "Please consider what happens if you don't agree.""

  solarreworked.232.d:0 "Today, a diplomat from [EQS.GetNameDef] arrived in a grand entrance in the Crystal Court, after we agreed to a meeting by a representative of [EQS.GetLeader]. There was little chance that we would ever comply to a request from her, but by appearing open, we can at least gauge how likely it is that she's bluffing on her strength. We are not alone on both Equus and elsewhere in the world, but we certainly are one of the nearest nations that could earn her ire.\n\nAfter a tense introduction, the diplomat declared that we have one opportunity to return to being under the boot of [EQS.GetLeader]. If we refuse, grave consequences were promised. There is no guarantee that she will actually follow through, but it is always a possibility.\n\nIf we agree, we may at least keep some semblance of Harmony under [CRY.GetLeader], but if we refuse, we could lose everything. We are between a rock and a hard place, and it appears there's no way to wriggle out of it."

  solarreworked.233.d_a:0 "Daybreaker smirked as she watched the servant that had had the fortune to be the one to greet her lead her toward the throne room of the Crystal Palace. With each step that she took, Daybreaker's heavy, metaled hooves made the hired pony flinch and jolt. He wasn't the only one, however, as every other staff member of the Crystal Palace, when they saw her, stepped aside. A couple even bowed. 'As they should,' she mused to herself.\n\nAfter passing through a resplendent hallway, the clear crystal of the outward wall allowing unhindered sunlight to sparkle through the passage, they arrived at the doors to the throne room. While Daybreaker could have effortlessly teleported her way there from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the slow anticipation, for both her and Cadance, who had no doubt been informed by now of her arrival, was too tantalizing to pass up.\n\n"Open it. Now," Daybreaker commanded, her tone icy.\n\nHastily bowing, the servant pressed the entrance open, and all eyes that were in the throne room turned to her. In short order, the guards that were inside had their guns trained on Daybreaker, and Daybreaker scoffed. Ignoring them, she marched straight toward Cadance and barked, "Court has ended. Everypony is dismissed." When nopony complied, her mane flared and she bellowed, "LEAVE US!"\n\nThe guards glanced to Cadance. Reluctantly, she nodded her head, and they complied.\n\nWhen they were alone, Cadance demanded, "Why did you come here? You didn't inform the staff that—"\n\n"Does an aunt need a reason to visit her niece?" Daybreaker inquired, which made Cadance flinch. Daybreaker let the silence grow. After sneering, she smacked her lips and stated, "But, yes, I DO have reason to visit, my dear Cadance."\n\n"Don't," interjected Cadance. "Say what you want, and leave us be. Ponies will be panicking once words reaches that—"\n\n"What they do is none of my concern, niece," shot back Daybreaker. With a frown, she faced Cadance. "What DOES concern me, however, is your daughter." At that, Cadance's face paled. Grinning, Daybreaker tittered, "I believe she's better served learning in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. I'm sure you see no issue with this?"\n\nAs Cadance opened her mouth, most likely to protest, Daybreaker stalked toward her. Tilting her head slightly, Daybreaker stated, "I would choose wisely. After all, it'd be a shame if Flurry would have to learn, firsthoof, what experiencing grief is, or post traumatic stress. Or, perhaps, would you prefer her to see her family torn apart through a bitter, hot feud?""
  solarreworked.233.d_b:0 "As a blast of cool wind from frozen fields outside the Crystal City washed across the platform of the train station, Daybreaker was almost startled when she heard Sunrise Sparkle call to her. Turning to the side, she grinned when her student galloped from the safety of the main station and toward Daybreaker. The Imperial train car had only just arrived, and her guards were still in the process of organizing for her protection. A couple wary ones started to draw their rifles on Sunrise, but Daybreaker halted them with a glare.\n\nWhen Sunrise reached Daybreaker, she skidded to a halt, opened her mouth, then paused. A faint blush reaching her cheeks, she curtsied, then fully bowed and remained prostrate. Daybreaker gently pressed a hoof against the back of Sunrise's neck. "Rise," she commanded, and Sunrise quickly bounced back.\n\n"You are most eager, Sunrise," Daybreaker stated, drawing a small snort from the obvious observation. Without words, she motioned for Sunrise to fall beside her, and Sunrise happily obeyed. She practically pranced to Daybreaker's left, her tail bobbing lightly with each springy step.\n\n"It's just that it's been weeks since we've last spoken face to face, Empress!" Sunrise exclaimed. "Did you know that crystal ponies have a higher tolerance for serration and other forms of trauma, but can almost shatter with a strong enough blunt impact?" With a giddy squeal, she hopped ahead of Daybreaker and started to trot backwards. "It's led to some extremely effective threats for unearthing rebel cells." In a burst of magic, she materialized a stack of papers and started to sort through them. "I can show you—"\n\n"Sunrise, while I am pleased you have adapted to this land, we can discuss your discoveries later." At that, Sunrise's expression fell slightly, but she nodded and banished the papers back to whence they came. As they reached the Crystal Palace, Daybreaker stated as a couple flakes of snow melted as they neared her mane, "I am here for Flurry."\n\n"What do you want with her?" Sunrise inquired, arching a brow curiously. "Is there something wrong?"\n\n"Her education," replied Daybreaker confidently. At that, Sunrise nodded her head and hummed in affirmation. "She has spent too long under whelps' influence. She must be enlightened as she matures."\n\n"That's great!" Sunrise's horn sparked with energy. After a second, another stack of papers, as well as a number of textbooks, popped into the air next to her. As she started to flip through them, Sunrise rambled, "I have her new thaumaturgy lessons, practical magic applications, theoretical textbook of magic, and—"\n\n"Sunrise," Daybreaker quipped, making her inquisitor pause and look up. "I shall handle it personally. You agree that I would be best for her, no?""

  solarreworked.234.t:0 "The Last Demand"
  solarreworked.234.d_a:0 "Today Daybreaker arrived in the Crystal City to speak with [ROOT.GetLeader], unannounced, with an unexpected request. According to her, [ROOT.GetLeader] is too compromised to provide proper safety and education for Flurry Heart, and has made it clear that the young alicorn should be brought from the Crystal Empire to [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for safekeeping. No doubt, as well, for leverage in case [ROOT.GetLeader] decided to try and throw off her yoke.\n\nDaybreaker has made it exceedingly obvious that rejecting her demand would be disastrous for our nation. Not hers, only ours. She is not one for subtly when she wants something, and if we were to refuse, we would very likely be signing the death warrants of millions of lives. However, Flurry is still innocent and untainted by the chaos of the world, and to give her up would be breaking every promise a parent makes to their children. The choice to make will be hard, regardless of the final decision."
  solarreworked.234.d_b:0 "It was a surprise to be sure when Daybreaker arrived in the Crystal City to speak with [ROOT.GetLeader], however the word arrived shortly before she did, and [ROOT.GetLeader] was able to intersect the Empress's route and spend additional time with her. As much as she was interested in learning more about what [ROOT.GetLeader] had been studying since arriving within the Crystal Empire, there was another matter that weighed on her. Flurry Heart. As the young alicorn is still in the care of Princess Cadance, she has yet to receive proper instruction in the ways of Order and Harmony.\n\nAlthough [ROOT.GetLeader] believes that she can more than adequately train Flurry in the Empress's stead, Daybreaker has clearly taken a keen interest in Flurry's education. It will be disappointing to let her go, but she will one day return, entirely understanding of the Empress's grand vision of Order and Harmony. It is not like [ROOT.GetLeader] will have to worry about growing old and never seeing her niece again."

  solarreworked.235.d:0 ""What's that? Oh, is that a—OH! What's that?!"\n\nDaybreaker furrowed her brow as she attempted to suppress some growls that escaped her throat. Ahead of her, her young niece, Flurry Heart, now under her care, bounced from one area of the hallway to another. For a brief second, Flurry stopped in front of a tapestry that had recently been woven and hung from the ceiling. It depicted Daybreaker riding over a wave of fire, to extinguish the shadows of darkness from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nWhen she approached, Daybreaker put on a smile and she declared, "It's merely art, my niece." Flurry glanced her way. The curls and short bangs on Flurry's head bobbed and jittered with the motion. Deep within, Daybreaker felt something warm her heart, if briefly. Although her grin was fake at first, she felt it grow at least slightly genuine, and not nearly as forced.\n\n"It is not a real event, but it could be one day." In awe, Flurry, who still had jabbered at Daybreaker for the entire train ride back, turned to stare at her. For a second or two, Flurry's eyes sparkled, and then she exclaimed, "Neat! Maybe they'll make something of me, too!" She gasped. "Oh, maybe I could be riding a yak as they smash things for Yickslubertfest! That'd be funny!"\n\nStraining again, Daybreaker's smile grew razor thin. With palpably insincere interest, she exclaimed, "Of course! But first you have to promise to—" her horn lit up as Flurry started to trundle off toward a statue in the hallway "—promise to SIT STILL." Her outburst at the end made Flurry's ears wilt, and she held back a sniffle as the reflection of Daybreaker's mane bounced off her pupils.\n\nInstantly, Daybreaker grimaced and she sweetly clarified, "I mean, you must behave yourself while in the castle, of course." Flurry wiped her nose and nodded. Taking Flurry's disposition in for a second, Daybreaker leaned down. "But, if you promise to behave, and to listen to me, maybe we can do something—" she internally gagged "—fun later." She arched a brow. "Okay?"\n\nIn the back of her mind, she begged for Flurry to agree. It only took a couple of seconds for Flurry to affirm that, though, and she breathed a sigh.\n\n"Excellent!" Daybreaker exclaimed while picking Flurry up in her magic. Depositing her niece on her back, she stated, "Now, I think you might like your room. Your Auntie Sunrise used to live in it, and it still has her things.""

  solarreworked.236.d:0 "Daybreaker merely sneered as Cadance hung her head. What point was there to make anything other than threats? She was the one who held the cards and if Cadance didn't want to damn the Crystal Empire to the annals of history as a footnote, she'd agree. For a second or two, she almost considered chuckling, but she withheld her amusement.\n\nFinally, though, Cadance raised her head. Almost taken aback, Daybreaker caught the thinly veiled fury that was raging in her eyes. Cadance bared her teeth. "No," she snarled. She practically dug her hooves into the throne. She lunged to a standing position. Flaring her magic, she walked down toward Daybreaker, who took a step back defensively and powered her own horn.\n\nSparks sprayed off Cadance's head as she growled, "You may threaten me, you may threaten my ponies, but you can NEVER threaten my daughter!" At that, she stomped on the ground, the impact of her hoof managing to crack the crystal that comprised it. Cracks spread across it in jagged, uneven spiderwebs, almost reaching to where Daybreaker had placed herself.\n\n"Oh, so you do have some bite after all?" Daybreaker quipped as she spread her wings. Eagerly, she pawed at the floor and felt the heat washing off her mane intensify. Despite the sunlight that poured through the walls and windows, the throne room glowed a bright blue from the brightness of her fiery hair. She tittered, "So, did I upset the momma bear?"\n\nCadance snarled. Seconds later, a bolt of magic hurled toward Daybreaker's hooves, but Daybreaker didn't even dodge. It was clear that Cadance had purposefully aimed there.\n\nArching her brow, Daybreaker gazed directly at Cadance when her niece growled, "Leave, now."\n\n"I think—"\n\n"I said LEAVE!" At that, Cadance flung another bolt of pure energy at Daybreaker, this time aiming for one of her wings. Deftly deflecting the bolt with a quick shield spell, Daybreaker took another step back and then conjured a glob of fire next to her horn's tip.\n\nShe stared Cadance down, then let it drop. With a hiss, it spread across the crystal for a moment before she stamped it out with a hoof. It didn't even singe her fur. She narrowed her eyes at Cadance. "Fine," she hissed. "I shall let you live your last few days of freedom. Make peace with your family, Cadance."\n\nShe spun around. "Know you've condemned your daughter to a life of emotional torment." She didn't look back as she heard Cadance break down into tears."

Normally the white marble of these halls appeared so inviting and pure, but right now they were blinding as I focused on the throne room's doors.\n\n\The conversation that I had had with the Empress still echoed freshly in my mind. Never had I seen her so discomforted by a couple of ponies. Sure, Cadance was a reminder of the before times, but the Crystal Empire was insignificant compared to the Solar Empire! They clung to old, antiquated ways, believing that they were safe so long as their weak leaders promised them that they were living in unity. But were they really? Did Cadance believe that she could stave of something inevitable?\n\n"Enter," came the beckon from inside the Empress's throne room. Instantly, the raging beehive that had settled for a while in my stomach returned with a vengeance. As much as I held my head high, as ought my position as the Empress's student and grand inquisitor, I caught my knees knock against each other a couple of times.\n\nThe Empress stood, alone, looking out one of the windows. Down below, [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] could be seen covered in a haze as the morning mist that the pegasi were permitted to bring in still gripped the city. I breathed a sigh. Unlike a few days ago, the Empress's mane appeared much more tranquil. When she glanced my way, I immediately bowed.\n\nBarely constraining a smile, I asked, "What did you require of me, my Empress?"\n\nThe Empress bid me rise. As I did, eagerly, she motioned for me to approach. Another flare of excitement surged in my heart. Whenever I was close, it was like the world was safe and secure. I went to her side and she stated, "Sunrise, I realize you are still bent on your deception to Cadance, but you must not." She frowned. "There is much at stake. Millions of my ponies' lives in the balance. If you are apprehended as a spy, there is nothing that I or my ponies can do."\n\nIt was practically a stab in the gut. While I only slightly gasped, I strained a smile and inquired, "What would you have me do, my Empress?"\n\nShe stared at me. It was serene, solemn. There was power behind it. When she finally bared her teeth, she firmly declared, "Go, in my might. Ensure that Cadance can see what will happen if she refuses to submit herself to Harmony."\n\nI nodded. Although my hopes of a peaceful, possibly warm reconciliation had been dashed, there was nothing I could do. I looked to her. "I will pack my things." As I spun, I added, "I think the tailors have a new robe that will work perfectly.""

  solarreworked.238.d_a:0 "Like a smothering fog, tension hung over the Crystal City as crystal ponies slowly assembled toward the central train station of the capital. Uneasy glances, furtive looks, and worried gazes all belied the fear that gripped many of [CRY.GetNameDef]'s inhabitants. Normally, the Crystal Heart was alive and well, its warmth keeping the worst of the northern weather at bay, but for once, it was not the artifact maintaining the temperatures within the city. Rather, the sun itself seemed to be radiating heat, to an almost unbearable degree.\n\nIn silent anticipation, many of the ponies gathered watched as the personal train car of Daybreaker pulled into the station. Shortly, after a rehearsed military salute of dozens of blanks fired by the guards outside where the car stopped, a herald emerged and proclaimed Daybreaker's arrival. Within the line of soldiers, Princess Cadance stood patiently, although her posture betrayed her nerves. A few stray hairs had frayed and remained unkempt on her mane.\n\nWhen Daybreaker emerged from her car, Cadance stood slightly straighter and hardened her brow. She didn't bow.\n\nAs Daybreaker got within speaking distance, she curled her upper lip but remained quiet. The two alicorns stared at each other for a moment, and Daybreaker finally stated, "You made the correct choice, my niece."\n\nCadance's expression darkened. Although she wasn't outright fuming, the barely perceptible twitching in her right eyelid was something she couldn't quite hide. She forced a smile upon her face and replied lightly, "Well, when your terms were made so clear, what choice did I have?" Her grin was nothing but pure ice.\n\nSmirking, Daybreaker leaned forward almost into Cadance's muzzle. "You could have refused, and I would have enjoyed correcting you." She tittered. "But I agree. This is more expedient."\n\n"'Expedient.' Sure." Cadance flared her nostrils. After Daybreaker arched her brows expectantly, Cadance motioned for her to go forward, and she fell in step with the Empress. "I doubt this is a pleasure trip," Cadance grunted. Under her breath, she added, "Not that it would be pleasurable to any of us here."\n\n"Certainly if I wished to visit my niece, I could do so without any other reason," Daybreaker began with a sigh. Looking out from the station into the heart of the Crystal City, she spread her arms wide. "Today, [CRY.GetNameDef] will be a model of Order and Harmony. I intend that it gets the attention it deserves." She switched her gaze to Cadance. "We shall be seeing each other more, Cadance. Some aunt-niece time."\n\nBlowing a bit of her mane out of her face, Cadance grumbled, "Great. Awesome. Can't wait.""
  solarreworked.238.d_b:0 "Trumpets blared and ponies stood rigidly at attention as Daybreaker's personal train car pulled into the station of the Crystal City. Lines of soldiers dozens thick presented their guns and raised them high, providing a series of shots to signal the Empress's welcome. Throughout the streets surrounding the main station of the megalopolis, ponies teemed and crowded together, murmurs of excitement and fear mingling into an electric tension that could be tasted in the air.\n\nDespite the normally wintry weather that [CRY.GetNameDef] was known for, the temperature was far more comfortable than it normally was within the city, even with the Crystal Heart protecting it. The very sun itself seemed warmer, and flowers blossomed and bloomed sooner than any gardener had anticipated for the year.\n\nAt the head of the procession of soldiers, Sunrise Sparkle remained at attention, her posture straight and her eyes faceted on the door to Daybreaker's train. She licked her lips. Wriggling her wings, she smiled when a single herald exited the train and proclaimed the arrival the Empress. Eagerly bowing to the ground, Sunrise only caught a glimpse of Daybreaker's marvelous mane before she was prostrate. A series of hoofbeats approached, and then she heard her mentor state, "Rise."\n\nInstantly springing to her hooves, Sunrise fell in step with Daybreaker, who was casting her gaze at the various buildings before resting upon the Crystal Palace, which shot up like a giant spire above a vast valley. As it glinted in the sun, she inquired, "Tell me, Sunrise, have you acquainted yourself with [CRY.GetNameDef]?"\n\nNodding her head, Sunrise exclaimed, "Absolutely! Do you know how how many bits I saved in the first week by imprisoning most of the staff?" She giggled. "I cut the budget by eleven percent! Oh! And there were some laws on the books which just slowed things down, so those are out. Already went through most of those prisoners' trials!" At that, she pranced a bit closer to Daybreaker. "I even drew up some improvement plans for the palace, and—"\n\nDaybreaker held up a hoof. "You have been busy." Peering aside to Sunrise, she stated, "This is more than a pleasant visit. Today marks a new footnote in [CRY.GetNameDef]'s history!" She spread her forelegs and indicated the city. "Henceforth, your nation will be a model of Order and Harmony. Everything will be where it needs to be. Everypony will serve together!" She pointed at a park. "And I already have visions for how to reflect that in the city."\n\n"Oooh! Are they any science labs? I have so many ideas on lithovore biology that I could—" Sunrise cut herself off and blushed at Daybreaker's droll expression. "I'll... I'll just smile and nod, okay?""

At least, that's what Earthshine grumbled to himself as he tried to pull up the overcoat of his uniform. For the briefest moment, he blinked away the soft glint of silver on his rank bar. While just a lowly corporal, he was one of the few that were still truly free.\n\nRetreating to the Crystal Empire in the wake of Daybreaker wasn't cowardly. It was the only chance of survival. Although infrequent, he still heard the tales of what was going on to his thestral brethren in [EQS.GetNameDef]. Even the brief recollection of those stories made him shudder. Perhaps that was why his blood was running colder than ever.\n\nAs he finally managed to turn the neck of his uniform up enough to guard him from the bitter, icy air, he twitched an ear when he caught a slight sound. Twisting his head around, he strained and searched into the night, the dim lighting of the moon appearing closer to early dusk than the late hour it was. All he could see were the distant puffs of steam and smoke that rose from the houses of Rainbow Falls. While a fair distance, it was still their closest supply base. He'd never gone there, since it was reserved for the few non-thestrals who aided General Oil, but it had been useful for what support they needed for establishing the small bunker they had in the woods.\n\nHe jerked his attention another way. Suddenly, the temperature seemed to drop even further, and he lowered his rifle and flipped the safety off. There was absolutely somepony else here. Glancing to the ramshackle shelter that General Oil used as a front for his organizational bunker, he started to slink toward it for reinforcements when there was a sudden bolt of magic from behind one of the bushes approaching the bunker.\n\nBefore he could react, it impacted his chest, and he gagged. As warm blood trickled from his mouth, he coughed and peered down to see a gaping crater where it was hit. His world dimming, he collapsed in a heap and gurgled. He slowly dragged himself toward the shelter, the last of his strength threatening to give out, when there a small chime of another spell, and he heard somepony click their tongue. "Can't have you raising an alarm, El Nino."\n\nHe merely hacked up blood. Yet before he could even collapse in exhaustion as he bled out, there was another burst of magic, and he felt nothing at all."

Not bad, but the leaves were a smidgen old, and possibly were steeped a tad too long. A bit more bitter than a proper Duke Silver should be, but acceptable.\n\nCalmly setting her tea cup down, she smiled and stated nonchalantly, "My niece, you never write. I sense there's a rift between us."\n\n"You think?" Cadance quipped back with a nicker as she shot a glance toward Shining Armor, who was sitting next to her. At least, he was trying to, given that he was wriggling in discomfort and clearly restraining himself from lunging at Daybreaker. It only caused Daybreaker to grin further. Let him try.\n\nWith a playful pout, Daybreaker took another sip and then added with a small sigh, "Do you not enjoy speaking with your aunt? What happened to asking my advice and for my wisdom?"\n\n"Oh, I don't know," replied Cadance with a snarky cadence to her voice, "maybe it's the whole... YOU thing." She shrugged. Although she didn't snarl, and in fact guzzled some of her own tea, Daybreaker could see that Cadance was shivering. Excellent. Barely withheld fury. She was getting closer.\n\nHowever, Daybreaker put on a hurt demeanor. Wilting her ears and letting her mane grow a deeper shade of red, Daybreaker puffed out her cheeks and asked, "Really? I thought you'd want to be on good terms, what with the Crystal Empire returning to the fold." She snorted. "After all, I could simply let the yaks invade, or perhaps incite the changelings."\n\nCadance's left eye twitched. "Oh?" she finally asked. As her magic began to glow brighter, she bared her teeth and tilted her head, if slightly. "How thoughtful." She sipped on more tea, although there was a slight crack in it as she set it down. It shattered a few seconds later.\n\n"I-I'll get something to clean that up," Shining quickly stammered before galloping off. From the stomping on the ground alone, Daybreaker could sense his anger. She smiled.\n\n"Excellent," she stated and got up. "Now I can speak frankly." Daintily placing the tea cup down, Daybreaker strode toward Cadance, and leaned down. Cadance pulled back, but she met Daybreaker's gaze resolutely. "It would be such a shame if, perhaps, a changeling was missed and got to Flurry, now wouldn't it? Or, perhaps she falls in with the wrong crowd, and gets charged with crimes against Harmony." She nickered. "I can't bend laws."\n\nCatching a couple of tears in Cadance's eyes despite the defiant spread of her wings, Daybreaker sneered. "But not to worry, we're just chatting about possibilities. Nothing will happen. As long as Order is kept here, if you understand, my dearest Cadance.""

Surrounding her was the sound of busyness: the clack of keys, the scribbling of pencil on paper, or the din of conversation between coworkers. Yet she was just gazing at the page, daring it to write the report she had to complete for her. It wasn't that she didn't have the information, for she did. But how to put it nicely?\n\nHow exactly could a count of the number of ponies... dealt with, by the "protective" forces of Daybreaker be spun without decrying the entire thing? Should she use flowery language, or maybe she could simply classify them as disappearances instead? It wasn't like they were effectively treated like ponies that no longer existed, beyond the obvious. Something to kick back at Daybreaker?\n\nResting her hooves on her keyboard, she hummed and worked her jaw before she finally huffed and began to wallop on it. She growled. She was supposed to be penning up good things, not statistics on how many had been eliminated in a year because of some paranoid alicorn. Although it took her a minute to get the opening preamble right, she sat back and nickered when it finally was finished in about another five minutes. Not her best work, but also not the worst.\n\nBefore she could move on further, though, there was an abrupt crash on the office door. She bolted up, glancing over her cubicle walls and seeing soldiers march past the window which looked out toward the Crystal Palace. Her coworkers shrieked as some were snatched by the troopers.\n\nAlthough her heart shot through her chest, Cloudy froze as her brain practically shut down. The soldiers tackled Ruby Glow as she attempted to sneak away, and her screams echoed through Cloudy's head as she finally realized others were coming for her. As her mind finally caught up, she was yanked before she could move and hauled toward the window, where many others were being lined up.\n\nShortly, the chaos of the assault died down, and an officer walked through the now-broken door and sniffed. "This ministry will now be shut down," he stated without so much as an air of derision. Glancing at each one who was restrained, he added, "And you all, you have much to discuss." He stared at Cloudy. "Some very interesting topics, regarding irregularities in your... loyalties." He sneered, and clapped his hooves.\n\nCloudy gulped."

When he laid eyes upon the trio, his horn sputtered and sparked, but nothing came of it. With the pulses of energy, the tight inhibitor ring on his horn crackled and sent small jolts down through its base and into his skull.\n\nJust a gentle reminder to not do anything rash.\n\nWhen he was finally placed before the three officers, he stood proudly and defiantly, his eyes narrowed as he met each of their gazes once. "Prince Shining Armor," the officer in the center, a grey pegasus with a burnt orange mane, began with a sniff. He flipped through a couple of pages. "I trust you know exactly why you've been taken here."\n\nShining nickered. "Oh, probably to put me on some display for Cel—Daybreaker, to show how 'evil' I am, right?" The only response he received was a stern glower from the pegasus. Stepping a couple of paces forward and immediately being shoved back by the guards there, he added, "And, probably, because I'm guilty of some crime that I committed, I'll have to be put to death by firing squad. Am I on the right track here?"\n\nInstead of responding, the pegasus merely marked something down on a sheet of paper. After shooting glances between his fellow officers, he stated, "Let it be known that General Scorched Earth of Her Majesty's Solaris Militarium will render final judgement." There was a quick notation by a mare off in a corner.\n\n"Shining Armor," Scorched Earth declared, focusing his attention back on Shining. "You have been accused of anti-Order actions, beginning with the harboring of Lunarist scum in the Crystal Empire. Do you defend yourself?"\n\n"Oh, sure, and it'll definitely help my case!" Shining spat back. With a wry grin, he added, "I'm sure that Daybreaker will have mercy upon me, or something like that. I defended the Empire and Harmony for years. My conscience is clear." At that, he held his head high, and pursed his lips.\n\nMomentarily, the room was silent as Scorched Earth and his compatriots conferred between each other. Scorched finally sighed and looked to him. "Due to the need for stability, we have deemed you fit to go free." There was a small glint in his eye. "But only as a civilian.

Although they were keeping their hooves far from the trigger, the subtle message they were sending was clear.\n\nLike she had been slapped across the muzzle, Cadance merely blinked in shock. Occasionally her ears twitched and she slowly furrowed her brow and glanced around the throne room. She met the gazes of a few of the courtiers and steeled herself by drawing herself straighter.\n\nDrawing her shoulders back and gazing at Cadance with a slightly upraised nose, Nova merely held her smirk and glared deeply into Cadance's soul. As the stillness dragged on, Nova at last stated, her voice effectively dripping with confidence, "Choose wisely, Princess." She took a step back. "The God-Empress does not treat sin kindly."\n\nCadance locked eyes with her. Briefly frowning, her posture slumped and she rested her head on a hoof. She grimaced. In response, a couple of the guards glanced at her, concern etched on their faces, and she waved them back. "What can I do?" she weakly asked aloud. Although her composure signaled her defeat, she still shot defiant daggers at the inquisitor. "Fine. We submit. Inform your 'goddess' that [CRY.GetNameDef] shall rejoin the [ROOT.GetFactionName]." Sigh moaned.

Her declaration had muted the room, and the guards nearest Cadance were now nervously fiddling with their weapons. Although they were still at parade rest, they watched Raven intently for any sudden movement, which made Raven roll her eyes.\n\nCadance worked her jaw. Flicking her ears a few times in deep concentration, she met Raven's gaze and then sighed and drew herself upright. She quickly looked at some of the courtiers and almost invisibly her frustrated expression softened. At Cadance's hesitation, Raven stepped forward, but stopped when the remaining guards suddenly lowered their rifles to aim at her. She held up her hooves defensively.\n\nMeeting Cadance's gaze, she stated, "Please don't make this harder than it already is, Princess."\n\n"Is it really hard, Raven?" Cadance countered as she leaned forward. For a moment, she stared past Raven, then she groaned, "Daybreaker would truly see our empire burnt to the ground if I refuse?" When Raven remained tight-lipped, Cadance hung her head. "Of course she would.\n\n"Fine," she began, wincing as she drew herself back up. With as much pride as she could visibly muster, she stared defiantly at Raven and proclaimed, "Inform Daybreaker that [CRY.GetNameDef] will return to [ROOT.GetFactionName]." She rubbed her forehead.

Glancing at the guards again, she indicated them to Cadance, and Cadance motioned for them to stand down before returning to massaging her temples. Raven approached the throne. She paused a foot away from Cadance. With a bit of hesitation, she finally rested a hoof on Cadance's shoulder and stated, "I'll let her know. You'll get used to it in time." At that, she pulled back and added, "Give my regards to Shining and Flurry."\n\nCadance bobbed her head once.

Although they had their hooves far from the trigger of their guns, they could react if the made any move toward Cadance.\n\nHowever, Cadance was already drawing herself up, after she briefly furrowed her brow and worked her jaw in thought. Her eyes sparkled, and the faintest of tears were visible on their edge. Taking a quivering sigh, Cadance sat perfectly straight, and she scowled. "No."\n\nLike she had been bucked in the face, Nova staggered back a couple of steps with an audible scoff. Her expression bewildered, she searched the floor momentarily before she looked back up at Cadance, her muzzle twisted into a snarl. "'No?!'" she echoed, her volume barely below a shout.\n\nCadance inhaled. Tone cool and firm, she stated back, "You heard me, inquisitor. We will not submit." Leaning forward slightly, she glared directly into Nova's gaze and growled, "We will not be intimidated by a tyrant. [CRY.GetNameDefCap] is united against all forms of oppression, even yours." Shadow's cast from the windows shrouding her nose and face, she continued with a hiss, "I suggest you leave."\n\nFuming and snorting, Nova Glow pawed at the ground a couple of times, the shoe on her hoof scraping and scratching on the crystal.

Whose Sun is the guardian of Harmony?!"\n\n"Yes, and I advise you depart, before this interaction turns truly hostile, inquisitor," Cadance calmly stated, nodding to two of her guards. As a unit, they marched toward Nova, their guns trained steadily on her. Nova merely switched her gaze between the two of them.\n\n"You bring damnation upon your heads!" Nova finally bellowed as she moved back, all the while keeping the two soldiers in her sight. Occasionally her horn sputtered and sparked, but she didn't act. As the inquisitors filed out, Nova was the last to leave. Keeping the door to the throne room held in her grip, she looked over her shoulder and snapped, "Your ponies' blood and ash is on your hooves, Princess!"\n\nAs Nova slammed the door, Cadance collapsed in her throne, shoulders shivering with sobs."

Still, she eyed them carefully and continued tapping one of her forehooves as she waited on Cadance.\n\nCadance rubbed her chin a couple of times, and then drew herself straighter. As she worked her jaw, she shook her head. There was a faint glimmer of tears in her eyes. She swallowed and looked directly at Raven. "No."\n\nRaven blinked. Shoulders slumping slightly, she sighed and pushed back a small lock of her mane that had escaped its bun. "Princess," she solemnly stated, "I urge you to reconsider." Although a couple of the [CRY.GetAdjective] guards lowered their guns to train on Raven as she moved toward Cadance, Cadance waved them off.\n\nWhen she got within a couple of feet of Cadance, Raven stopped. "Daybreaker has offered you a chance of reconciliation. Please think of what would happen if—"\n\n"I HAVE, Raven," interjected Cadance. Scowling and leaning forward in her seat, she glowered directly into Raven's eyes and shot the emissary a baleful look. She grimaced. "I have. We will not bow down to Daybreaker. We will not be intimidated any tyrant, even her." Steepling her hooves together, she added, "We are all united against her idea of 'order.'"\n\nWhen she finished, Raven's ears wilted and she let out a small whinny. Grinding her teeth together for a second, Raven finally mumbled, "I see. You will not reconsider? She will not take kindly to this."\n\n"I've made my choice, Raven." Cadance paused. Hardening her gaze, she continued with a morose sigh, "Just like you've made yours." Before Raven could open her mouth, she stated, "Go. We've nothing more to discuss."\n\nRaven clammed up momentarily. As a couple of guards started to walk toward her, she stepped back and protested that she was leaving. The guards that came with her were already beginning to file out as she stepped down from the path to the dais and made her way to the exit. As she stood at the doorway, she halted and looked behind her. Cadance still sat straight.\n\nNodding again, Raven declared, "Give my best wishes to Shining and Flurry. I'm sorry that it had to be this way." The door boomed shut.\n\nCadance swallowed. "Me, too, Raven. Me, too.""

  ###Civil War Events###
  solarreworked.251.t:0 "Night Against Day"
  solarreworked.251.d:0 "The fear was palpable.\n\nOnly this thought rushed through Daybreaker's mind as she marched out onto the balcony overlooking the courtyard and streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Practically the entirety of the city was out, their throngs filling the courtyard to the brim, spilling into the alleys and roads beneath, and even out toward the various marketplaces and squares that sprouted up throughout the ages.\n\nTo Daybreaker's left, Raven Inkwell finished scribbling a final few words onto a sheet of paper that she had on a clipboard, then tore it off. She floated it to Daybreaker. When Daybreaker snatched it, she read the short message and gave a slow, weary sigh. More word from the front. Where she should be, burning the animals that dared defy her to the ground!\n\nBriefly, she felt her mane grow hotter and her she gritted her teeth together, but she soon exhaled and went to the very edge of the balcony, to lean over the railing. For a moment she sized up her ponies, and the din of worried and harrowed conversation slowly died off as ponies from all over the city watched her. The air was so tense, if somepony so much as breathed too loudly, it might shatter.\n\nDaybreaker straightened. "My little ponies, these months have been filled with danger, with sorrow, and with loss. The harmony that we all once shared has been destroyed, trampled under the hooves of those who would dare claim that they fight for justice. What justice do they deliver? They've brought death. They've brought pain."\n\nStomping a hoof on the balcony, she sensed its vibrations carry through the entire structure. A couple of cracks formed on the floor. Most likely, it was loud enough that ponies could hear it from a distance, as she saw a few of her ponies cringe away at her outburst of frustration.\n\nAs she cast a calming spell over them, she added, "But you have nothing to fear. The rot and decay that has plagued our systems is being expunged as I speak to you. The traitors have shown their true colors. They will not threaten our Harmony." Her mane flaring brightly, she snapped, "They wish to fight our unity! They wish to defy ME! Know that when you see one of them, no matter who they were, they are nothing more than a creature of base desires and hatred!"\n\nA few, tentative cheers started to build, and she spat derisively, "Let them come to us! Let them face the fires of our Order! Let them burn in the fires of Tartarus!""
  solarreworked.251.a:0 "They will face the light of my Sun!"
  solarreworked.252.t:0 "Pep Talk 101"
  solarreworked.252.d:0 ""You there!" At the declaration, a stallion who was ambling by Loud Mouth glanced in both directions, then pointed at himself with a forehoof. Her outburst had garnered the attention of a couple of other pedestrians, who had stopped to watch the mare as she stepped back a few paces and reached a central stand that had been erected in the middle of the square. Since his confusion was more than apparent, Loud Mouth nodded her head and added, "Yes, of course I'm talking to you!"\n\n"W-What do you want from me?" he stuttered as he scrutinized her. Given that she was wearing a pin that showed support for the Empress. A simple, brilliant flame embossed on a bit of copper.\n\nWith a swish of her tail, Loud Mouth grinned and asked, "Why are you here instead of out on the front lines, fighting for Harmony's survival?" She nickered in mock disgust.\n\nAs his ears wilted and he drew back a couple of paces, he exclaimed, "I-I've got a reason! I am—"\n\n"Afraid?" she interjected, which earned a few glances from more ponies in the crowd. By this point, a small group had assembled and watched the altercation. Loud Mouth grinned. Whether this stallion actually had a reason or not was irrelevant, it was all in getting the crowd on her side.\n\n"I think he's just a little scared, don't you agree?" she inquired, casting her gaze at the various ponies around her. Some shook their heads, others nodded. For his part, the stallion appeared mortified. He stammered and stuttered a few times, but never quite formed the words his brain was probably wanting.\n\n"Tell me, do you enjoy your life here?" As he nodded, she went on with a whinny, "And do you believe it should be defended." Again, another nod, and she went on while looking at the crowd, "And what would happen if you were all afraid? Who would fight for Harmony then? Just the Empress? You can't leave her alone, can you? She who ensures your freedom must be protected out of love, no?"\n\n"I supp—"\n\n"And what better way than to bring every bastard who rebelled against her down?!" At that, a few flecks of spit flew from Loud's mouth, and she added, "What do they know about our way of life? What do they know of Harmony? They caused this problem to begin with! They chose to live outside of it! They must face the consequences!"\n\nThrowing a hoof up, she demanded, "Who's with me?!"\n\nAt first, only a couple followed her example, then a few more. Reluctantly at last, the stallion raised his hoof, too, and she grinned. All too easy."
  solarreworked.252.a:0 "Now keep that enthusiasm for basic."
  solarreworked.258.t:0 "Emo Phase Over"
  solarreworked.258.d:0 "Every step felt like it'd send her over the sun as Daybreaker marched ahead of a dozen guards, each wearing ceremonial armor, as she she blazed the way through the damp tunnels of the Imperial Palace's prison. Surrounded on all sides by Daybreaker's soldiers, four different-sized magic inhibitor rings on her horn, Nightmare Moon, stripped of her regalia, trudged after them. She held her head low.\n\nClicking her tongue tiredly, Daybreaker glanced back and shook her head. With a twisted, almost corrupted motherly smile, she inquired, "Come now, Lulu, why are you so upset?" She tittered. "You almost managed to put up a fight. You simply had to get a makeover." At that, her giggle turned into a guffaw, and Nightmare Moon flattened her ears against her skull.\n\nAs they wove their way through the hallways, they finally arrived at a single cell with nary a view out into [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Daybreaker held up a hoof. Motioning with it, she indicated that all but two guards leave her, and they meekly obeyed. While their hoofbeats faded, Daybreaker nodded her head at the door, and one of the remaining troopers unlocked it with a key. In turn, the door clanked and reverberated through the chamber. The door moved half an inch, then Daybreaker grinned as stepped forward and lightly slid her horn into a horn-sized hole in a separate lock. Her magic flickered momentarily, and then the door swung the rest of the way.\n\nMockingly, she bowed and ushered Nightmare Moon inside. When Nightmare Moon refused, she scowled and one of the guards got behind the other alicorn and shoved. With a grunt, Nightmare Moon stumbled forward. Daybreaker slammed the door behind her.\n\nWhen it was sealed, she inquired, "Appreciate the accommodations, sister?" She tapped on the cell door. "Designed just to hold you." She tapped her horn. "No magic for you, and only I can get inside."\n\nNightmare Moon merely scowled. "I will not stroke your ego by begging for mercy."\n\nDaybreaker's breath hitched. With a snigger, she wiped at one of her eyes and exclaimed, "'Beg for mercy?' How droll!" She giggled. Shaking her head, she declared, "Killing you is too EASY, sister." She pressed against the door. "Everypony will see what happens to those who try to USURP me!" She shouted as she finished and beat against the door. Both guards jumped.\n\nAs Nightmare Moon's mane swished furiously, Daybreaker tittered. "You'll have all of eternity to think about your actions, sister. Maybe I'll let you out to play, see what you tried to achieve, and couldn't." She tapped her chin. "Could be in a thousand years? Do you like that?"\n\nWhen Nightmare Moon remained silent, Daybreaker cackled and sauntered off. "I thought you would!""
  solarreworked.259.t:0 "Mare Fight"
  solarreworked.259.d:0 "With a rapid dive, Daybreaker dodged a beam of brilliant, electric cyan magic, which crackled just above her chest. As she pulled out, she spun and cackled, briefly catching the cloud of dirt and debris that it kicked up from the battlefield below. Most of the fighting had died down, and only a few cracks of gunfire occasionally sputtered up, but were almost immediately drowned out by the thunderous claps of magic impacting magic.\n\nTo the ground, she was certain that she was nothing more than an orange blob, but still, they were getting a show as the two alicorns traced offensive spells through the air.\n\nDucking to the side, she deflected another bolt of energy headed toward her, and she yawned. "Please, Luna," she drawled as she summoned a shield which absorbed a third blast. With an irritated frown, she asked, "I thought you were stronger? Isn't what this whole emo getup is about?"\n\n"Silence!" Nightmare Moon boomed in response, zooming toward Daybreaker, her horn snapping and popping with magic. Daybreaker caught the glow in Nightmare Moon's hooves, just in time to don a hasty defense spell. Before she had a chance to do much more, Nightmare Moon slammed, full force, into her and they both tumbled toward the earth.\n\nDaybreaker shrieked. As they fell, Nightmare Moon attempted to hold her down and hold her down and steady, but Daybreaker kicked and bucked enough to knock her off. However, with only milliseconds to impact, she was unable to react before she cratered into the grass. As she skid to a halt, her chin burned as if her skin was melting off from the friction.\n\nEvery bone was like lava. For a few seconds, she barely could steady her legs as she hauled herself up. Panting and wiping at her jaw, her pristinely ivory fur came back soaked crimson. She snorted. It figured.\n\nStaggering forward, she flapped her wings once and moaned when there was a jerk in one of the sockets. No way she'd be flying at the moment. Instead, she limped toward Nightmare Moon's impact crater while she silently drew upon the strength of the sun. As its warmth filled her, her horn began to pulse red, and she giggled, "Oh, Lulu! I've come to help give you a bit COLOR to your attire!"\n\nWhen she arrived, she could see a trail of red, and a short distance away, Nightmare Moon gasping as she hauled herself further from the rim of the ripped up dirt. Both she and Daybreaker their gazes, and Daybreaker sneered. "Goodbye, Lulu," Daybreaker tittered, although she spotted Nightmare Moon smirk, just as her body was encased in the same electric cyan, and disappeared with a pop.\n\nA second later, Daybreaker's fireball impacted, belching out flames that engulfed even where she stood. As the tongues of fire died, her lips twitched as the sounds of approaching motorcades could be heard, and the empty spot where her sister had been mocked her."

  ###Industry Tree Events###
  solarreworked.263.t:0 "Live Fire Results"
  solarreworked.263.d:0 ""It is so exciting, yes, incredibly exciting that you are here, Empress!" Pinpoint proclaimed as she looked back at Daybreaker, who was traipsing casually behind her. On either side of Daybreaker, a heavily armed guard ensured that she was untouched as she walked toward the laboratories that had been furnished within Bales Thaumaturgic. The light blue unicorn giggled almost uncontrollably, and Daybreaker suppressed the urge to roll her eyes.\n\n"We have spent many a moon crunching the numbers." Pinpoint briefly lolled her head to the side. "And also a few of those rebel skulls." With a disgusted nicker, she added, "I care not how others complain. Doctor Beaker's work is far more important than... ethics, or whatever the other scientist ponies call them." As a scowl formed on her face, she gestured to a door. "We're here, Empress!"\n\nGiddily pressing the door open, she trotted in and declared, "Doctor Beaker! Something requires your attention." When the older stallion in the room, who was fiddling with a pony currently held on a rack and poked clean through with different needles and wires, didn't react to her, she snapped, "Doctor! Visitors! Now!"\n\nAt that, he jumped up in shock, and whirled around to peer for a second at Daybreaker before bowing hastily. When Daybreaker bid him rise, he sidled up to Pinpoint and hissed, "I thought you were joking. You were joking, right? This can't be her! Here?"\n\n"In the flesh," Daybreaker interjected with a tired drawl. Pursing her lips and looking at the test subject, she inquired, "Your assistant has promised me the world, but can you both deliver? Why do you need a pony test subject."\n\n"You jest, Empress!" Pinpoint quipped with a small titter. "That is no pony! That is only a rebel. Who cares? They have meaningless lives, anyway."\n\nAt that, Doctor Bunsen Beaker nodded. "Yes, yes, yes." He thrust up a hoof as he started walking back to the pony. "I had ideas. Many ideas!" With a snigger, he added, "It just required a few cut corners, perhaps a few bribes, and—" Before he finished, he grabbed a lever, and then pulled.\n\nAt first, nothing seemed to happen, and then there were a few crackles of energy around the rebel. The pony, a mare, squirmed and whimpered, before finally Bunsen released the lever. He grinned. "That was just a one percent load," he stated. Whipping up a hoof again, he clarified, "No way to kill an interrogation target. It simply focuses on their magical essence, and... lights a fire under it." With a glint in his eye, he asked, "Would you like to see more?"\n\nDaybreaker hummed."
  solarreworked.263.a:0 "Can you make it hurt more?"
  solarreworked.264.t:0 "Fix It in Post"
  solarreworked.264.d:0 "Soylent Green gave a small sigh as she tapped a hoof impatiently on the board room's desk. As the vibrations carried through the wood, it garnered the attention of a couple of her peers, as they all listened to Viscosity prattle on about some of the latest theoretical results from the sample tests in his lab in Baltimare. She scratched a couple of things onto a clipboard.\n\nGlancing out the room's window, she casually observed the guards that had begun to round up a few civilians that were outside the building. In her mind, she counted the bits that they'd have to be paid afterward, and she huffed. It wasn't like money grew on trees, even if the Empress acted like it did. Thankfully, the Empress had trusted her and the others listening to Viscosity to execute proper judgement on what would be worthwhile pursuits in maintaining Order and Harmony.\n\nAs Viscosity flipped a sheet of paper in his presentation, Soylent raised a hoof and declared tiredly, "Those details are all fine, but we can cover them later, after your field test. That is why you're here today, no?" She shot him a bemused stare.\n\nAfter a couple of seconds, he nodded and muttered, "I suppose I got carried away. I only wanted to make sure everything was correct!" He wrung his hooves together. "After all, the funds are getting a BIT dry right now." He coughed. "You know, because of bits that are used for—"\n\n"Yes. Droll," Soylent grunted. As she marked another thing down on her clipboard, she asked, "Are the subjects ready?"\n\n"They should be gathered by now..." he replied with a scratch of his chin. "I believe I gave the guards explicit instructions on who to fetch." With a shrug, he added with a quick wave of a foreleg. "Shall we go to the pathology lab?" When the scientists gathered wordlessly agreed, he nickered and soon they arrived in a sterile, clean room, behind a glass wall.\n\nWith a small sparkle in his eyes, Viscosity proclaimed when he saw the ponies that Soylent noticed being rounded up waiting on the other side. He rubbed his hooves together. "Perfect! Now—" he keyed a microphone "—you shall all be compensated for your sacrifices. Now, please don't hold your breath."\n\nAs one of the ponies began to protest, he slammed a button on a console in the room, and abruptly jets of green gas shot up from the floor. The subjects gagged and collapsed, convulsing in pain. Viscosity cackled. "Perfect! Incapacitates like expected. Now, if I could—"\n\nBefore he could finish, some of the subjects began to shriek as horrid, festering boils began to build on them. He hummed. "Perhaps it needs to be tweaked," he muttered. "Although I suppose mild injury fits within the Empress's parameters." Spinning around to the scientists, he chuckled. "No big, deal, right?""
  solarreworked.264.a:0 "Now about that grant..."
  solarreworked.265.t:0 "Imperial Electives"
  solarreworked.265.d:0 ""I-I-I-I beg your pardon, E-Empress, but could you repeat that?" Morning Veil blinked rapidly as her brain reran the words that Daybreaker had just spoken. As it did, she blankly gazed at Daybreaker, who was sitting across from her desk. If her wits had been around herself more, Morning's heart would have most likely been running a mile a minute, but instead, it was her head that felt like it was being taken for a ride.\n\nFor a moment, Daybreaker simply stared back at Morning. A wry smile played upon her lips, and she sipped at the tea that she had been provided. Morning's own cup sat without having been touched. The steam that had once wafted up from it had long since disappeared.\n\nWhen Daybreaker had finished her cup, she replied calmly, "You heard exactly what I said." She snorted. "I don't need to repeat myself."\n\nStammering and sputtering, Morning Veil finally shook her head and declared, "B-But to retool our entire school! I know that the... disagreements here are no more, but—"\n\nDaybreaker's eyes flashed furiously. "Yes? Rector? Is there a problem?"\n\nMorning gulped. Anxiously grinning, she tapped her forehooves together and tittered, "A-Ah, of course n-not, Your Majesty, it's just—" she scratched the back of her head "—how do I put this?" Glancing about the room and resting her gaze on some of her academic achievement that were hanging on the wall, she sighed and hung her head. "We have no experienced faculty who can instruct in military theory?" At that, her nervous posture grew more pronounced, and she whinnied uncomfortably.\n\nRemaining silent for a moment, Daybreaker merely poured herself another cup of tea, and she stated, "Hire some. There are still vacancies after the last round of resignations. Money is not an object." She grinned. "After all, you've done well to promote Order within these halls. I don't need to motivate you again, do I?"\n\nBriefly growing pale, Morning started and rapidly shook her head. At that, Daybreaker again supped on her tea, and she stated, "Good. I expect that a... oh, let's say, fifty percent budget increase will suffice for recompensing current students and hiring completely new staff?"\n\nMorning squeaked.\n\nAs a smirk flitted across her mouth, Daybreaker declared, "Excellent! I'll ensure it is done." She rose to her hooves, her mane sending a wave of heat over Morning. When she reached the door of Morning's office, Daybreaker paused. "Oh, and Rector?" She grabbed her used teacup in her magic. Instantly, it burst into flame and turned to ash. "Don't disappoint me, understood?""
  solarreworked.265.a:0 "Clear as Crystal, Empress."
  solarreworked.266.t:0 "Innovation's Fee"
  solarreworked.266.d:0 ""Oh, not them again," Daybreaker grumbled to herself, placing a forehoof to her left temple and slowly massaging it. She waved Raven off when her assistant noticed her demeanor. Resting her eyes upon the two stallions that had been announced and allowed to open the doors to her throne room themselves, she slowly felt a gnawing sensation build in the pit of her stomach.\n\n\"Why, I say, my dear brother, it is another glorious day today, is it not?" the first one asked as he adjusted his straw hat and glanced to his mustached companion.\n\n"Absolutely, my good brother. It's always a sunny day when we—"\n\n"Flim, Flam," Daybreaker interjected, which caused the stallions to jump and stare at her expectantly, "must you always repeat this game?" Groaning softly, she rose from her throne and descended the dais to the floor, each step she took thudding heavily as she forced every iota of irritation into them. Flim and Flam remained stoic, although she could barely catch them flinching as she stomped toward them.\n\nWhen she drew near, they bowed and she tiredly bid them to rise. "We have another tantalizing weapon to tickle your fancy!" Flam declared as he got up. Clapping his hooves together, he placed his attention on Flim, and the unicorn's horn lit and a large firearm with a scope and belt feed appeared. It was already loaded.\n\n"Now, do we have a fine volunteer for the Super Speedy Lead Burster Two Thousand?" Flim inquired loudly, spinning around to gesture at the guards who were stationed at the door and elsewhere. "You there!" He pointed to one of the door guards. Daybreaker motioned for the soldier to move up. As the trooper did, Flim continued, "Do your fighters have trouble seeing enemies far away? Do they wish they could fill entire armies with bullets from a distance? Well, wait no longer, as the Super Speedy Lead Burster Two Thousand—patent pending—will fill that need!"\n\n"Our unique design mixes the range of a Lila Rifle with the rate of fire of the Limestone. Why worry about what can hit you when you outrange them AND outgun them?" With a small chuckle, Flam passed the rifle to the guard. Flim summoned a target and placed it across the throne room.\n\n"If this explodes when the trigger is pulled..." Daybreaker began with a growl. She nodded to the guard.\n\nWhen he fired, the gun knocked straight back, hitting him the muzzle. He collapsed, and bullets sprayed everywhere, which Daybreaker blocked through a quick shield spell on the ponies in the throne room. As Flim and Flam gulped nervously, she sighed and grumbled, "You'll get your contract in the morning. Just fix the recoil already...""

  solarreworked.267.d:0 "Daybreaker sipped on her tea.\n\n"I can't believe that I'm being subjected to such an indignity!" her guest protested as he squirmed and fumed across the table from her. She merely smiled. As he glowered at her, she sipped again on her tea and then daintily set it aside, next to a large stack of tomes that had been placed on the right side of the table.\n\n"Chancellor Neighsay," she began, her voice dripping with false understanding, "I can completely see your point of view, but—" she shrugged "—I'm afraid that I will have to be insistent."\n\nNeighsay, his cyan eyes burning with fury, quivered and shook with rage. While his cheeks turned a deep shade of purple, he snarled, "I will NOT see the EEA turned into nothing more than a mouthpiece for whatever propaganda you purport to be scientific fact! We have standards! We have codes! We have—"\n\n"Almost no funding left," Daybreaker interjected, as she wrote something down on a napkin near her tea. She stuck out her tongue thoughtfully. "By my quick and dirty math, I'd say... you're at approximately... oh, five percent funding as when you entered." When she stated that, she sneered when he gagged in shock and his eyes went wide.\n\n"That's preposterous! I was assured—"\n\n"You were assured nothing! We met to discuss the new EEA curriculum, and how to properly educate our ponies, but you, sadly, believed that it was 'propaganda' and 'brainwashing'." She clicked her tongue. "It'd be such a shame that you'll be remembered as the last Chairpony of the EEA, and the one that led to its demise." Pursing her lips in an expression of mock compassion. "So sad," she pouted.\n\n"B-But I shall not—"\n\n"And that's four percent remaining."\n\n"Y-You can't—"\n\n"Three percent."\n\n"T-These are nothing but—"\n\n"Two percent."\n\n"Fine! Fine!" Neighsay screamed, throwing himself against the table, which made it rattle and spill tea onto his impeccably clean, red tunic. "I will implement the new curriculum! I can't have my legacy destroyed!"\n\nStaying silent for a moment, Daybreaker grinned. She sipped on her tea."

  solarreworked.268.d:0 ""Enter."\n\nAt the bidding, Daybreaker pushed the door to Chancellor Neighsay's office open. Sauntering in, she grinned when she saw Neighsay hunched over a number of books on his desk, his forehooves pressing into his forehead as she poured over them. With a mock bow, she simply declared, "Chancellor Neighsay. I heard you were having... issues." She grinned.\n\nScrambling to sit up, Neighsay creased his brow and glared directly at Daybreaker. "Yes, yes! Of course I'm having problems!" He gestured with both his hooves at the books. "Do you realize how much of a headache all these 'improvements' you've FORCED through the EEA are?" He floated up one of the books and cleared his throat.\n\n"'Unicorns are the most advanced of the three pony tribes, as they contain the most power of Harmony within them, like their Empress.'" He slammed the tome shut. Daybreaker sneered.\n\n"I don't see the problem."\n\n"Don't you?" Neighsay tossed the book to the floor. Jabbing one of his hoofs onto the desk, he bellowed, "Do you know how much needless division this will cause? The complaints from parents as when they—"\n\n"They will not."\n\n"Oh, I don't see how you're so certain." A few veins on Neighsay's forehead bulged and pulsed. Faintly, his jaw twitched and ground his teeth together. "If you expect me to take this lying down, EMPRESS, then you are sorely mistaken. I'm still the EEA's director, and I—"\n\n"Will be resigning."\n\n"What?" Neighsay momentarily blanched.\n\nBearing her teeth in a sinister grin, Daybreaker sashayed closer to Neighsay's desk. She rested her forelegs' elbows on it and propped up her chin. With a cheeky titter, she stated, "You will have a conflict of interest, as it's revealed you had a hoof in a rival curriculum, and will recuse yourself of any decision making."\n\nShe puffed out her lips. "And I'll find a suitable replacement. Somepony who knows their place." Her eyes sparked. "I suppose Superintendent Assent from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] would do the job nicely."\n\n"T-That sycophant?!" Turning a beet red, Neighsay quivered, then he snarled, "You know this 'conflict of interest' is a lie! There is no—"\n\n"Oh, my agents have found many interesting things, Chancellor."\n\n"You won't—"\n\n"Won't I?" Daybreaker bat her eyelashes at him.\n\nFor a second, Neighsay studied her. He gritted his teeth. With a resigned, furious sigh, he hung his head. "Fine. The curriculum goes through."\n\nDaybreaker patted his head."

  ###Political Events###
  ###God-Empress###
  solarreworked.300.t:0 "Nation of Light"
  solarreworked.300.d:0 "[3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] was on fire. Not through actual flames, but rather the buzz of conversation and the tension of those who had been assembled through the streets. From on high, the Sun poured down on the city, its golden rays warming the populace and causing rippling waves of heat to waft up from the pavement and cobblestone. As she stood beside the God-Empress, the only pony with Daybreaker, a white earth pony, excitedly glanced between the crowds and the alicorn.\n\nShe practically rattled with energy. With a side-eyed glance, Daybreaker furrowed Her brow. "Calm yourself, High Priestess," She grunted, which only made the earth pony titter in response. Daybreaker sighed. She stepped to the side, toward a newly-crafted, large ring of pure gold, which was held aloft and on its side by a sturdy pillar. She shot one glance back at the earth pony. "Speak, Padlock. I must perform the christening."\n\nWith a small jolt, Padlock switched her attention between the God-Empress and the crowds below. Scattered in between the ponies were uncountable numbers of guards, and some of them were also paying attention to her, too. Padlock swallowed and she straightened out her clerical robes.\n\nA unicorn to her right powered his horn, and she proclaimed, amplified by the mage's spell, "Ponies of the Imperium Solaris, hear my words this day! We stand on the verge of witnessing the divine! Our God-Empress, Daybreaker, hallowed be Her name, has proclaimed this old city no more! Instead, we shall see Her cleanse the ancient Canterlot and bring a new sanctum to the Sun, holy and pure, to us all!"\n\nAs Padlock finished, Daybreaker flapped evenly up to the center of the suspended ring and ignited her horn. In a flash of blinding light, the ring was engulfed in flame, and the Sun itself grew a brighter orange. With a gush of heat that pulsed from the center stage, beams of energy shot from where Daybreaker hovered. Wherever they impacted, flame sprung up and pillared into the sky. Ponies screamed and backpedaled from the magic.\n\nWatching for a second, Padlock exclaimed, "Fear not the God-Empress's magic!" She reached out a hoof to a nearby of pillar and stuck it in. Shortly, she withdrew to reveal an undamaged limb, albeit cleaner than before. Nopony could see the latter detail. Yet, her action did appear to cool the panic that could be tasted.\n\nAs more pulses of heat shot out from the dais, Padlock cried, "Embrace Her warmth! Embrace Her protection as she sanctifies this city! In this Sanctum Solar, come to bow to Her Harmony!" Each word she emphasized by hitting a forehoof on the dais. "Praise Her forever! Praise! SOL INVICTUS!"\n\nPonies didn't move at first, but slowly a chorus built through the crowd. Padlock smiled."
  solarreworked.300.a:0 "SOL INVICTUS!"

  solarreworked.301.d:0 "Carefully stepping into the darkened room, Dawnbreak Shimmer listened to her hooves clip and clop on the marble stonework of the room in the palace she had been summoned to. Her mind still racing from the weeks prior, she could only stop and blink rapidly as abruptly a dozen torches ignited in a circle around the sole pony in the room. Dawnbreak immediately bowed.\n\nAs she remained prostrate, she heard herself ordered, "Rise." She scrambled back up. Not only did the torches cast eerie glows across the walls of the cramped room, but so did Daybreaker's mane. Like the torches, her mane had exploded in brilliance, unfurling like a tongue of fire. Whatever magic Daybreaker used to control it, it could effectively be doused if need be.\n\n"W-What did you need me for, D—Empress?" Dawnbreak inquired, her heart pumping rapidly.\n\nDaybreaker smiled. Within seconds, Dawnbreak's fear which had gripped her evaporated. It was a warm grin, not threatening nor derisive. Dawnbreak took a tentative step forward.\n\n"I've called you for something I wished to do much earlier, Dawnbreak," stated Daybreaker nonchalantly. After a small burst of magic, she held up for inspection a small brand, which was already radiating heat from its orange-hot surface. Dawnbreak merely gulped at the sight.\n\n"Tell me, Dawnbreak, do you truly wish to follow me?"\n\n"Absolutely. I-I want to make sure that Harmony is safe."\n\n"Ah, but you hesitated." Clicking her tongue, Daybreaker motioned for Dawnbreak to come closer, which she obeyed. When Dawnbreak was within a hoof's length's distance, Daybreaker added, "You are not still lost, are you?"\n\n"'Lost?'" Dawnbreak tilted her head, scrutinizing Daybreaker momentarily. Arching a brow, she nickered and declared, "You forgave me. You brought me back here. I don't see what—"\n\n"Dawnbreak Shimmer, do you understand what is being asked of you? You may be reviled by the ignorant, called a monster by the outsider, and give up any hope of friends by following me." She brandished the prod. "Especially if you follow me once more."\n\nSteeling herself, Dawnbreak stared directly into Daybreaker's eyes and growled, "I'm not losing you again, Empress. I won't let my pride blind me to my purpose." She puffed out her chest. "I'm ready for anything."\n\nFor a second, Daybreaker merely observed Dawnbreak, then she flashed her teeth momentarily. Casting a bolt of fire onto the prod, she simply stated, "Good. Then, my prodigal daughter, you have a new mission: lead my ponies into obedience. Teach them their follies, provide them their one chance of salvation." At that, she jabbed Dawnbreak before the unicorn could react in the right forearm. There was a sizzling of flesh, and Dawnbreak flinched and hissed. After a brief pause, Daybreaker removed the brand, and Sunset inspected the new mark on her shoulder. A sun.\n\n"The Solaris Adoratio, and all the clergy, are yours to command, Dawnbreak.""

  solarreworked.302.d:0 ""Why did you summon me, Empress?" Sunrise Sparkle galloped into the throne room, panting. As she skidded and staggered to a halt, she glanced around as her brain registered the total absence of anypony else there. She scrunched her muzzle. "Where are the guards? Is everything all right?"\n\n"Nothing could be better, Sunrise," Daybreaker replied, inspecting one of her forehooves momentarily before getting up. Sauntering down to the stammering and stuttering Sunrise, she stopped in front of her former student and grinned. "I merely wished to speak to you." She motioned with her head for Sunrise to fall in beside her as she walked past.\n\n"'Speak with me?' Did I do something wrong? Have my reports not been satisfactory? Have I not been convicting enough traitors recently? Was there—" Sunrise cut herself off as Daybreaker whipped up a hoof to silence her. She whimpered and flattened her ears against her head.\n\nWith a chiding sigh, Daybreaker glanced over at Sunrise, the sunlight pouring through the windows of the throne room casting an almost halo effect on her. Sunrise ceased fidgeting. She swallowed, sweat beginning to form on the back of her neck. Daybreaker visually inspected her. Finally, she said with a small titter, "You've done nothing wrong. In fact, you're exceeding my expectations."\n\n"Then why—"\n\nBriefly, a flash of fury washed across Daybreaker's face, and her mane exploded in a burst of violent, white heat. "Can I not speak with my favorite student?!" Sunrise cringed back. Daybreaker exhaled again. " Sunrise, your latest numbers have been nothing short of impressive. Fifty ponies in a day? Three hundred arrests in a week? All this while you are studying a new changeling repellent spell? I was correct to enlighten you of your erroneous path."\n\nAs her face turned a beet red, Sunrise scratched her chin and muttered, "I'm only serving Harmony, and helping you."\n\nSmiling, Daybreaker cupped a hoof underneath Sunrise's check and gently pulled the young alicorn up to look at her. With a soft, comforting whinny, Daybreaker stated, "And that is what you will continue to do. You've already proven you have an eye for details on ponies' alibis and that you're able to spot rebels without issue. Therefore, you have an important task."\n\nSunrise stiffened. "Name it, Empress."\n\nTittering, Daybreaker proclaimed, "Go forth, my lady inquisitor! You will lead the Solaris Inquisitionis, the Imperial Inquisition, in cleansing my lands. Let the fire of Harmony burn any lies and dross from those whom you take."\n\nFor a second, Sunrise pressed her tongue against her cheek, then she inquired, "Does that mean I get live test subjects for my research?""

  solarreworked.303.d:0 ""Everypony on your knees, now!"\n\nThe order rung out as the doors to the small office building flung open and half-a-dozen ponies, all dressed in similar robes, marched inside. Within seconds, screams and shouts filled the air as the single security guard of the office rushed up to the ponies and the one in the lead, a white-furred mare, grabbed him in her magic and slammed him into the ground. He coughed but didn't move.\n\nGlowering, the mare bellowed, "By order of the God-Empress, Daybreaker Sun, this office is condemned for heresy!" Another one of the robed ponies slapped a large symbol on the wall, a sun in front of a sword, with a short phrase in old Ponish about the faithfulness of Daybreaker.\n\n"Sister Shinespark, I don't believe they're stopping," a stallion from the group muttered to the lead mare. With a sigh, Aurora Shinespark shook her head and lit her horn. It wasn't like there was any escape. The Inquisition had already scoped the building beforehoof.\n\n"Enough!" she boomed, using her magic to lob a ball of fire onto one of the desks in the middle of the office. Instantly, all the frightened workers huddled where they stood, and Aurora flicked her head toward them. Magic encased them all, and the workers were dragged toward the assembled inquisitors. She met the gaze of a slightly sharper dressed stallion, the manager.\n\nWhen they were released, the stallion demanded, his voice holding back a quiver, "What's the meaning of this?! Who are you—"\n\n"We are the God-Empress's Holy Inquisition," Aurora began as she narrowed her eyes. "And we trust that you won't impede our investigation more than you already have, will you, citizen..."\n\n"Rust."\n\n"Typical," Aurora sniffed. Rolling her eyes, she added with a small, derisive tone to her voice, "Well, citizen Rust, we already know that you clearly have not bothered to inform the Inquisition of heresy happening directly within your domain!" At that, Rust's face went paler, and he stammered briefly. Aurora interrupted when he continued blubbering, "Recognize this?"\n\nRevealing a small journal, Aurora flipped through a couple of pages to read them off. As she did, he merely fixed his gaze on the purple cover with a horseshoe on it. When she finished, Aurora clicked her tongue. "Rather damning, don't you think? 'Friendship journal?' I'd say rather an anti-Order manifesto, wouldn't you agree?"\n\nRust merely whimpered.\n\n"Of course, you probably do, since you've been seen cavorting with other known heretics, haven't you?" Igniting her horn, Aurora sneered. A single bolt shot from it to engulf Rust. As he screamed and collapsed in a heap, Aurora snapped, "Keep them restrained and burn everything! This tainted land must be purified!" She glanced at the workers."

  solarreworked.304.d:0 "Carefully checking her shoulders, Tulip Bulb slowly sunk down in pew near the back of the local Solarist church. Outside, through the windows of stained glass, she could catch the warm glint of the Sun. She hastily checked the preacher again, who was going on about something with Daybreaker's sunlight being a metaphor for knowledge or the like. Mostly went in one ear and out the other, if Tulip was being frank. However, nopony seemed to notice her movement, so she quickly finished her duck and then slunk across the floor.\n\nPausing only once as somepony in the pew ahead let one of her hindlegs suddenly dangle off and nearly touch her nose, Tulip soon slipped out of the row and then slithered back, toward the doors to the sanctuary. There were still no ponies around to notice her, and her heart started to beat heavily in her chest. In the back of her mind, she visualized what she could be doing. Tending to her daisy and tulip crop, for one. What did it matter if sunlight meant knowledge if her flowers were slowly drying up without her tender love and care?\n\nShe ducked through the sanctuary doors. As she did, she leaned behind her to catch the heavy, wooden doors before they slammed shut. She breathed softly. At the last second, one of her hindlegs caught the gap and prevented the noise. She gently pulled her leg out, and the doors closed with nary a whisper.\n\nShe sighed. Spinning around, she nearly screamed when she was face-to-face with somepony without warning. Instead, she stumbled back and onto her rump. Flinching away, she flattened her ears against her head when she was asked by the other pony, a stallion in the attire of the Adoratio, "Going somewhere, sister?"\n\n"I-I-I just needed some fresh air," she fibbed. "Was getting stuffy in there."\n\nHe leaned over to inspect her cutie mark. "Really?" he hummed. Tsking a couple of times, he started to trudge in a circle around her. "Disappointing."\n\n"Yeah, I think there needs to be better ventilation or something," she added, getting to her hooves and fanning her face. Her mind raced as she tried to keep the charade going. "You should—"\n\n"Oh, I wasn't talking about that." He stopped. All his hooves landed on the ground with solid thuds. Furrowing his brow, he demanded, "Why did you lie, sister? Why do you abandon the God-Empress's truths when it's the only way to survive the week unscathed?"\n\n"I wasn't—"\n\n"But you were. Everypony knows that to leave a service before the preacher is finished is..." He clicked his tongue. "Worthy. Of correction." As Tulip gulped, he added, "I think the priestess will be curious about your reasons, don't you?""

A headache was quickly forming, that much was certain. Having to listen to the lies and the filth of the heretics in the border cities of the Empire always became draining after a while. Like the one before her, on his knees, babbling about mercy, forgiveness, or the like.\n\nWith a single snort, she quipped, "That'll be sorted out by the God-Empress." Her eyes glittering briefly with malice, she added, "I'm just hastening the process." At that, she pulled the trigger to her pistol, and the heretic fell back, dead.\n\nShe sighed. Maybe now with that little issue of the heretic trying to buy bread on a Saturday, she could get back to her patrol and—\n\n"Inquisitor!"\n\nQuasar withheld a tired, exasperated exhale at the hail. It wasn't like she was on duty, as tasked by the Lady Inquisitor—as were all inquisitors in the city—to keep an active watch for dangers in and out. Investigate. Discover rot. Not be brought petty issues that could be solved with a simple execution.\n\nHowever, that was TECHNICALLY one of her other roles, and she turned as a couple of soldiers approached and expectantly tapped a hoof. "Yes, trooper?" she demanded testily. She flicked her gaze between the soldiers and the pony they were dragging between them. "Could this not be handled by your commanding officer?"\n\n"We did, Inquisitor but... he said to find one of you." Sheepishly scratching at his neck, the soldier that addressed nickered and afterward coughed into a hoof. "This one is—"\n\n"Oh, so you brought me to another one of your unappointed, dictatorial overseers? Did you vote for this one, eh?" Quasar fixed her attention on the nonsensical verbiage spewing out of the prisoner's mouth. This one was definitely far gone.\n\n"Stand up against the wall and make this quick, heretic. You speak lies incompatible with Order and Harmony." At that, Quasar's horn lit up. There was a time for simple acts, like a gunshot, but this was not it. A better execution was in order.\n\n"By whose authority?!" the prisoner, a mare, inquired. With a snort, she planted her hindlegs squarely, and barely budged as the soldiers took her to a nearby wall.\n\n"Daybreaker's."\n\n"Well, I didn't vote for her. Supreme power should be vested by the masses, not some silly orb in the sky that—"\n\nThe mare couldn't finish, as Quasar crushed her windpipe with a brief spurt of magic. As the mare collapsed to the ground, gagging and clutching at her throat, Quasar spun around and huffed, "Now, I have ACTUAL work to do. Return to your patrols.""

Small globs of blue fire flung from it to land on the marble floor of her throne room, creating soft sizzles as it cooled and ate into the stonework. On her lap were some half-written decrees, including a new tax law on public worship. It was, after all, the domain of the cult.\n\nStill, her mind wrestled and struggled to focus as she fought to finish the papers instead of listen to the nasally, prattling diatribe from Lush Coat. As Raven reminded her, he was on her day schedule, but if she had known the earful that she would have been getting from him, she would have cancelled the entire day's plans.\n\nShe checked with Raven, who was nearby. Raven mouthed "forty minutes."\n\nDaybreaker worked her jaw. Checking her unfinished papers again, she interjected, her mane continuing to whip and lash out rapidly, "Lush Coat, is there a reason for you wasting my time? Thus far, you've only moaned regarding MY choices to guide MY empire and MY ponies. Is that correct?"\n\nLush snorted. With a smug grin plastered on his perfectly maintained fur, he shook his head and declared, "Nothing of the sort, God-Empress! I am expressing concern over internal policy." He brushed a hoof on his chest. "I was on the castle's team over these matters, you will recall, I'm sure."\n\n"No, I don't." At that, Daybreaker lit her horn and narrowed her eyes. "However, I don't need upstart, arrogant imbeciles berating me on what is good for MY ponies." Leaning forward in her seat, she added, "I suggest, Lush, that you choose your battles carefully."\n\n"I always do, God-Empress. I've never fought on the field once yet!" With a soft chuckle, Lush tapped his chin then asked himself where he had drifted off. After a couple of seconds, he exclaimed, "Oh, yes! I forgot! Before... uh, you ascended, God-Empress, there was funding for lavender plants for the night watch. They have been complaining that—"\n\n"Lush. Your next words will seal your fate. Do heed my warning." Daybreaker waved him off with a hoof, her mane still bright blue and searing hot. Her interjection only brought her silence for a moment.\n\n"Forgive me, God-Empress, but I was speaking. As I was saying, I—" Before he could finish, he disappeared, the only sound left a magical popping noise, and Daybreaker sighed.\n\nGlancing over at Raven, she stated, "See to it I'm not disturbed, and that Lush Coat is made an example of.

From the center of the auditorium, it was difficult to make out much of anything coherent. Cheers and jeers mixed together, although the general tone of the crowd leaned toward dissatisfied. Throughout the theater, soldiers stood on watch, carefully scanning the throngs of ponies and marching between rows.\n\nClean Cut had watched as Daybreaker descended into her private booth a few moments before. From there, her glowing orange mane was easily noticeable against the backdrop of stone and citizens. Although he and she didn't make eye contact, he still couldn't help but shiver as he swore she had noticed him. It had only been for a second, but it was still enough.\n\nHe swallowed. Yes, there was sand on the floor, which probably contributed to his parched feeling, but he also anxiously watched as the door on the other side of the theater opened. Another pony stepped out, clad with nothing more than a sword's sheath, like him, and he looked to where Daybreaker sat. The entire amphitheater, save a few attendees, went deathly quiet.\n\nThen, suddenly, there was a loud horn and Clean was off like lightning. He whipped out his sword, which connected with his opponent's. As the two blades clanged, he exclaimed to drown out the crowd, "Sorry, Steel!" The mare across from him only frowned. After a couple of seconds of clashing, she pulled back and swiped at his hooves.\n\nHe hopped, bringing his own blade down, but she dodged and earned a couple of cheers from the crowd. In return, she poked at him, but he backed up, not before earning a slice on his chest, though.\n\nAs the gouge oozed blood, he felt it sting and then feinted. She fell for it, and as she lunged where he would have been, he came up and impacted right into her stomach with his head. She woofed as the air rushed out of her, and collapsed backward. As she slid a few feet away, he quickly bounded over to her and held his sword against her neck.\n\n"Sorry. Really am," he mumbled. "So much for being squad mates, huh?"\n\nShe sniffed and spat at him.\n\nWiping off the spit, he looked up toward Daybreaker and waited patiently. The entire theater hushed, the tension building like a balloon ready to burst. Daybreaker did nothing for a moment, then she stretched out a forehoof.

For a second, her heart had a small fire of elation, but it gave way to confusion instead. What was Chalice doing here today?\n\nShe hopped off the couch and quickly trotted to the foyer to unlatch the door. After a quick greeting with a hug, she asked, "What are you doing here? I thought you were—"\n\n"Pin, we need to talk," Chalice interjected with a solemn stare. Pincushion's ears flopped against her skull. With a wide smile, she motioned for Chalice to follow her and sat back down on her couch. Chalice paused momentarily in the hall, then followed.\n\n"What is it?" Pincushion asked, her heartbeat climbing by the second as Chalice worked her jaw a couple of times in thought. Chalice sighed and hung her head. Some of the golden highlights in her mane caught the afternoon sunlight, appearing like beams of fire in the night sky.\n\n"Your son, that's what," mumbled Chalice after a moment of thought. As soon as Pincushion heard it, her stomach churned and she gave an instinctive neigh. Chalice glanced back up and held out a hoof. "Do you know where he is right now?"\n\n"Of course not, he's old enough to play with the other foals," Pincushion retorted with a snort. Tilting her head, she demanded as her heart practically leapt into her throat, "Why? What happened to him? Is he all right?"\n\n"Oh, nothing happened to little Thistle," a second voice declared from the hallway. Whipping her head around, Pincushion's voice died in her throat when she saw an inquisitor standing with Thistle next to her. The colt was happily bouncing on the inquisitor's back. "But your answer to your neighbor is most... concerning, Pincushion." With a small huff, she stated, "Frankly, I'm afraid that you're not up to keeping the God-Empress's charge safe."\n\n"Her charge? But he's my son!"\n\nPincushion snarled when Chalice clicked her tongue. "That mindset is how we get new heretics, Pin," Chalice muttered. "I was worried when I learned you weren't watching him all the time like I did my little ones. I... I didn't want to report this."\n\n"Oh, yeah, because that makes it any better!" Hopping to her hooves, Pincushion got only a couple of inches forward toward her son before the inquisitor held her back with magic. She strained against the shield, and then teetered when her legs were bound.\n\nWith a sigh, the inquisitor stated, "I suppose he will be the village's charge now. If you are cleared of willful negligence, you may see him again. One day." At that, she passed Thistle over to Chalice, and dragged Pincushion out. Pincushion could only wail."

With a ear-splitting crash, the yard in which a number of tents and makeshift buildings had been erected shook and the closest lean-tos collapsed like dominoes. From the cloud of smoke, a single, blood red glow of magic could be seen as Daybreaker emerged from it, her mane alight with blue fire and her horn sparking with magical energy.\n\nOutside the yard, which was in a fairly remote location miles away from Tall Tale, gunshots and explosions carried into the clearing. Of the ponies that had not scrambled to flee the moment the beams of fire began, more collapsed in fear as they laid eyes upon the alicorn. She bared her teeth.\n\nA couple of armed soldiers near her, who were now covered in dust and dirt, glanced between each other and then opened fire. Daybreaker cackled. Abruptly, the bullets halted as they hit a thin, crimson shield. Both soldiers took some steps back.\n\nFrankly, to call them troopers would have been an insult, Daybreaker mused to herself as she lunged toward them and cracked their heads together. There was a sickening crunch from both skulls and the ponies tumbled to the ground, limp and lifeless. These were barely a danger, although the word of rebels near Tall Tale had sent worry through the populace around it, and putting these clearly deficient ponies out of their misery was enough of an excuse to get out.\n\nShe pondered to herself as she spotted some more rebels and grabbed both in her magic and twisted their necks without even straining. Honestly, she should have been thanking them, in a way. It was getting dull around the palace, what with endless audiences with aristocrats and appearing at cult ceremonies.\n\nShe teleported to a group nearby. As she rematerialized in their midst and unleashed a blast of fire, she thought how if it weren't for these idiotic foals, she wouldn't have been able to test her training. After all, she hadn't been sitting idly on her flank. Keeping the Empire united required more than just looks and brains.\n\nAs she glanced back at a pony screaming and firing wildly, she casually flung a bolt of flame at the soldier and returned to her contemplation. While she drove a hoof through a crawling trooper's spine, she nodded her head in thought. She'd definitely need to get out more and do something like this. Get the blood pumping.\n\nAfter her latest victim stopped writhing, she looked up and blinked. The entire yard was ablaze, and the stench of burned flesh filled her nostrils. She hummed.

Not rooting out heresy or discovering a plot against her goddess, but house calls and arguments with stubborn parents. Like the one that she was sitting across the table from at the moment.\n\nThe mare across from her shook. Whether from fear or anger, Notes couldn't quite tell, and if she were to be asked, she didn't particularly care. She briefly twitched her gaze around the living room that she had practically had to demand she be allowed into, and mentally jotted down what it was like. Through the scattered pictures across the room of her host, she could tell that the family was tight knit. Perfect for what the God-Empress required.\n\nTaking a sip of tea which she had made for herself, the mare growled and gritted her teeth, showing enough of the musculature of her neck to leave the impression of hidden physical strength to Notes. Not that it would do the mare much good if it came to blows. Magic was a great deterrent, after all.\n\nAfter downing the rest of her drink entirely, the mare flared her nostrils and swished her tail angrily. "I am being unreasonable for wanting to raise MY filly?" She scoffed. "She spent eleven months in my womb. I birthed her. Now Daybreaker wants to—"\n\n"Speak with reverence, citizen," Notes snapped back, which made the mare flinch in surprise. She steepled her hooves together. Looking at the mother over them, she added, "The God-Empress has asked this of many others, too. The cult requires strength, power, and your daughter fits perfectly."\n\n"And she will be raised by strangers!" Shaking her head, the mare glowered at Notes. Inwardly, Notes let out a tired sigh and started counting to ten. She tapped it out on the couch, too, although the mare didn't appear to pick up on the unsubtle warning. Instead, she bared her teeth and exclaimed, "Why must she be used? Let her make her own choices!"\n\n"And that is how heresy takes root," mumbled Notes before she got up. Before the mare could react, Notes bound her forelegs together with magic, and Notes declared, "Honeysuckle, you have impeded the God-Empress's will, and will face the consequences when she can determine your fate."\n\nAs Honeysuckle's face went pale, Notes leaned in and hissed, "If you're lucky, she'll get to visit you in a few years and remember you.

Shouts and cries carried throughout the hallways of the building, with the occasional scream for mercy discernible among the noise.\n\nHowever, Quasar barely paid any attention to it, rather, she zeroed her attention onto the aristocrats that were there, interrupted in their apparently riveting discussion on macroeconomics. She shut the door behind her, which made the aristocrat that had been giving the presentation raise his eyebrow. He stepped forward. "Is there something the matter, Inquisitor?"\n\nQuasar licked her lips. While she had heard of other encounters in years past that had gone on in the palace, but it was the first time she had been part of this great honor. When the upper crust pony, clearly annoyed given his furrowed brow and slight snarl, repeated his question, Quasar merely smiled and replied, "Oh, there is a small issue." She glanced at everypony there. "With ALL of you."\n\nAs she magicked in a piece of paper, she flapped it a couple of times and listened to it crackle and ripple. Dangling it in front of the aristocrat's face for a second or two, she stated, "You've all been so very disappointing, but I'm not surprised, frankly." She brought it back and paced the room, although she locked the door, now that it was shut, with a soft click.\n\nAll the doors had hidden locks, if ponies knew how to use the right spell for it.\n\nAlthough it was quiet, the latch must have been caught, as the pony across from her went slightly more pallid. He glanced back out the window on the exterior wall. He coughed. "What do you mean, Inquisitor? We've labored for the God-Empress. We've accomplished much."\n\n"But not enough," Quasar emphasized with another beat of the paper. Clucking like a disappointed mother, Quasar snarked with a chiding tone, "If you had only taken one less day off, you'd have ben productive enough to avoid this." At the aristocrat's ears wilting, Quasar chuckled. She powered her horn. It sparked fiercely, sending sparks and wisps of smoke into the air.\n\n"There's no room in the Empire for slackers." She tilted her head as the stallion stammered profusely. "Perhaps you thought that, maybe, you would be allowed a reprieve? Spend time studying outside of Daybreaker's approved list?" She hummed. "Such a shame you'll never continue."\n\n"Wait—" the stallion began before he, as well as the rest of the aristocrats there, were taken in a magic field.

Alone, he stood with only a couple of the God-Empress's personal guards on either side of the entryway from where she would no doubt come at any moment.\n\nIn his mind, he replayed possible ways he could thank her for what she promised to do. How, though, could he express any gratitude that could come close to honoring her? When she raised the Sun itself, how could only a few words express reverence?\n\nHe ran a hoof through his mane and winced at the still tender feeling that rushed through his horn when he even got close. While that bullet didn't completely destroy the horn, repair and healing would take years to fully come into effect. Instead of continue to irritate it, he opted to instead start tapping both his forehooves on the floor instead, which earned some slightly distracted glances from the guards.\n\nThe marble that decorated the room, floor to ceiling, reflected him clearly, and he made sure, again, that his uniform was perfect. It was, but there was always an excuse for ensuring it was.\n\nBefore he could continue his neurosis any further, the door swung open, and his heart stopped. Daybreaker marched through, her mane bursting forth like a ball of fire, and he instantly fell to his knees. Internally, he praised the very air he breathed that he finally saw her face-to-face. His mind froze. His breath nearly ceased.\n\n"Rise," he heard her command, and he stammered. Finally, with jelly for legs, he got up and stared at her.\n\n"So, you are the one that Blueblood commended?" Daybreaker inquired, arching her brow inquisitively. She sniffed. "Tell me, do YOU believe you deserve his praise?"\n\n"God-Empress, all of it belongs to you," he stuttered, and then internally winced. Daybreaker merely nickered. "I can recount the rebels I destroyed. The heretics I brought to the Inquisitionis. All of it." He grinned. "In detail. Their screams, their last words, their—"\n\nShe held up a hoof. "Enough. Blueblood promised me a zealous guard captain. I believe he was right." Nodding to her guards, she spun on her hooves. "Report to the palace tomorrow, Captain Hoofbeat. You and your company's new post begins immediately." She stomped out, and Thundering felt his knees knock together.\n\nBefore anypony could react, he collapsed, out cold."

  solarreworked.313.d:0 "Since the Solaris Cultus was elevated to official state religion and political apparatus, it has attracted no shortage of skilled ponies who wish to eagerly serve the God-Empress. While the majority of the candidates merely have backgrounds of either religion in the previous regime—as there were a number of smaller Celestial sects, even if they were not encouraged—or another, worthwhile civilian history. Ponies from all walks of life, ranging from psychologists to doctors to mailponies have been accepted, and all have done their best to further the Cultus and also protect Harmony where they could.\n\nSince we have purified the military multiple times, there have been a number of gaps that have opened up in its structure which have yet to be filled. Current desire to remedy these holes is low among the general populace, as there have been some concerns regarding if another "purge" were to take place, if the new officer's neck would be on the line.\n\nThat doesn't mean, though, that there are no possible options.\n\nAs the Cultus accepted everypony willing to serve, that has included a number of former soldiers and officers who relinquished their rank in order to follow the God-Empress and serve Harmony in a greater purpose. Just because they have hung up their uniforms doesn't mean that they have forgotten all they learned both in academies and on the field, and as some have become inquisitors, their tactics-driven minds have become apparent.\n\nAdditionally, within the Solaris Inquistionis, which is much more militaristic than the Adoratio arm of the Cultus, ponies of aptitude have been enticed to become inquisitors and root out heresy. The cleansing of Manehattan has been thanks to Aurora Shinespark and some of her fellow inquisitors, whereas the pacification of Fillydelphia is due to Pulsar Beam's work. While not all of these may be able to lead soldiers, they should be given the option. They have already proven that they are more than capable in the field, and have outwitted countless insurgency and heretic groups.\n\nA few have already expressed interest in helping the military, and if we encourage the rest, we will have a surge of candidates who can aid us for hot wars well into the future."

What would happen if their lives were demanded of them in that moment? Would they fight it or would they embrace it? I've seen the former in too many of my own ponies, but they have been broken over time. Futility in the wake of the eternal Sun provides a far better perspective on life than before.\n\nYet my little ponies are still hesitant. Those within the Empire are secure, safe in their knowledge that they are led by a living goddess, but I am the Empress of PONYkind. What of those that live outside the Empire? The ponies overseas, on Griffonia, or the wayward souls in Zebrica?\n\nEverywhere I look, there is only disorder and chaos. Death and destruction has been brought upon so many of my innocent ponies. Their lives snuffed out like blades of grass in the wind. None know of the joy of serving me, of serving Harmony.\n\nThey refuse to give me reverence. No matter how much my diplomats have coerced, the ponies outside the Empire refuse to bow the knee. Do they not know that they spurn a deity? Do they not understand that when I look out upon my ponies, I see a million troops ready to die for Harmony's cause?\n\nI have brought my enemies to ruin. While they kicked and screamed struggling against the sun, their corruption was burned out and purified in holy fire.

  solarreworked.315.d:0 ""You think that they'll ever learn?" Golden Pyre asked as she glanced behind her at her fellow inquisitor, Bright Dawn. Frowning, she paused to glance at the hastily scrawled directions that she and Bright had uncovered, written in partial code, to a supposed meeting by some in the harmonic resistance, or, as rightly declared by the God-Empress and Lady Inquisitor, heretics.\n\n"Learn what?" Bright countered as she marched past Golden. With a huff, she stopped and rested against one of the old buildings in downtown Fillydelphia. Although the buzz of traffic, wheeled and hoof, carried up as a din in the city, the winding alleyways that they had taken were eerily quiet. Enough to make her shiver.\n\n"They continue resisting!" Crumpling the paper in her magic, Golden rolled her eyes and adjusted her inquisitor's cowl. "We keep putting them down, and they never seem to stop popping out like cockroaches!" At that, Bright arched an eyebrow. "You've been here in Filly longer than I. Is it normal to have this much chatter about them?"\n\nBright shrugged. "It varies. Come on, we're probably close. If we get a good vantage point, we can catch them in the act and arrest them." Slipping down another side alley, she disappeared and her hoofsteps started to fade into the background noise of the city. Golden merely scrunched the paper tighter.\n\nWith a tired exhale, she unfurled it and continued making her way down the streets like the directions gave. By this time, Bright had made significant headway, and she barely vanished behind another turn in the alleyways when Golden almost caught up. Golden huffed. As she rounded the bend again, she started to slow as she glanced up. They seemingly had arrived at the courtyard in one of the old slum areas, but there was no meeting they could eavesdrop on. None of the buildings were lit, even from behind blinds, no corners in which they could hide, and no—\n\nCLANK!\n\nGolden whirled around. Bright was in a corner, waltzing out from the shadows. A small pipe had been kicked aside, probably by a stray hoof. In her magic, she held small pistol, and had it aimed at Golden. "Sister Dawn, what are you doing?" Golden crouched low, ready to jump out of the way with a shield spell. "Put that away, now, or the God-Empress—"\n\n"The 'God-Empress' will do nothing!" Bright spat as she flicked the safety off the pistol. As she did, Golden leapt toward her, shield blocking any gunshot, and almost latched on, but was struck in the side by a heavy piece of metal. She grunted and slid to the ground, barely keeping conscious as she saw Bright conferring with another pony. One whom she caught give a harmonic codeword before darkness overtook her."

  solarreworked.316.d:0 ""Did Fillydelphia honestly have too few inquisitors to do their own work? There are enough problems in Manehattan that we shouldn't have been diverted." Growling and furrowing her brow, Nova Glow glowered at the ground as she trotted with two of her fellow inquisitors. They were surrounded by tall, slimy, stinking walls of the buildings that were in this slum of Fillydelphia. Occasionally a pony would pop their head out to investigate the clinking of she and her fellow inquisitors' metal shoes on the cobblestone, but catching who they were quickly made them retreat into their homes.\n\nThe mare beside her, Novus Flux, shot a withering stare before rolling her eyes. Braying as she went ahead and trotted behind the lead inquisitor, she quipped back, "Our heretics haven't kidnapped any inquisitors."\n\n"That we know of," Nova retorted.\n\nBefore Novus could counter with something else, the trio of inquisitors popped out into a courtyard for a number of the rundown apartments. At one point, it would have been rather luxurious, but the early tenth-century dwellings had been abandoned to neglect. Crumbling grout and mortar occasionally ran off one of the towers, making Nova's ears twitch toward each movement.\n\n"Sister Pyre was with Sister Dawn when they both disappeared, but the reasons why both were here are unknown." Their leader, Aurora Shinespark, surveyed the area, her golden eyes sparking with annoyance as she landed her gaze on both of her figurative sisters. Without another word, she marched toward the central, dry fountain in the courtyard. "If either Sister had their head on their shoulders, they would have tried to leave something behind to indicate a direction they were taken, or who might have taken them."\n\n"Yes, because that would be evident from a scrap," Nova snarked. Peering around, she heard another pony open a window, and she spun around and snapped, "Halt! Inquisitionis! Speak of—" She didn't finish as the stallion in the window retreated and she snarled. While a fire spell built on her horn, sending sparks everywhere, she bellowed, "Out! Or you shall be declared a heretic!"\n\nNovus nickered. Cantering to beside Nova, she inquired, "Or perhaps tact is in order?" At that, she went to knock on the door of the apartment. She inhaled a couple of times, shifting on her hooves, and rapped on it. "We only have questions on if you saw anything. Sister Glow is not going to declare you a heretic."\n\n"I was."\n\nGrimacing, Novus glanced back to quip at Nova, but Aurora held up a hoof as she got close to a small blood stain on the ground. Beside it, a tiny scrap of clothing. She leaned down and the other two inquisitors moved closer. "You shan't need an interrogation." Holding up the scrap, its golden threads caught in the weak sunlight coming through the gaps in the apartment buildings. An inquisitor's robe."

  solarreworked.317.d:0 "She'd been speared. That had to be the reason her head was shrieking at her.\n\nBlinking away some of the pain, Golden Pyre slowly opened her eyes to take in her surroundings. However, all that she could see was that she was in chains, and she could feel a cool ring around her horn. From the dimness in the building, and the scent of hay, she was probably in some barn far outside of Fillydelphia. For all she knew, she could have been halfway across the Empire. For however long she was out, it was entirely possible.\n\nSlowly, her brain began to wake up, and her chest clenched tight, like a vice had gripped her heart. As if a fire was building in her stomach, she coughed and snarled instinctively as the last memory she had resurfaced. Like she had been summoned by Golden's memory, Bright Dawn sauntered through a door, the blinding light outside making Golden wince and close her eyes. When the door had slammed shut, she used her horn to create a faint light.\n\nAs she slipped up to Golden, Bright smiled, "Sorry for the surprise, but it's not like I could ASK you to come out here and see the truth."\n\n"The only truth I see is that my Sister betrayed me!" Hocking a small glob of spit, Golden managed to score a hit on the side of Bright's cheek. Bright exasperatedly brought up a hoof to wipe it off.\n\nClicking her tongue, Bright huffed, "Well, it's not like I asked for that either, but then my friends in the Fillydelphian resistance found me, convinced me, and, now it's time for  your turn, too." She pulled out a book with a horseshoe on it. Flipping it open and perusing its pages, she slammed it down and opened her mouth. Before she could start, though, there was the sound of a few gunshots outside, and she whipped her head around.\n\nShe powered her horn, but staggered back when there was screech from the guards outside, and one went sailing through the door, on fire. Some of the debris struck both inquisitors. When her head cleared, Golden's heart leapt when she saw silhouetted an alicorn, which resolved into the Lady Inquisitor herself. Bright also recognized Sunrise Sparkle, and her face paled.\n\nSunrise Sparkle scanned the room. "You know, for wanting a secret hiding place, this isn't very secret." She scoffed, blocking a single blast of magic with a shield counter. Practically sashaying into the barn, which was beginning to fill with smoke, she matched Bright's gaze, and added, "Or, maybe, it's because you got sloppy." In her magic, she floated up a small patch of Bright's inquisitor robe, and Golden smirked. Her nip at the fabric managed to accomplish something before blacking out.\n\nStill in shock, Bright stammered and Sunrise shook her head. "You should know the God-Empress doesn't take betrayal lightly." Perking up slightly, Sunrise added, "But, it's great news! I have a whooooole list of procedures for punishing former inquisitors. You'll get to trial them!" She teleported in a quill, and then asked, "Do you mind filling out a survey at its effectiveness after we're done?""

Don't worry your precious heads any more about why the sun is acting so strangely, or your Empress has sent so many of you to the front lines.\n\nIn short, because it serves me, but I suppose you should know more.\n\nWhen our enemies were at our gates, knocking at them and threatening to batter them down, who could you turn to? Could you turn to the Elements of Harmony and hope a giant rainbow beam from the sky could wash it all away? No. Could you turn to Luna to save you through military might? Absolutely not. Could you trust in anypony other than the one pony who has guide you for a millennium, one who knows what is best for every last one of you?\n\nOf course you could.\n\nAnd that's where I come in. We had grown fat and complacent, my little ponies, and none of us saw it until it was too late. Harmony, as we believed it was, had failed us. Somepony had to make the toughest choices, and that fell to me. It was I who kept the darkness at bay, who shielded us all from the greatest threats to arise against us all in generations!\n\nIf there was no sunset on Harmony, though, then there'd be no glorious sunrise of Order. Since I've taken the reins, what has happened to us? We've survived. At great cost, but survival nonetheless.\n\nHow many have we lost to foalishness after I ascended? Some of you may still call me a tyrant, but you fail to see the bigger picture. I am Harmony itself! I have made decisions in Harmony's name for a thousand years! Only I know the true way forward, and yet some of you complain that I am making a mistake?!\n\nDo you not see how my Empire has already improved on the old? I shall bring you all into perfect harmony, if you will only listen and follow. This will take blood and sweat, and many of you may perish, but take solace that I will be with you every step of the way, as long as you obey me."

It was a deep red, and she held a grin on her muzzle.\n\nGreenback briefly cast his attention to Daybreaker, then back to High Interest. With barely any movement, he shifted enough so that he could his back, "You do realize that she's now—" he grimaced "—majority stakeholder, yes?"\n\nInterest sniffed in derision. "Can you NOT mention that? I've already had to have my stylist use mane extensions. Pulled half of it out fussing about the Empress's... curiosity about us." Steepling her hooves together, she stared at Daybreaker when the alicorn rested a stern gaze on her. It was only for a moment, as Interest eventually jerked her head away to bark some meaningless order at one of the staff members delivering refreshments.\n\nShe cleared her throat, taking a sip of the water that had been placed before her. Daybreaker continued to watch her with interest. Licking her lips, Interest got up and dropped the first slide into place. "Well, since everypony that would show up has, I suppose it's, uh, time to get started." She nickered as she glanced at Daybreaker again. "I must acknowledge that we are blessed to be in the presence of our Empress," she added.\n\nWithout waiting, she went into the first slide. Simple things, like the current dividends of the company how much will be paid out each quarter. As she continued to rattle on, eventually Daybreaker stood up, and everypony looked to her. Even Interest stuttered as her mind paused.\n\nDaybreaker declared as she rolled her shoulders, "While that's all very fascinating... Interest, was it?" At Interest's nod, Daybreaker continued, "Yes, intriguing, but, I feel that I must request that Star Energy do things, oh, slightly differently." At that, Interest's blood froze.\n\n"You can't just come in here and—"\n\n"Oh, but I can," interjected Daybreaker with a small chuckle. Sauntering up to Interest, she stated, "Empress and primary stakeholder." She tapped Interest on the nose. "Now," she began, swiveling around and stalking around the board room. "These current power percentages. I'd suggest that, oh, the first ninety percent only go to the military, and then you can divvy the rest up as you see fit."\n\n"But they pay less!

However, before he did, the weight at the other end finally lessened, and he sighed when she saw the great pillar come to an upright position.\n\nOh, they certainly could have been provided proper equipment to erect that one and the other three that were to be arranged around the central structure of this towering monument, but it was "suggested" that they give more ponies jobs by using them for physical labor, rather than use such basic things as cranes.\n\nHe wiped at his forehead. Sunlight poured through the taller buildings of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], although he felt exposed given how much of it reached him. In the back of his mind's eye, he could still envision the streets and houses that had resided here only a few months prior.\n\nShaking his head, he stared up at the final result of their work. While the other pillars still needed to be raised, he could at least admire the massive—truly—statue of Daybreaker. The edifice's face was held high, and she was crushing a changeling under her hoof. Appropriately patriotic, as he had called it.\n\nGranted, that didn't brink back houses, but...\n\nAs his mind began to trail off again, he heard some of his other workers gasp and bow, and he turned to see Daybreaker herself, trailed by guards, approaching the monument.

She cackled. "Nopony can question the might of me, and Harmony, with this! Everypony who sees it will be awed and know me as their mistress!" Chuckling again, she turned her attention back to him. "You've done most excellently. Rest easy tonight knowing that you've earned the appreciation of your Empress."\n\nSharing some looks between his workers and then going back to Daybreaker, he carefully cleared his throat before she turned to leave and asked, "One thing, Empress?"\n\nShe snorted.

All of them liars.\n\nOh, perhaps they believe they desire conflict to end and for nations to respect other nations, but how do they go about doing it? When changelings desire to feed upon their victims, do they politely ask or do they crush, conquer, and kill those that resist? Would not their tyrannical queens pronounce that they are only wanting peace to prevail so that their subjects can live safely?\n\nYet, what do they do? They murder those that fight against them.\n\nWhen the deer of Olenia raided, pillaged, and scorched my ponies' towns, carrying off captives as slaves, they believed they were bringing peace to their own. However, they still left settlements across western portions of the Empire drenched in blood so many centuries ago.\n\nOr what of the griffons? Their whole society is based upon conflict, yet they hold that they only want peace, since the kaisers once held swathes of land across the entire continent. But when Grover II nearly demolished the River Ponies, where were their friendly, pacifist tendencies that they supposedly flaunt so well?\n\nNo, none of them truly desire to be at peace, no matter what those that lead them say. Better that they speak the truth: they wish to see me, to see Order fall. Why else have so many targeted my ponies and myself for decades?\n\nWould the changelings happily agree to peace and just talk out differences? Do the yaks think that they can hide behind their isolation, where they have eagerly spilled their own blood over some petty squabble? What of the yeti left behind by the Storm King?\n\nAll of them believe they will have peace, and that others will respect that when their spats are over. Isn't it amusing how they yearn for being left alone, but won't for anycreature else?\n\nWhy should I hide any of my ambitions, then? If the two-faced leaders of the world strive toward "peace" as they wish it, then why should I claim the same? Oh, one day conflict will fade.

Aside from a few splotches of paint and a half-finished sculpture that had yet to be fully paid for, the arts and crafts aisles of his store were morosely empty. As he continued to stare at the blank wall opposite him, over the low shelves of supplies for prospective creatives, he imagined the concrete pained with something more appealing.\n\nA burning changeling hive would be a nice start.\n\nWith a sigh, he went back to his sculpture and flicked his ears when the bell of his front door dinged. A couple of sets of hoofsteps clip-clopped inside, and he felt the wave of warmth follow the customer inside. He wiped his brow. To say that Baltimare was sweltering at the moment was a minor understatement.\n\nMinor.\n\nAfter quickly wiping off his hooves onto his apron, he inquired as he looked back to the store floor, "Is there anything I can help you with?"\n\nA petite, white unicorn mare hummed. For a couple of seconds, her right ear flapped in thought. A smirk formed on her muzzle as she sauntered toward him. Resting both her hooves on the counter, she inquired, "Perhaps. Have you seen any suspicious activity here lately?" He gazed into her golden eyes. Faintly, a drop of sweat trickled down his neck.\n\nHe scratched there. "Uh, I'm afraid I don't know what would be seen as 'suspicious'." Gesturing to his partly-finished sculpture, he declared, "I'm a rather busy stallion." Shaking his head, he asked, "Sorry, is this part of a police investigation?"\n\nThe mare narrowed her eyes. After stepping back, she went trotted around the shop, stopping near the back of it. Close to the storage room. He gulped. Although nothing truly damning was there, keeping a few paintings of Celestia for references in art was... well, he wasn't sure. Possibly not approved.\n\nKicking the door in to the storage room, the mare quipped, "Imperial Investigative Service. Aurora Shinespark." Her horn glowed brightly. Out of the corner of his eye, Bright spotted the door shine with the same color. "I have credible reports that there have been... suspect activities here and—ah ha!"

After all, it was frigid, despite how much of the central Empire was apparently in permanent summer. Not so on the northern frontier. They didn't even have enough clout to appear on the maps.\n\nOne of the ponies, an older unicorn mare, rolled her eyes and stated, "As explained, Mayor Snowday, you are being relieved.

A wry grin spreading on her face, she pushed back from the rough desk that she had in her office, and gestured out to the window.

What were once shining marble pillars, laced with gold were now scorched from other fires that had been raised and later put out.\n\nShe took a step forward.\n\nIt was her duty. She was the Empress's Lady Inquisitor. She was an exemplar.\n\nBut she couldn't.\n\nAs guilt built in her throat, choking out any air and leaving her gasping for relief, she simply continued staring at the old book that she had read years ago. She caught a mare rush past her, with more copies of it, and for the briefest of seconds winced at them going up in flames, removing yet more history of the Empress's relations.\n\nDaybreaker was the only one worthy of loyalty, but what would ponies do if they found out, years later, that there was another alicorn that had once controlled the skies? Of course, the Empress controlled everything. All the Empire was for her, and only her, but still...\n\nSunrise strode out again. Now the heat of the flames bit back against her, which made her mane dry and some of the ends split. Her eyes smarted. Tears flowed down her muzzle, but even she was unsure if it was the heaviness in her heart or only the scorching temperatures assaulting her.\n\nAs her questions continued to fester, she closed her eyes and envisioned Daybreaker. She would be furious if not obeyed. Sunrise had been entrusted. How could she not do a simple task?\n\nMore visions of her retraining, her teaching, her instruction, filled Sunrise's head. Whimpering as she recalled how the Empress had expressed pride in her only days prior, Sunrise wiped her eyes, then she frowned. The Empress was trusting her. She wouldn't fail. What did old stories have for her, anyway?\n\nShe winced as she tossed the book into the fire. As the pages popped and crackled, they were like gunshots to her soul. But still, some of the guilt faded instantly, and she smiled.\n\nShe loved the Empire.\n\nShe loved the Empress."
  solarreworked.326.d_b:0 "Thunderous chants and beating of hooves reverberated through the main library of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and Daybreaker breathed in the soot. After the acrid stench of smoke, wafting up from the towering pile of books that burned in front of her, filled her nose, she bore her fangs in a toothy smile and watched as her ponies trotted to and fro from the various halls of the building.\n\nMarble and gold that once ordained the walls and pillars of the old structure had been coated in ash from the books that had already been incinerated. Puffy, thick clouds of smoke hung heavily in the air, choking out most of the light that was filtering in through the skylight, which made the darkness of the night even more overwhelming.\n\nAs dancing shadows flickered and jumped along the walls, fed by the ever hurried crowds of ponies that had been stirred up, she cleared her throat. One of her aides nodded and called for all there to cease their wanderings, and Daybreaker grinned as she flapped once from the second floor balcony she was using and landed with a thud in the midst of some of her citizens.\n\nImmediately, all of them bowed in deference to her, and she gently placed a hoof on one who appeared the most fearful. She sensed his terror. Catching the book that he held in his magic, she snatched it without asking and flipped through it. It was a familiar tale. Two sisters, one ruling the day, the other the night. Nopony paid attention to the younger's night and was banished for her desire to usurp the day.\n\nDaybreaker scoffed.\n\nHolding up the brown book, which was ornately decorated with a golden horse head, she proclaimed, "Ponies, my loyal servants, hear me now!" She displayed the tome. "See what lies you once believed! This book alone is nothing more than a myth, a fairy tale, to deceive you into thinking that I would have any equal!"\n\nWith a snarl, she noted those who didn't gasp audibly at her declaration. They would be dealt with later.\n\n"Tonight, you are liberating yourselves from the shackles of faulty memories, of wrong history!" Spinning around, she hurled the book into the fire, and smirked as its pages burned and crackled. She faced the crowd again with a cackle, and she boomed, "You shall fill this library with my own tales! Your foals and their foals and their foals' foals will never be confused, never be misled by the lies from before. They will only know me! I will guide them to a bright, prosperous future! SOL INVICTUS!"\n\nAs a cheer went up from the crowd, Daybreaker closed her eyes basked in the adoration."

  solarreworked.327.d:0 "Exhaling a long trail of fire from her muzzle, Daybreaker frowned when the ripples of heat bounced back toward her from the now rapidly decaying forest in front of her. Towering pillars of orange, belching smoke and screaming through the consistent crackle and pop of burning wood, stretched their way skyward as if yearning for some angelic being to rescue them.\n\nDaybreaker flung up a shield spell as she caught the faintest crack of bullets in the distance. Within seconds, many ricocheted and impacted her spell, spreading cracks like spiderwebs across the blood-red surface. Her armor glistened in the early morning sunlight, and she glanced back at the dozen soldiers following her.\n\nA couple shifted nervously on their hooves. One ducked to the ground to narrowly avoid another spray of gunshots. As the fire crackled around her and the enemy rounds zoomed past her, Daybreaker cried, "Well?! What are you standing there for?! Charge them!"\n\nWithout waiting for a response, she powered her horn, parting the flames of the forest into two great walls, and she dove through. While she couldn't know if any of her soldiers would follow, she careened ahead. Soon enough, a small, fortified position built upon a hill on the other side of the woods appeared. Ponies scrambled around it, laying into her position with more machine gun fire. Her shield blocked most of it while the rest that broke through pinged off her armor plates.\n\nIt was only an exercise, she had been told. It was she who wanted the live rounds.\n\nShe smirked.\n\nAlthough the fort was well-secured, it would not save them. Especially, she determined after spotting all but one soldier arrive near her at the base of the walls, when there were warm bodies to command.\n\nDaybreaker glanced back and saw the missing troop lying in the field, crimson staining the grass around her. Daybreaker merely scoffed. Focusing on the soldiers she had, she ordered, "Take this for me! Anypony who secures the command center will get a monument in their memory!" Expecting somepony to take her up, she snarled when they all hesitated.\n\n"Now!" she snapped, hurling one unprepared stallion over the wall. She teleported herself.\n\n"Enemy" soldiers darted in all directions, and she could hear the cocking of weapons as they aimed at her. She could sense their fear. With a sneer, she cackled, "I'd put those down. Your Empress commands it."\n\nA couple obeyed, but she sniffed as the rest didn't. They followed their original orders well. However, she snatched one in her magic and quickly turned the field into living fire. As the mare writhed, Daybreaker tossed her aside, and charged. Today was going to be a fun practice session."

  solarreworked.328.d:0 "Perspiration trailed down Nebula Flare's face as her entire skull felt like it was going to explode at any second. Despite the windows permitting the resplendent sunlight of Daybreaker into small training quarters of the local garrison in Manehattan, the room glowed more with her own horn's magic than with the natural light, and she grunted as she strained to control the flow into the field.\n\nWith a groan, she closed her eyes and heard the sparking and sputtering of a well of energy tapped almost dry, and then she released it. Angling her horn to be perpendicular with the floor, she screamed as the blazing orange beam of pure magic fired across the room and engulfed a single figure inside it. Wards glowed upon the wall where her spell impacted, absorbing the entire thing like it was little more than a droplet in a bucket.\n\nTiredly, she wiped at her forehead as she heard another mare state, "Continue! You're almost beset by a full company of soldiers if you do not fight and flee!"\n\nRegardless of her physical exhaustion, Nebula obeyed and spun to the right, pulsing out a series of blasts from her horn into a target dummy a short distance away. She twirled and created a solid line of orange from the tip of her horn and sliced cleanly through another.\n\nAfterward, she paused and panted, looking over her hoofwork. The first figure she hit, once a target, now nothing but a pile of ash, made her smirk. The other two were still at least partly intact.\n\nIf they were ponies, they'd be all dead.\n\n"Enough! Your studies are going well. You must tap into all your energy to vaporize all three, however." An older mare trotted from the back of the room. Arching a brow, she added, "At least you no longer hesitate. The Empress's teachings are imprinting well, then."\n\n"Yes, you were right to point to her," Nebula stated with a nod to her instructor. At that, she sighed and fell onto her haunches, gasping for air and hastily conjuring a glass of water. After guzzling it, she mumbled, "How does she do it all day?"\n\nNebula's instructor grinned at her. Stepping forward, she stated with a small scoff, "She's had thousands of years of study and practice. You'll have five. Now get up, do it again."\n\nNebula groaned. Her horn was going to shatter, she knew it."

The sun practically moved like the hand of a clock, inching in what she perceived as a jerking manner every minute or so, nearer and nearer to the horizon.\n\nWith a soft clearing of her throat, she started to tap a hoof on the ground before she froze. As the doors to the room she waited in opened, Daybreaker casually strolled in, her mane roiling and brightly lighting up the space around her. Her eyes glowed. Wicked sneer on her face, she gestured silently to the game board before her; a chessboard, specifically.\n\nCrimson Line swallowed. Bowing, she briefly met Daybreaker's gaze with awe and fear, and then hastily sat down at the black side of the chessboard. Daybreaker straddled the seat across from her.\n\n"You wish to impress me, Lieutenant Line?" Daybreaker inquired almost disinterestedly. She summoned the pieces, and made her first move. Crimson Line's brain went into overdrive. As she calculated all the potential moves, Daybreaker merely sneered. "Well, impress me. You claim you can meet my demands for the general staff. Prove it."\n\nAt that, she matched Crimson's placement of a knight, and then stated, "Let the game begin."\n\nSweat poured down Crimson's face as the match started to drag on. Although Daybreaker had lost a number of pieces, she was clearly toying with Crimson. She still had a rook, two bishops, a queen, and of a couple of pawns. Crimson had the same plus a knight and minus a bishop.\n\nDaybreaker's face was unreadable, other than confidence. There was no deserved smug superiority. Only focus. Intense focus.\n\nHesitating for a second, Crimson started to map out the few ways she had left in victory, and then she had an idea. There was a pawn near one of Daybreaker's which was near the opposing king. If she could line it up right...\n\nShe moved. "Knight takes pawn," she muttered, leaving it right next to Daybreaker's king. It was in no danger, and Daybreaker smirked.\n\n"King takes knight," she quipped.\n\nCrimson gulped. She managed to check the king, and then lined up one, final sacrifice. The king was near the bishop, and she stated, "Queen takes bishop. Check."\n\nWith a huff, Daybreaker rolled her eyes and took the queen with the king, since it was adjacent. Crimson smirked. "Check," she stated, moved her pawn up. Daybreaker tittered, took the pawn, then halted mid-laugh. Her mistake was apparent in hindsight.\n\nShe'd been backed into a corner, and the pawn, bishop, and rook covered all outs. The queen had been the required sacrifice. With a grin, Crimson leaned back in her chair and declared, "Checkmate."\n\nFor a second, Daybreaker's mane flickered brighter, then she snickered. "I think you've just proven your worth," she quipped and got up. "Congratulations, General Line.""

Something about fireballs or the like. Rather boring, if she had to speak up. It seemed like nothing was really geared for when she was finally out of the hellhole that was school.\n\nWasn't she supposed to learn how live life? What did offensive magic have to do with anything.\n\n"Beam Glow, do you not find recreating the Empress's flame fascinating?" she caught her instructor, Daisy Pyre, inquire with a hint of irritation. Instantly, Beam Glow ceased fiddling with her quill and shook her head rapidly. She could already imagine the rant incoming.\n\nClicking her tongue, Daisy Pyre paused and then sat behind her desk. The other students all averted their gaze, so that Daisy could solely focus on Beam. She steepled her hooves together. "Beam, Beam, Beam, haven't you figured it out yet?"\n\n"What's there to figure out? Just more ways to set things on fire." Beam cringed and cursed herself. Still, she was already digging her grave, so she might as well jump hoof-first into it. "Shouldn't we be learning, I don't know, math or something? Isn't that what most creatures do?"\n\nAs a few amused chuckles escaped her classmates, she felt a small surge of adrenaline course through her. Daisy simply watched her, then sighed like a disappointed parent. "I see where the problem lies, Beam." She tapped the blackboard where the incantations for the fire spell resided. "You don't quite comprehend yet the gift that we've all been given." She glanced at all the ponies there. "Yes, maybe some of you aren't unicorns, but understanding how to manipulate the elements with your own magic, whatever brand, is like being in tune with the Empress herself."\n\nHer eyes sparkled. Beam groaned softly and rubbed her forehead. "The time for other skills will come eventually, but now you must follow in her hoofsteps! Look to her! Look to how she has saved us all to be motivation for you to continue! If we were all—"\n\n"If we were all like Daybreaker, Harmony would stand undefeatable," the entire class echoed, although the lack of affect in the students' voices made Beam struggle to continue. Daisy smirked, and she nodded. "See? Everypony agrees. Will you not at least try to emulate the Empress?"\n\nPushing aside a snarky comment on genocidal tendencies from her mind, Beam slowly bobbed her head and mumbled, "Sure." Her mind weighed heavily, though. Wasn't like there was much reason.\n\nDaisy perked up. "Excellent! Now, if we all turn to page six hundred and forty-seven, we'll—"\n\nBeam groaned."

A round of groans reached her from the assembled students in the room. Smiling, she rested her pointer on the desk and gave a warm, slightly bemused chuckle. Shaking her head, she pointed to the nearest student and asked, "What is the defining characteristic of a pony? What makes them, well, a pony?"\n\n"A cutie mark?" the student inquired, his voice dripping with frustration.\n\n"Mmm, but what of the foals who haven't earned them yet?" Glancing around the classroom, Australis let out a knowing giggle and then inquired, "Any others?" Although it seemed like a number of students were on the cusp of answering, none sprung forth to provide the answer she sought.\n\nInwardly, she huffed and grumbled about the lack of motivation. It had taken her time to reach enlightenment, but this generation was growing up in a state of knowledge. Daybreaker was not veiled behind that weaker alicorn like when she was still young. They got to see the Empress in all her glory, from their very first breaths.\n\nForcing a smile upon her face, Australis pointed to another student who was tiredly staring out the window and asked, "Rivet, what do you think?" The young mare jerked upright, her eyes wide momentarily before she stammered and stuttered a few times. Australis's grin began to crack.\n\nWhen Rivet still stumbled over her words, Australis clapped a hoof against the desk and called out another. The same question. The same bumbling response. As the seconds dragged on, her eyesight twinged red, and she breathed heavily, pumping a hoof in and out from her chest a couple of times. At last, she stated, "I shall answer it. It looks like everypony needs to study more."\n\nShe frowned. "I will be assigning additional homework to make up for this gap in your knowledge."\n\nAs moans reached her, she brightened immediately and declared, "It is not the cutie mark, it's not the three races, it's not our lovable demeanor that makes a pony a pony. It's our Empress. For she is the paragon of all these, and more!" Another round of groans. She flicked her ears, but didn't react otherwise. "We cannot achieve her intelligence, we cannot achieve her power, we cannot even achieve her beauty." She leaned forward. "Therefore, we must accept that we will have to follow her. We do so willingly. The other species, they do not." She snorted. "And they'll pay dearly for it.""

  solarreworked.332.d:0 "Wringing his hooves together, Borehole darted his eyes nervously around the atrium outside of the throne room within [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Around him, palace guards and servants flitted to and fro, all of them warily watching him and the small number of others waiting in line behind him. Each breath seemed to come at a cost, as he inhaled the tension that was palpable from the others and it only further fed his own frantically beating heart.\n\nThe murmurs of those behind him quickly turned to hushed whispers as the door to the throne room was opened and two guards motioned for Borehole to move. Nervously swallowing, Borehole inched forward before he was grabbed by one of the guards and jostled into the throne room. He yelped.\n\n"Silence!" ordered the soldier, and he clamped his mouth shut. "Do not waste the Empress's time. She has been gracious to allow her citizens to speak to her directly at all." At that, he was pushed ahead, and he stumbled into a rather awkward and unsteady bow.\n\n"What is your case, citizen?" Borehole shivered. He heard her voice. HER voice! She was speaking to him!\n\nAs much as his knees knocked together, he urged himself to voice his thoughts. Licking his dry lips which were made even more cracked by the heat of the throne room, he stated, "My Empress, I seek to know your thoughts on what I should do. I feel haunted by nightmares. I cannot sleep without tossing and turning for hours, pondering my move and whether I should seek to mend my relationship with my brother, whom has—"\n\nAs he continued on, he glanced up briefly and felt his train of thought hitch when Daybreaker yawned. He barely caught the motion from his position. With a stutter, he finished, "And he has only recently asked for forgiveness and to return to assisting with my—"\n\n"Get up. I will look at you in the face when I say this," Daybreaker interjected with a huffy command. Eagerly rising to his hooves, Borehole stepped a couple of paces back as he gazed into her piercing yellow eyes. She sneered.\n\n"Do I look like a family therapist?" She snorted. "A sob story, to be sure. Ignore him. Give him the cold shoulder. Don't waste time on his drivel." At that, she waved a hoof in disinterest. Nickering, she added, "Now, go. I'm done wasting my time with this."\n\nAs he was grabbed, he asked, "Is that wisest, Empress? It may only—"\n\nBiting his tongue, he saw Daybreaker frown, and the guards also stopped pulling him back. Daybreaker sneered. "'Wise?'" she echoed. Slinking down from her throne, she trotted toward him, her mane blazing bright blue and nearly scalding his face as she grew close. "Does a simple CITIZEN question my advice? Can the Empress make a mistake?"\n\nWhen she cupped his chin into her hooves, he whimpered and shook his head. Daybreaker bared her teeth in a wicked grin and chuckled.

When he got up from his knees, he held his tongue as she inspected one of her forehooves with mild disinterest. Learning that he shouldn't speak until spoken to was a lesson that he still recalled quite vividly.\n\nDaybreaker arched a brow. "You come with something, nephew?" To match her curiosity, however minuscule, her mane flicked and flapped a tad more insistently than it normally did. A small glob of fire flung off it, soon sizzling on the marble floor. She eyed him in thought.\n\nAfter a couple of seconds, Blueblood smiled and he declared, "But of course, Auntie, how could I be your nephew without giving you a gift every so often?" With a coy snort, he exclaimed, "The very thought!" At that, his horn lit and he pulled from his uniform a small box. Daybreaker's eyes glowed in anticipation.\n\nWith a light clearing of his throat, he proclaimed as she genuflected in front of her again, "Behold! A Molten Acorn! So named due to its large size and proximity to the volcano on the Dragon Isles!" He whipped open the lid. Inside, a large stone, easily half the size of his hoof, glimmered and glittered from the moats of lava in the throne room. It surface danced in time with the lava, appearing to ripple and roar by a spell that barely constrained it.\n\nPuffing out his chest, Blueblood smiled to himself and crooned, "Of course, I have only acquired this through the most difficult circumstances. My ponies' lives were sacrificed all for this gift to you." He continued to kneel.\n\nMomentarily, there was silence, then Daybreaker rose from her throne. She trotted lightly, descending the dais of the throne room with barely any noise. When she arrived in front of Blueblood, she picked up the stone in her magic and gazed at it. Blueblood craned his neck to watch her, heart pounding.\n\n"Catching," she quipped as she inspected it. "But I already have one." She smirked.\n\nBlueblood's breath caught in his throat. "A-Already have one?! B-But they're nigh impossible to acquire! Their rarity is—"\n\n"Blueblood!" she snapped, her mane flashing a bright white for a second. "I've spoken! I already have one." At that, she sauntered back to her throne while still holding the gem. As she plopped herself back onto the seat, she chirped, "General Sonne already got one for me last week."\n\n"Impossible! I would have—" When Daybreaker merely quirked a brow upward, Blueblood sighed. His face growing red, he leveled a hoof at her. "I won't be bested by a sycophantic upstart!" Daybreaker tittered at his outcry. Spinning on his hooves, he marched out of the throne room, a new fire burning in his chest."

How in Tartarus did this clearly infatuated stallion keep showing him up? After how many bits did he acquire that Windigo's Crown? There were what, three in existence? Yet she already had one from Sonne?!\n\nKicking his quarter's door open, he didn't even bother to acknowledge the two guards standing outside as he frequently did. When the doors slammed shut, he tossed his cap clean across the room, missing its peg by a mile. He briefly looked at it on the floor. Bemoaning his predicament with a rage-filled squeal, he ignited his horn and a beam of golden magic shot from its tip.\n\nThe cap burst into flames, almost immediately turning to ash.\n\nThe aroma of burnt fabric and melted leather filled his nostrils. Yet that barely satiated his blood-thirst. What else could he possibly hope to acquire that could show Daybreaker that he would always stand with her?\n\nHe subconsciously rubbed his neck.\n\nUndoing his uniform, Blueblood sighed as he locked the door shut. It was still daytime, but any desire to spend it anywhere but researching other possible avenues for gifts was far from his mind. With every step he took, he heard her words ringing in his head. It was almost like she considered this General Sonne another nephew! He nickered at the very concept.\n\nAs he tramped across the marble floor of his quarters, he grabbed more books from his small library. Although not more than a couple of bookshelves, they were his. And they were where he'd first learned of both the Molten Acorn and Windigo's Crown gems. There had to be something else that he could claim for her. Show her that he always thought of her first.\n\nHe shuddered as that idea went through him. Still, her words to him when he pledged allegiance to her were clear. If nothing else, he was keeping his own skin attached.\n\nSettling into the chair behind his desk, he whirled through the pages and chapters, barely spotting the sun duck low and finally disappear behind the horizon. In time, his eyes burned, but he didn't dare blink, in case he miss anything in the collections. As his head threatened to slam into the desk, sleep dragging him into its inexorable realm, he bolted upright.\n\n"A-ha!" he exclaimed. One of his eyelids twitched a couple of times. He'd found it.

It wasn't like the last five times Gilded hadn't tried to schmooze her way into a better position within the government.\n\nTaking a sip of her tea, Daybreaker forced a laugh from her throat. "Oh, think nothing of it, Gilded." She stared daggers into Gilded's golden eyes. Imagining the mare's greyed mane bursting into flame, Daybreaker shot another grin Gilded's way. "After all, it is my... duty to listen to the concerns of my ministers." She coughed. "Mostly." She mumbled the last portion under her breath.\n\nEither ignoring it or not hearing it, Gilded supped on her own cup of tea and nodded. "Of course, of course!" She scrunched her muzzle. "Is there nothing more... medicinal that can be provided before we continue? I have a most terrible—"\n\nDaybreaker groaned quietly.\n\n"No, we having nothing more than tea. Understood?" She arched a brow. Gilded nodded, although she huffed and guzzled the rest of her tea down before grimacing.\n\nBefore Daybreaker could say anything further, though, there was a beleaguered command to open the doors to the sunroom that the two were in and Daybreaker glanced up as the doors burst open. Blueblood staggered inside. His mane was wild, unkempt, and frayed. Mania gripped his eyes, their pupils constricted to mere pinpricks. In his magic, he held a flaming shard. Daybreaker couldn't help but gasp.\n\n"I HAVE IT!" Blueblood proclaimed, his voice nothing more than a husky scratch. He cackled. "It took millions of bits, and thousands of ponies, but General Sonne can go kiss my flank! I. Have. IT!" Stumbling a few paces inward, he jerked his head to look at the teapot, and then without asking, snatched it before chugging its entire, scalding contents.\n\n"Empress, please have this—" Daybreaker ignored Gilded's request. In fact, she enveloped Gilded in a glow of magic, and the unicorn disappeared with a small pop of a teleportation spell.\n\n"What is it, nephew?" she inquired steadily.\n\n"The only Daybeam Fragment left in the whole world!" screamed Blueblood, his voice stronger after the tea. "Primordial magic sealing a small piece of your own sun for use by the great archmage Narssis!" He whooped. "Sonne will never top this!"\n\n"Of course," quipped Daybreaker with a shrug. "I made him up."\n\n"What."\n\nGetting to her hooves, Daybreaker snatched the magical shard and stated, "I didn't have anything you brought me before, Blueblood. I merely wanted to see how far you'd go for me. " She grinned and patted him on the head. "You did well." As she inspected the Daybeam Fragment, she added, "You may go now. Get some rest, nephew."\n\nBlueblood gawked at her. In a blood-curdling scream, he galloped out the room before collapsing in a heap, exhaustion clearly taking him.\n\nDaybreaker giggled."

For further clarification on breadth of correction recommended for criminal actions, please refer to Appendixes A and C, or turn to Paragraph 1183, Section C, Subparagraph 7 to begin the detailed list of appropriate judgements.\n\nMANDATORY DONATIONS TO CHARITY:\n\nAll ponies, from newborns to the elderly, must donate a portion of their income, defined in Section D, Subparagraph 11, based on bracket and tax status. Failure to comply is a criminal offense and will immediately require a 50% donation to a charity of the Empress's choosing, a list provided in Appendix B.\n\nMANDATORY COMMUNITY SERVICE:\n\nPonies from the age of 7 to 97 are required, unless serving in the military, to submit documents proving they have spent at minimum 500 hours in volunteer positions per month to prove they are assisting the less fortunate. Failure to achieve this minimum will result in forceful volunteer and community service until a total of 15000 hours have been served.\n\nRepeated offenses of the community service laws indicates compulsive, deviant behavior, and ponies will be placed in custody, where they will labor for the benefit of the Empire until death takes them.\n\nThese laws and the rest contained herein have been approved by Daybreaker Sun, Empress of the Solar Empire and Guardian of Harmony, Sol Invictus.\n\nHarmony will protect."

  solarreworked.341.d:0 "Exhaling loudly through his nose, Golden Parachute tapped his front hooves rapidly on the table which sat in front of him. He cast around his gaze. Each of the other ponies in the meeting room with him had just as many lines furrowed onto their brows as the faint ticking of the clock on the wall started to bore into his brain. A couple of beads of sweat trickled down the back of his neck and he batted at it limply.\n\nAfter a few more seconds, he finally heard somepony ask, "So... does ANYPONY have an idea?" He whipped his head to glare directly at the pony who spoke. Of course, one of the green cabinet members. Bleeding Heart, or something like that.\n\nGolden huffed and drummed his hooves on the table more intensely. With each heavy beat, he caught Bleeding wince and flinch, and he couldn't help but force out a terse laugh. Flicking his ears a couple of times, he absentmindedly plodded the ground with a hind hoof. "You think we're not racking our heads for one?" he snarked, which earned a whinny from Bleeding.\n\n"Well, you have brain cells, rub them together," she quipped back. Folding her forelegs across her chest, she leaned back and shot him a bemused scowl. Golden glanced at the clock again. They'd been in the meeting for almost two hours. Just a few minutes left. If there wasn't SOMETHING they could show...\n\nHe unconsciously reached for his neck with a hoof.\n\nHe swallowed. "Well?!" he snapped. "Anything?! We've already tried 'Granny Street Assistance' idea. Not enough grandmothers cross the street and young foals who could help."\n\nWincing, he pinched the bridge of his nose. That was probably one of the only concepts they had. Did it help a few ponies? Yes. Did it help enough? Not particularly.\n\nAfter a few seconds of silence, he caught Bleeding state, "Well, I DO have one, actually." At that, all eyes turned on her, and she snorted. "Oh, now you want to hear what I have to say. Not like last time where I was shot down because I was 'too new'?" She flexed her forehooves, then coughed.\n\n"I suggest we reform the welfare system. How about..."\n\nAs she dug into her plan of requiring extensive community service and dropping of those who could volunteer somewhere but don't, Golden's brain kicked into overdrive and he started scribbling, as with his other economic cabinet peers. When the clock struck five, he glanced up, but without the fear filling his veins.\n\nThey'd found a solution. They'd helped more ponies.\n\nFor another day, anyway."

In the back of her mind, she reminded herself again why she always, from her very youngest days, despised interacting the bloodsuckers that clung to her government like parasites. She barely registered when she was addressed. Again.\n\nLike they even deserved her acknowledgement. After all, they were only interfering in HER protection of HER ponies and of HER Order.\n\n"Empress!"\n\nSnapped out of her rumination by the barking voice of one of the nobles that sat in the marbled seats of the House of Lords, she fixed him with a withering glare. He didn't flinch, although she did spot that a couple of beads of sweat broke out on his neck. Her voice was low. "What?" she demanded.\n\nHesitation. Weakness. He stalled by peering at one of his equals. Another complete waste of air.\n\nAs he drew up the thick stack of papers that the entire parliament had been deliberating on for hours, along with arguing with Daybreaker over it, he stuttered, "These measures, they are... rather extreme, don't you think? If they are held for long, well—" He coughed "—they'd cause grave damage to everypony." Tapping on the stack, he stated, "The economy, after all."\n\nFor a few seconds, Daybreaker merely stared at him, then she broke into a cackle. "Oh, you're concerned about losing a few bits while my ponies suffer and are threatened by enemies at our gates?" She stepped forward. Mane billowing brightly, she demanded, "You DARE assert that I don't have the best interests of my ponies?"\n\n"O-Of course not!" His face turned pallid. Drawing himself up straighter, he glanced at his fellow nobles and stated, "But it is our duty to question the wisdom of some of these measures. Pulling too many able-bodied to the front could—"\n\n"Prevent more ponies chafing under the yoke of our enemies!" interjected Daybreaker with a stomp of her hoof. As she wished she could bore holes into his head with her eyes alone, she finally barked, "I did not come here to be grilled! I came for your assent! If you will not provide it—" She breathed in deeply "—then I don't need it."\n\n"You can't just—"\n\n"Oh, I can," she snarled. "In fact..." Tilting her head and glowering at the noble, she hissed, "I think I can also advertise there's a new vacancy in your seat." At that, two guards approached, and she grabbed the stacks of paper.

Her horn lit brightly for a moment, and she felt a cool sensation wash over her. She flared her nostrils. When she reached the middle of the stage, she gazed out, into the streets of [3.GetCapitalNameDef].\n\nCalming rays of sunlight bathed the square in which she had had the dais erected. As far as the eye could see, the heads and manes of ponies filled the square itself, bobbing like they were blades of grass undulating in the wind. She smirked momentarily and rubbed at her neck again.\n\nShe glanced to the side. Nodding at Raven Inkwell, who had followed her close to the platform, she flicked open a locked chest that was carried by the unicorn and floated out a number of small orbs, perfect crystals of various shapes. A star, a diamond, an apple, a balloon, a bolt of lightning, and butterfly. For a moment, she stared at the nearly perfectly carved objects.\n\nShe frowned. A single crack was almost imperceptible on the star. Snorting, she shot Raven a bemused frown and Raven backed away with a bow. Robotically, Daybreaker began to place each crystal into a matching hole on her peytral, three to each side. As she placed the last one, the star, into it, she scrunched her brow and grunted.\n\nSlowly, her magic's field faded, but she still kept the energy flowing through her horn. After a couple of seconds, she squinted and opened her eyes. Breathing deeply, she boomed, her voice amplified with one of her spells, "Ponies of the Empire! Watch and know you are protected!"\n\nAt that, she fed another spell subtly through her horn. In a flash of light, a blinding rainbow shot from behind the stage, spraying across the sky in a kaleidoscope of color. Within seconds, flames burst from before her, and the very ground itself appeared to shake beneath her hooves. Ponies yelped and ducked for cover.\n\nWith a smirk, Daybreaker declared, "The Elements of Harmony bow once again to me! They shall be used for only the good of Harmony and Order! Let our enemies tremble at the might we wield, for they will suffer the wrath of Harmony itself!" At that, one more jet of prismatic color shot from behind the stage.\n\nAfter the display, she dismissed them all. Words spread like wildfire of the Elements' new use. As she caught the hushed murmurs rising as a din, Daybreaker coughed and trotted to the end of the stage. She winced and scratched at her neck again. The scars would take long to heal.\n\nEven the Empress of ponies couldn't overpower Harmony's will nor escape its anger."

  solarreworked.347.d:0 ""Where did THEY come from?!" Noble Stalk demanded as she darted for cover behind a couple of barricades nearby. Bullets whizzed around her and impacted the hastily-placed cement blocks. Beside her, Packing Heat ducked into the barrier's temporary shielding. As he did, he lobbed a grenade with his magic, and the resulting explosion shook Noble to her core.\n\n"Weren't the rebels being driven AWAY from our location?" Heat belted out as he briefly attempted to return fire. While they were not in a large city, the town in which they had been brought was large enough to have proper urban warfare. Noble still caught the crackle of comments from the radio operator outside the settlement, relaying commands to different squads.\n\nThey were just guard one of the captured rebel positions. When was that supposed to be overly dangerous?\n\nAs more bullets flew through the air, Heat cursed and held a hoof over his shoulder. Noble caught the lodged piece of concrete sticking out under the hoof. Although not gushing, a steady stream of blood trickled out from the wound. Heat gritted his teeth.\n\nShe took up his weakened defense, and she heard him call into their radio, "This is Squad Metamorphic. Enemy contact. Repeat: enemy contact! Count ten strong."\n\nThere was some chatter on the radio when he finished. After a few seconds, somepony asked, not to him, "Did everypony catch that? Who's closest to the depot that was taken?" As some of the different squads railed off their locations and proximity, the same pony on the radio inquired, "What of the Empress? She was near and this is an—"\n\n"She's gone!" another soldier declared.\n\n"She can't have just disappeared. We would have heard the fight from across town!"\n\nAs the radio crackled silent for a moment, Noble heard the hum of magic, and she stared up toward it. Her eyes widened. In a luminous ball of energy, she saw the form of Daybreaker barrel toward the rough location of some of the surprise rebels. She covered her eyes when there was a deafening blast and searing warmth washed over. Orange flames licked at the edges of the barricade.\n\nShrieks and screams reached her ears as furious whinnies also rose into the air. Another series of rushes of fire carried to her, and a tongue of it wrapped around their cover. Heat yelped as some of it engulfed him, and he batted frantically at it. As he struggled, she dove to try and put him out, and barely noticed the hooves making their way toward her.\n\nAs she continued to beat at the flames trying to remain on his arm, she looked up and gasped. Daybreaker merely watched her, eyes flaring in fury. Without a word, the Empress stalked away, and Noble spotted the charred corpses laying on the street."

The soft din of the office building he was in barely carried through to him as he poured over a couple of other sheets that he held in his magic. He sighed, almost nothing more than a zephyr of air.\n\nReleasing the reports, he glanced up at the clock on his floor. He caught a couple of mares chatting on their way to their own desks, and he nodded at one who captured his eye. After a couple of seconds, though, he returned to his work, his brain practically begging for release and freedom.\n\nHow many years was he at this now? Seven? Eight? Ten?\n\nWhen was the last time he'd gotten proper recognition? He scoffed to even think of the possibility.\n\nAs his thoughts settled into another steady state, a plodding sound grew at the end of the hallway, and he caught the insistent voice of his manager protest, "Y-You can't just interrupt our work day! Investors—" He shrieked, then the doors burst open. Instantly, a dozen soldiers marched into the room and began to trundle down the three aisles that made up the office.\n\nEach group stopped at every desk, evaluating them rapidly. Number Crunch's heart leapt into his throat, and he began to jiggle one of his hindlegs without thinking. The slight jostle on his desk spilled his coffee, which clattered to the floor but not before staining all of his papers that he was going through.\n\nWith a frantic whinny, he shot back and tried to brush himself off from the still scalding liquid. As he did, he caught some hooves trotting up to him, and a young voice inquire, "A little trouble there?" He glanced up to see a youthful stallion staring at him. The stallion wore a smug smirk.\n\nNumber just swallowed. The stallion continued, clapping his hooves to the other soldiers with him, "You won't have to worry about coffee stains much longer. Privates, lead him away. He will serve perfectly on—"\n\nBefore the stallion could finish, Number's mind went into overdrive, and he did the one thing that could possibly work. He collapsed in a heap. Crying deafeningly, he moaned, pitching his voice as high and as limp as possible, "Can't move. Leg. Disabled. Can't fight. Horn. Disabled."\n\nThe officer arched an eyebrow. "Are you now?" He jerked his head to the soldiers. "Good thing there's a little trick called magic that can fix you right up, ain't it?"\n\nAs Number was hauled to his hooves, he grinned and let out an awkward chuckle. "Uh, brain. Disabled?""

With a spring in her step, she trotted over to a nearby table in her lab, passing through a couple of diffuse clouds of vapor from a set of tubes and beakers, and placed a syringe on the clean, metal surface. Flipping through a couple of books that rested there, she continued apace the melody that was stuck in her head.\n\nGlancing out the small window that looked out into Ponyville, she let out a small sigh. Since moving back, it had felt like old times. Just with a few more scared ponies. But when were there not horrified, terrified, and mortified residents within the town? She nary watched some pegasi fly by before she twirled on her hooves. Withdrawing a tiny beaker from its surrounding lab equipment, she hungrily eyed the greenish liquid that had coalesced inside.\n\nWith just the faintest movement, it bubbled and sparked. She grinned.\n\nAfter filling the syringe with it, she squeezed the plunger ever so slightly and the needle spurted out a thin line of green. The liquid sizzled as soon as it landed on the metal.\n\n"Okay! Ready for something exciting?!" she exclaimed, whipping around again to face toward the back of her lab. Through the hodgepodge of assorted devices, two ponies lay strapped to tables, gagged and unable to answer. However, she could see the anticipation in their eyes. "Great!" she proclaimed.\n\nPrancing toward the first captive, she prattled on, "This is just a catalyst for the REAL stuff, but you may feel a few side effects, including nausea, incontinence, sudden desire to read music backward, and a slight chance of spontaneous combustion." She frowned at the last one. "I think, anyway." As she reached the victim, she hummed again and lit her horn. She injected some of the green liquid, and as she did, her magic enveloped it, making it glow a bright orange as it was shot into the prisoner.\n\nAfter a few seconds, she exclaimed, "There! See? Wasn't so hard." She trotted over to the other pony. "Now, if it works right, that'll boost your immune systems, permanently, by five hundred percent!" She tittered. "With soldiers to defend Harmony who never get sick, imagine how much—"\n\nBefore she could finish, the first pony began to writhe as much as she could, and managed to spit out the gag. She shrieked, squealed, groaned, and moaned as Sunrise watched, bemused.\n\nEyes growing wide, Sunrise stepped a couple paces back as the mare coughed, choked, and then fell limp, her skin rapidly decaying off her skeleton. Within moments, she was nothing but a pile of bones and a goopy mess on the floor. Sunrise huffed.\n\n"That was unexpected. Maybe the immune system goes into response overdrive, too."

These whole things are meant to be gamed, anyway." He furtively checked his shoulders. "Even found an earlier version with all the possible combinations." He smirked. "Already have this in the bag."\n\nBefore she could quip anything back, Cheesecake heard their professor clear his throat, and she zipped back to a properly sitting position.

While there are no wrong answers, do make sure to answer honestly and with forethought." He faintly rolled his eyes.

What did shoving a harmonic resonator up somepony's flux capacitor have to do with anything? And the answers...\n\nShe huffed, and went with the first one that came to mind.\n\nAs she continued through the questions, each as equally absurd and not relevant to her chosen path, aside from a few, she glanced at Sunflower. He was sweating. Catching that, her heart went silent. Her blood froze. Her hairs stood on end.\n\nWhen her pulse finally restarted, she whimpered and continued on. Only one question was easy, and made sense. Who did they owe their lives and everything to? Daybreaker, and Harmony. Thankfully that was the only answer.\n\nAs her professor collected all the test results, she swallowed and glanced away. Ages seemed to pass before she was returned her results.

There was still nothing conclusive on why she was brought in to him. Although he'd gone over the report of her arrest half a dozen times, the details of it still caused his brain to scream in agony.\n\n"All right," he huffed at last, slamming the clipboard back on his desk.

Agreeing to Blueblood's request that she provide insight into utilizing magic in field operations was not first on her list of things to do, but ensuring that she was not moaned to by him if his recruits didn't meet his standards was. Besides, it was only one lesson, anyway. Two hours out of her day was irritating, but not insurmountable.\n\nHowever, before she could fully decide upon whether to highlight the efficacy of infernal magic in firefights or the counters to various assault spells, her ears pricked up. Somepony had screamed.\n\nAll of her guards likewise turned in the same direction, to the east, and readied their weapons. A second scream followed, then silence.\n\nSeconds later, a stallion with a short-cropped mane burst from the alleyway in that direction. Peering left and right for naught but a moment, he bolted down the street. At first, Daybreaker considered dismissing it, then she discerned the small blot of blood he left behind.\n\nWithout waiting for her guards to react, she flapped twice with her wings and propelled herself into the alley. It was dim, but her mane illuminated the walls on either side. She caught her troops rushing after her, and she continued further inside, her horn now flaring with a readied bolt of energy. As she inched deeper in, a body appeared as the darkness was pulled away like a blanket.\n\nA mare. A pool of blood spread underneath her.\n\nInstantly dropping her spell, Daybreaker leaped toward the mare and landed with a thud. She knelt down. The mare still breathed, albeit weakly. From the splatter on the wall a few inches away, she must have been knocked against it. A number of bits lay on the ground, as well as an empty saddlebag.\n\n"Who—" Daybreaker began. She halted. There was only one pony who could have done that. The stallion. Instead, she sat the mare up so they could look at each other. The mare's eyelids fluttered as her head limply fell to the side. "What's missing? What happened? Why—" She didn't finish. The mare's head fell forward, and her breath failing almost entirely.\n\nDaybreaker stood up. Brows furrowed, she snapped, "Cancel my itinerary! I'm returning to the palace." She gazed at the mare again."

  solarreworked.355.d:0 ""Day—Empress, I don't believe that this is wise," Raven Inkwell protested as she marched alongside Daybreaker. Every step that they took, Daybreaker's mane thrashed and whipped around, tossing hot globs of fire and lava-like goop onto the floor. Blackened singe marks appeared in their wake.\n\n"Is it?" demanded Daybreaker as she suddenly halted. Stumbling to a stop after Daybreaker, Raven went a few paces past before she could turn around to flash a worried stare at the alicorn. In Daybreaker's eyes, a vortex of fury whirled like a tornado of fire. Her mane itself was a bright blue, and the heat thereof was nearly unbearable.\n\nRaven tugged at her collar and stepped back a smidgen. "Well, aside from canceling everything today—"\n\n"For good reason!" Daybreaker snapped back. One of her eyelids twitched. Stalking closer to Raven, she snarled, "I saw an injustice, Raven. One of my ponies, hurt by they're own. And the fiend escaped, without any retribution for his crimes!" At that, she slammed a hoof into the floor, enough to rattle Raven enough to knock her glasses off. When she pulled the hoof away, a crater was left in the marble. Cracks had spread like spiderwebs across the surface.\n\n"This brigand is at large. I was the one who saw him. I will be the one to find him and make. Him. Pay!" She flared her nostrils. Snorting testily at Raven, she growled, "Nopony will stop me, not even you, Raven." She furrowed her brow. "Do I make myself clear?"\n\nRaven wiped sweat from her brow before fixing her glasses back on the bridge of her nose. Anxiously, she took another step back and spotted a few servants had stopped in their bustle around the palace and watched them. She cleared her throat. "I'm merely wanting to remind you that there are authorities who can deal—"\n\n"They will never find him!" Daybreaker bellowed. "A petty criminal is beneath their concern, anyway. I must deal with this. Myself."\n\nTension hung between them. Shuffling her hooves on the floor, Raven squeezed her eyes shut and heaved a long-suffering sigh. Although everything had already been marked as canceled on her clipboard, she swiped through them all with a quill she conjured. "All right," she grumbled, "what should I give for a reason for canceling your schedule?"\n\n"Field foray," quipped Daybreaker.\n\n"And you'll go alone?" At Raven's question, Daybreaker quirked a brow. "Empress, you will be rather conspicuous either way, and with guards you'll—"\n\nDaybreaker powered her horn. As she was surrounded by a field of red magic, she asked, "Who said I'd be visible?" When the spell disappeared, in her place was a yellow-maned pegasus with striking purple eyes. She primped her mane. "All Golden Feather is going to do is go for a little walk alone. Perfect prey for any mugger."\n\nRaven suppressed a groan."

  solarreworked.356.d:0 "Curve Ball tapped one of his hind hooves against the cobbled street. Both his saddlebags felt like they were carrying the world inside of them. While there were only a couple hundred bits at most, plus a few pieces of jewelry, his mind kept flashing back. It was just a simple job, he was told. Nothing to be concerned about. No excess violence.\n\nNopony was supposed to bleed. Just rough them up, take off if they refuse. No point sticking around long enough for the fuzz to show up. Or worse. The Guard.\n\nGlancing up at the sun, he flung away some drops of sweat that had formed on his brow. Around him, ponies trotted, traipsed, and trundled by, ignoring him, despite the distress that he was sure he must have been exuding. After all, it was lunchtime, and ponies still had their days to go through. He himself had to keep up appearances. Finding the right mark was always a bit of a challenge.\n\nHe passed by a ragged stallion, sitting on the ground and holding up a mug as ponies cantered by. Briefly, Curve stood in front of the stallion and he swallowed. Digging into his saddlebags, he grabbed a couple of bits and dropped them into the mug. The stallion nodded gratefully at him.\n\nBefore he could move, though, somepony bumped into him, and he staggered to the side. "Hey! Watch it!" he protested, but the pony in question already passed him by. All he saw was the tail end of a pegasus mare with a golden mane. She seemed in a hurry. There was also a crowd.\n\nAnd a side alley nearby.\n\nHumming, he galloped after her and called out, "Hey! Filly!" She didn't notice him at first, but that was acceptable. He waved a small pouch he pulled from his saddlebags. Waving it in the air, he exclaimed, "You dropped this!" That, however, did grab her attention.\n\nShe shouted something back at him. He shivered as her purple eyes peered at him. There was something familiar in them. Still, duty called. Thankfully, the crowd was thick, so he motioned toward the alley, where it was clear. He waved the bag again. She nodded.\n\nNopony paid them any mind. Swallowing deeply, he motioned for her to take a couple steps further back, and he stated, "Yeah, looks like you dropped this when we bumped into each other." He hoofed it toward her. As he did, he brought out a blade that was attached to his other hoof, and he dove toward her."
  solarreworked.356.a:0 "Should be an easy win."
  solarreworked.357.t:0 "No Ordinary Mare"
  solarreworked.357.d:0 "Before he could realize what happened, Curve Ball flew back as the golden-maned pegasus mare lashed out with a hoof, almost impossibly quick. As the hoof connected with his jaw, there was a crack and crunch, and he yelped as a coppery liquid gushed into his mouth. He landed flat on his back, dazed.\n\nIt only lasted a few seconds, and he whirled to his feet. His jaw hung limply, although it throbbed and screamed in pain as he tried to touch it. With effort, he spat out the blood that had pooled inside. As he continued to gingerly fondle his mouth, he whimpered and started to backpedal away from the pegasus mare.\n\nHis heartbeat skyrocketed. Nothing but unadulterated rage was on her face. A scowl so deep, it was like gazing into the canyons of Galloping Gorge made his brain kick into overdrive. It was time to retreat.\n\nTwirling around, he scampered forward a foot before he was knocked to the ground. He landed on his jaw again. Adrenaline saved the worst of the pain, though. However, despite his attempts at clawing away from her were for naught. With little effort, he was dragged further into the alley, the darkness from the shadows of the houses and businesses leaving him in partial obscurity.\n\nUnceremoniously, he was flipped around, and the pegasus mare stamped on the hoof that had the hidden blade. There was a loud crunch, and he screeched through his limp jaw as the fetlock flattened an inch or so. The hoof it was attached to suddenly jerked at an odd angle. The mare sneered at him.\n\nGrabbing his other hoof, she twisted with little effort, and searing pain like being branded shot through his entire arm and shoulder. There was a crack, a pop, and a wet clunk. Tears stained his face. Reduced to little more than a blubbering mess, he wheezed painfully, "W-Who are you?"\n\nThe mare's eyes flashed. For a second, the sclera turned a burnt orange and the irises a bright yellow. Curve Ball's blood froze.\n\n"Do I need to deign you with an answer?" the mare asked, pressing the hoof that broke his fetlock further into it. He could feel the shattered bones grinding against each other. Leaning toward him, she hissed, "A pony under my protection was killed because of you." She bared her fangs. "I'm simply enacting justice."\n\n"Please," he whined, "I-I'll talk! I-It isn't just me! It's not my fault!"\n\nShe paused. Glaring at him, she stated, "Go on. I'm feeling merciful."\n\n"Will you let me go?"\n\n"I said I'm feeling merciful." Grinning widely, the pegasus mare demanded, "Do you want to try my patience, too?""

  solarreworked.358.d:0 "Daybreaker's chest burned.\n\nWith every beat of her wings, she propelled herself closer to where that waste of flesh had directed her. To think, that a thieves guild of all things had set itself up underneath her very nose. In her very capital!\n\nTwinges of red painted her peripheral vision. As the moments dragged on, the landscape transitioned from the heart of Canterlot, with brilliant monuments and shining homes, to slightly less well-kept residences. Smoke from factories drifted lazily into the air, as the manufactories were prevented from soiling the pristine inner-city conditions.\n\nHer eyes smarted. Glancing behind her, she saw soot trailing her, and she heard her mane crackling. She breathed deeply. A wash of energy passed over her as she focused. Her disguise would hold. She'd ensure it.\n\nSoon enough, she reached the very edge of the city disk that kept the capital aloft and gloriously above every other pony city. Like had been described, a number of warehouses in an industrial park were soon visible. They all appeared innocent, save for the one or two ponies who were keeping watch out of one. Granted, they were keeping well-hidden, but when warned ahead of time, she could spot them easily. Crates provided little cover from the air.\n\nShe dispatched them quickly, dive bombing directly into one from above. There was a sickening crack from his ribcage. Spinning around, she bucked two crates into the mare guard, then lunged and slammed her skull into the ground. The mare didn't get up as blood seeped into the pavement.\n\nSpringing from the guards' location, she barreled through the front wall of the warehouse, pummeling with debris a couple of ponies inside. Dust caked her fur. She flared her wings. She snarled at all those who gawked at her. An older stallion and mare were standing in front of a table, counting bits. Another pony was putting away apples into crates, as well as some clothing. Obviously more things stolen.\n\nWhat transpired was a blur to her, as her rage at the impunity of these ingrates filled her. Instincts kicking in, her vision became nothing but a sea of red intermittently broken by a scream, gunshot, or wet cracking noise. When her senses finally cleared, she heaved as she felt herself covered in something warm.\n\nShe pressed a hoof to her face and came back with blood. She was covered in it.\n\nAs she caught coughing, she whipped her head around, and saw the older mare gagging for breath. She marched over and pressed on the mare's throat. With a whimper, the mare whined, "We were helping."\n\nDaybreaker scoffed. Lies. All of it. Stomping down, she crushed the mare's windpipe, then checked the boxes. They were all filled with bare necessities. On the table, she spied a ledger. She breathed in at the entries. Community centers. Food banks. Charities.\n\nShe lowered the ledger. Swallowing deeply, she departed without a word, her posture deflated."

  solarreworked.370.t:0 "Fire from Above"
  solarreworked.370.d:0 ""Don't hold back!" Rangefinder heard her commanding officer scream over the roar of battle. Gun fire mixed with the clanking hulks of dragons as she and the rest of her company crept, inch by inch, up to the peak of the tallest mountain within [DRG.GetNameDef]. With every mile gained, she could imagine the blood staining the lifeless, sandy gravel that seemed to make up every inch of the damned island.\n\nScorched flesh still filled her nostrils from the last skirmish. As she looked up, ducked, and rolled to the side as a pillar of fire descended from another dragon, her mind briefly flashed to the last battle. She shivered. Writing bodies, covered in flames, still etched themselves in her mind.\n\nShe jerked back to the present when she caught somepony scream, and barely avoided another jet of heat as three younger dragons charged at the company of infantry. Their scales were covered by brilliant bronze armor plates, which ricocheted bullets when they hit. However, their scales themselves did little. Although they reached the soldiers, one collapsed into the dirt, dead, and another was wounded and could barely cough enough fire to light a match.\n\nThe last did manage to unleash a torrent of flames, and Rangefinder dove to the ground and covered her head. Around her, shrieks of agony filled her ears, and she uncovered her eyes long enough to see a massive shadow fall across the battlefield. Trailing her gaze upward, her blood ran cold as she saw a massive, armored, ancient dragon take off from the mountain. That was probably the dragons' last hope. Few elders had been encountered in the conquest of the island, but when they did arrive...\n\nShe whimpered when it roared, even from its distance making enough noise to deafen her. With powerful beats of its wings, it sped toward the battlefield, its nose billowing smoke already as a glow started to build behind it bared teeth. As it opened its mouth, she caught two overwhelming retorts from behind her, and whistling shells hurled toward the dragon.\n\nBoth impacted it square in the chest, the first punching through the armor plate, the second, blowing a hole clean through it. Without even a sound, the dragon went limp and tumbled from the sky. As it did, the entire battlefield went silent for a moment, and then she glanced back at the pair of heavy artillery that was trained at the sky. A few of the younger whelps in the fight flung up their clawed hands, and some soldiers stayed behind to guard them.\n\nRangefinder was dragged up by her CO, and she gulped. With a silent order, he made them move out. She glanced up at the peak of the mountain. In a few hours, it'd be over.\n\nMaybe she'd live to tell the tale."

  solarreworked.371.d:0 "Snapple cursed herself.\n\nThat was really the only appropriate thing to do as another bullet whizzed by her head. Flapping her wings a smidgen harder, she ignored the growing pain that had zeroed in on the sockets where they met her back. Every movement made them feel like they were grinding against her bones, but she couldn't give up the escape.\n\nIn her arms, she clutched a small hoard of gems, and their glittering surfaces caught the torchlight and magical illumination that filled the cave that she was hastily exiting. Another gunshot echoed behind her, and a bullet embedded itself in the stone floor just on her heels. She yelped and urged her muscles to work harder.\n\nTurning a bend in the cave, she breathed a sigh as she started to see the dimness of the nighttime outside when there was a deafening siren that reverberated through the underground labyrinth. She hugged the gems tighter. Her stomach growled. As spittle trickled down her chin from feeling the warm, comforting gems so close yet so far, she saw a couple of ponies wielding rifles dash to block off her escape.\n\nShe was going too fast, though.\n\nSteeling herself, she ducked low and barreled through the two guards, sending them staggering back. She barely caught the crack of one's head against the cave wall, and then she was out into the cool darkness of the isles. Her home. At least, what used to be her home, anyway.\n\nShe soared. With her assailants well below her, she slowed and did a quick spin, taking in as much of the surrounding countryside as she could. When she had been taken to the mines, she'd not even seen where it was. She could guess, but seeing it now brought back fresh memories. She wasn't far from the coast.\n\nSneaking to Dovashore to rest would give her enough energy to fly to [IDT.GetNameDef], but it would still be long. She peered at her gems. But those would be—\n\nBefore she could finish her thought, she was bombarded from two sides by blows, and she squawked. Her grip on her jewels faltered, and they disappeared into the night.\n\nRage suddenly flaring in her chest, she built a fireball in her throat, and felt the heat pour out her mouth. A dark shape careened toward her, and she could guess what it was. A pegasus patrol. As her vision turned red, she unleashed the pent up flame, and it zoomed toward the pegasus. However, the silhouette must have been ready, as it dodged, although not without yelping as the fire scorched a wing.\n\nAs the one soldier dove to the ground, she turned in time to grapple the other soldier, and she snarled, "I'm not going back! Find actual weaklings to enslave!" She pushed. For a second, the soldier was sent back, then he quickly let go. Her momentum carried her forward, and he suddenly slammed onto her back.\n\n"That's fine," he hissed as he sent her toward the ground. "More can always be found. The Empress no longer has use of you."\n\nIn her last few seconds, she could only scream and flail."

For once, her mind was at ease, not drifting to the always lingering threat of ponies falling away or of foalish threats to end her life or Order.\n\nEverything was calm.\n\nAfter a moment, she heard a single scream, and she cracked an eyelid open. At first, all she saw was the inviting cerulean blue of the Canterbbean. Rolling whitecaps crashed against the ivory sand on the coast. There was even a gentle breeze, rippling off the ocean itself.\n\nIt was heavenly.\n\nWhen it was quiet, she closed her eyes again, only to be disturbed by another shriek, and she groaned. The ten guards that flanked her rear to protect her shifted uncomfortably, for she could catch their armors' soft clinking and clanking as they fidgeting. She turned her head. To the southwest, about three hundred feet out, a few ponies where frantically running in circles.\n\nAll where scorched red, but she simply huffed at the sight. Too much time in the sun.\n\nSpeaking of, she glanced at it briefly, taking in its golden form that hung in the sky like a brilliant, loving marble. She hummed as she took in the heat from it, and she caught a couple of guards whimper. She huffed. They would have to deal with the heat for a little while longer. She'd only recently arrived at the beach in Puerto Coballo. She wasn't going to waste time indulging their needs. Not like hers.\n\nWith a tired snort, she ordered them quiet, and then then got up to rest in the sand instead. Its blisteringly hot surface was little more than a warm bed for her, and she sighed.\n\nThen she heard another scream.\n\nAnd another.\n\nFlicking her ears a couple of times, she nickered and positioned the sun a bit closer. More shrieks reached her, and she flattened her ears and attempted to ignore them. There were a few whines from her guards, and she finally growled, opened her eyes, and glared back at them. All were drenched in sweat, and their faces were red as they struggled to keep cool in their armor. And the scalding temperatures.\n\nDaybreaker huffed, momentarily noting the smoke rising from the resort nearby, then shrugged. She glanced up at the sun. Its shape was a little bigger, and she could feel even more of its heat burrowing into her fur.\n\nAs her own beach umbrella burst into spontaneous flame, she kicked back and yawned. She adjusted the sun a bit more.\n\nThere were screams, but she ignored them. She had to make her vacation perfect. Even if it meant moving the heavens themselves."

Another growl escaped his throat as he was poked in the hindquarters by a bayonet and he staggered forward into the light from the pitch black interior of his holding cell. Around him, dozens of other changelings, likewise hauled from their own pens, were arranged in a line in the muddy courtyard of one of the Solarist prison camps.\n\nA bitter wind cut through the yard, despite the warmth coming from the sun. Membrane shivered. Every step that he was forced to take was quivering, and as he noticed a couple of unarmed ponies further away from the prisoners, he licked his lips.\n\nAll that he had been given for sustenance was normal, pony food. Perhaps it kept he and his fellow alive, but only barely. Every time he had had to stomach the disgusting meals, it had taken his entire willpower to not retch it back up. It wouldn't matter if it was a cake fit for the damn sun alicorn's gorging, it'd taste like dirt to him.\n\nAt some point, he must have switched instinctively into a stalking posture, because he was whacked by the butt of a rifle and he stumbled forward. With a couple of harsh barks, a pair of soldiers pushed him back into line with the rest of the changelings, who were all beginning to hungrily eye their captors. For his part, Membrane frowned and willed his mind to remain focused.\n\nIt wasn't like he wasn't experienced with a roll call. Of course, if he had any idea of what they were going to do with him, that'd make it slightly less tempting to throw his life away to perhaps feast on one of the ponies' emotions, just to exact a bit of revenge before his inevitable end.\n\nHowever, with how many guards were at attention, that'd probably not be simple.\n\nAs his whole body shook as his emotive sacs burbled and gurgled from emptiness, the two unarmed ponies approached, both officers of [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nThe first one, a mare, eyed him, then approached. Cupping a hoof under his chin, she gave no reaction as he gnashed at her, but he didn't bite, given the guns trained on him. She hummed. "Are you fit, bug?"\n\n"Tell the guards to buck off and find out."\n\nShe smirked. "Amusing. Well, I WAS going to offer some bottled emotions to give you strength for all of your new work assignments in the mines, but with gratitude like that..." She shook her head. "Enjoy the taste of gruel."\n\nAt that, she spun around. Membrane weakly lunged at her, but fell onto his chest instead. He whimpered, his emotion sacs gnawing holes that chewed at his mind."

  solarreworked.374.d:0 ""My, my, you've really got the 'aggressive angst' vibe down pat," Daybreaker quipped with a small titter as she traipsed into one of the larger corridors—if it could be described as that—of the main hive structure in Vraks. Unlike the typical changeling hive that she had seen up to that point in her perusal of her new territory, rather than a cool blue or green, the walls were a deeper red, mixing with the grey of the regular rock to give a subdued, unsettling feel.\n\nCollapsed tunnels occasionally dotted the walls, where either workers of the hive had broken them on purpose, or they had fallen in the firefights that had taken place in the last days of Vraks's independence. Lingering in the air, the stench of soot and burned biomass still assaulted Daybreaker's nostrils.\n\nHowever, she gave a single twirl to make an encompassing sweep of the hive corridor. When she finished, she stopped and gazed expectantly at her entourage. Chained together and carefully restrained with inhibitor rings on their horns, the queens of the largest hives that supported Chrysalis trudged behind her, under heavy armed guard. In the lead, the queen with a crimson mane whipped some of it aside and scoffed, "Oh, I'll be sure to give the decorators word of your approval."\n\nDaybreaker could feel the eyeroll from where she stood. Smirking, Daybreaker stalked closer to the procession. She clicked her tongue. As the guards forced the queens to stop, Daybreaker stared down at the leader. Argynnis. "Such attitude," she declared. "And here I thought that you knew respect."\n\nArgynnis flinched, as did the other queens. Trotting back, Daybreaker asked, "The throne room. Which way?" She snarled when Argynnis didn't reply. "Now!"\n\nWith a grumble, Argynnis divulged the path, and soon they were in the center of the hive, a giant, porous chamber with an obsidian throne where Argynnis would have sat. Daybreaker chuckled. In a simple hop, skip, and jump, she flapped her wings and landed daintily on it before she stated, "Not bad. Lacks flair, but not bad." She tittered. "Such a shame that all this work must be undone, no?"\n\nThe queens remained quiet. With a shrug, Daybreaker asked of one of the guards, "Have the orders been given." He nodded.\n\n"Excellent." She steepled her hooves together, then lit her horn. As the ponies and changelings in the chamber were covered in a shield, there was a blinding explosion. Shock waves ripped through the air, toppling all but Daybreaker to the floor. She bared her teeth as the walls collapsed to reveal Vraks, on fire.\n\n"I think that this sends a clear enough message? You are not Chrysalis, but if any of you dare defy me again...""

Only interspersed, temporary glow lamps had been set up by her occupation force. Occasionally, in one of the surviving rooms of the hive, offices had been set up, and she spotted a couple of personnel toiling away on reports or research.\n\nHowever, her target was not them. Instead, she continued to meander down the corridor she was in, which was a sickly green mixed with the more natural dark grey-blue of stone. Soon reaching an archway, she was greeted by a small company of guards standing outside the one door. The fleshy flap that had been used by changelings had been replaced by a steel door, and they quickly opened it for her.\n\n"You have a visitor, pest!" she declared happily as she sauntered in. Unlike the passageway outside, there was absolutely no light, save for her radiant mane and tail. They cast orange rays upon the room, revealing crags and crannies, and a single cage in the center. When the door had closed, glowing, green eyes revealed themselves, as well as an animalistic hiss.\n\nDaybreaker tsked. "Come now, Chrysalis, is that any way to speak to your better?"\n\nChrysalis spat on the ground. The changeling queen was gaunt, but her eyes still burned with hatred. "Mock me as you wish, disgusting, featherbrained pony, I'll never grovel to you!" At that, Chrysalis chittered and rubbed her wings together. As they buzzed and hummed, Daybreaker shot her a thin smile.\n\n"Is that so? Such a shame I wasn't asking for that." Her horn lit menacingly. Igniting the room in a bright flare of orange, Daybreaker sent fire crawling up the wall and around the cage. Chrysalis flinched, but stayed steadfast. Daybreaker stalked toward her. With every step, the temperature in the cell rose.\n\n"I suppose, in a way, I can thank you for helping motivate my ponies to follow me," admitted Daybreaker with a nonchalant shrug. Stepping closer, she watched as the iron bars of the cage began to slowly melt from proximity to her. Chrysalis started to backpedal.\n\n"But, you and your pathetic, degenerate bugs nearly destroyed my ponies' Harmony. Twice." Daybreaker launched forward. Jabbing her horn through the bars, which started to give way, she snarled as the tip barely avoided skewering Chrysalis's neck, "They lost nearly everything. You shall suffer that, too." She pulled back and bared her teeth. "The pain they felt will be multiplied a HUNDRED times upon you all." She snorted. "I hope you can live with that, before the end, Chryssy."\n\nShe spun and marched from the room."

A soft chuckle escaped her lips at the attire of one, who was doing her best to appear from feeling uncomfortable in the hellish heat that permeated the chamber.\n\nShe was failing.\n\nClearing his throat, the captain in charge of escorting the changelings proclaimed, "The four Queens of the Changelings, Empress, as you requested." She wordlessly dismissed him, and he bowed before stepping back.\n\n"Oh, are we comparing notes on who can be more edgy?" the red-maned one, Argynnis, inquired, her voice laced with derision. "Since I have to rebuild my hive with those PALTRY excuses for rock and stone that you've provided." She sniffed. Almost hidden, though, was a small glimmer of worry that flashed across her eyes. Additionally, there was a slight quiver to her voice, which she had attempted to hide with her snark.\n\nDaybreaker merely grinned. "Brave to insult the one who has let you live thus far," she quipped as she slunk down the dais toward the four queens. She snickered. "Doubly foalish for doing so in her own domain."\n\n"Like you did mine?" Argynnis hissed back.\n\n"You believe that we will give into further bullying?" another queen demanded, Helvia. She brushed aside some of her yellow, membrane-like mane. With a snort, she growled, "If you want to do anything more with us, you may as well kill us."\n\nFeigning shock, Daybreaker pressed a wing to her chest and retorted, "Kill you all? When you are so useful?" Argynnis arched a brow at her, and Helvia's frown softened slightly. The other two murmured amongst themselves. As Daybreaker took another step forward, she blocked some of the light filtering in from the windows overlooking [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], casting a shadow on Argynnis and the queen next to her, Yaria.\n\n"You misunderstand me, I'm merely wishing to... clear the air." Daybreaker's mane whipped about wildly. As it shone a deep orange, she stated, "Oh, I could kill you. I believe we all know you're almost as culpable as your great queen." She earned a scowl from Helvia and a growl from Argynnis. She tittered. As if to emphasize, she lit her horn and ignited Yaria's hat that she had brought. While it went up in flames, she added, "But where the fun in that be? I have a proposition: you know what makes your subjects tick. Order must be enforced there. You will aid me, and, in return..."\n\nLeering closer to the group, she smiled widely, "I shan't make you BEG for death as you suffer your just punishment.""

  solarreworked.377.d:0 "Peering out the glass of the palace of House Jelzek, Daybreaker idly tapped a hoof as she observed the activity of the Olenians within the capital city of Hjortland. Despite how sunny it was, there was still a dusting of snow on the rooftops of some of the houses, making them appear like they had been frosted with icing sugar. At the very thought of that, she licked her lips.\n\nShe sighed and stood back, briefly taking in the woodwork of the throne room, which was so alien to the regal and imposing marble of her own palace. Briefly, she gazed at the portrait of Johan, the Usurper. She smirked. What had been his last pleas when the changelings taken replaced him with a deer more amenable to them? She could only imagine.\n\nOne of her ears twitched as the doors to the throne room opened, and she turned give a playful bow to her new guest. Escorted by a dozen soldiers, Princess Velvet Jelzek gave her one glower and then looked away, thumbing her nose toward the ceiling. With every step she took, the chains that bound her legs together clinked and clanked.\n\n"Ah, Princess Velvet," Daybreaker stated as she waved off her guards. "It was so nice to permit me to use your family home." Gesturing to the woodwork, she added, "You Olenians live in such quaint abodes." She chuckled. Despite her taunting, Velvet remained silent, although she could see that a couple of tears had trickled down Velvet's cheek.\n\nPursing her lips, Daybreaker inquired, "Something wrong, young doe?" A snicker escaped her throat. "Perhaps you believe I will make you an example?" Velvet didn't answer. Baring her teeth in a thin smile, Daybreaker declared, "There's nothing to fear." She held a hoof to her chest. "I swear that no harm will come to you." She winked. "Yet."\n\n"You wish me to beg?" Velvet finally demanded, her voice soft yet steady. "You believe I would bow to a creature with such a hideous sense of fashion and personal hygiene?" She tsked. Rolling her eyes, she grunted, "House Jelzek will never be broken."\n\nAlthough she kept her tone even, Daybreaker's grin widened slightly, and her face muscles tightened. As her mane whipped more violently, she repeated, "No?" She shook her head. "Shame. I suppose I will have to tell your deer myself that you despise them. You do not wish to even out my laws. You desire them to feel my full justice."\n\nAt that, Velvet stuttered and glanced at Daybreaker. Daybreaker sneered. "Oh? You're interested now? I suppose I could change my mind, but I would require..." She tittered. "Submission.""

  solarreworked.378.d:0 "Grabbing a number of binders with her cloven hooves, Velvet of House Jelzek pressed them close to her chest and paused for a moment. She swallowed. Her throat was like it had been gripped in a vice. Each attempt to breathe set her chest on fire while her heart pounded in her chest, carrying up into her ears and sounding like heavy drums beating right into her skull.\n\nEverything around her was drab. The walls were drab. The floor was drab. The PICTURES were drab. Somehow even the pictures that had been placed around her office as an attempt to liven the place only managed to suck more energy from it instead. About the only thing of color was a small flag of [EQS.GetNameDef] that hung over her door.\n\nFor a moment, she stared at the flag. From the depths of her being, her blood boiled whenever the thought of the ponies who now ruled over her came to her mind. Before she could get much further in fury, however, there was a knock on the door, and a voice cried, "Velvet! Integration meeting in room three B! Now!"\n\nAfterward, hooves trotted off and faded away, leaving Velvet glowering in the direction of the voice. Under her breath, she grunted, "Yes, yes, because I have ever been late." She scoffed. Primping some of the fluffy fur on her chest, she kept the binders close to her and trotted out into the hallway.\n\nWas it an irony that she was helping her deer?\n\nA pony passed her. Soon, a couple more did, while she contemplated her position in life. Nopony here bowed to her. Nopony gave her the respect that House Jelzek once had, before Johan, before the changelings. And now, what was she? Simply a pencil pusher that happened to know her country well.\n\nShe sighed. Slowly starting into a canter, she longingly held her gaze on a stack of papers that were in a tray along the wall. The entire shelf was for suggestions on how to properly synthesize a deer and pony administration, and last she counted, about ninety percent of the ideas were hers.\n\nThey'd all been ignored.\n\nLike she was.\n\nBefore she could even realize she was at the meeting room, she was standing in front of the boring, flat door to it. On the other side, she could hear chatter, much like the nobility from her youth did with her father. Except they cared even less about the fate of her deer.\n\nAs she creaked the door open, she spotted a map pinpointing various "improvement zones" that would replace deer with ponies. At that, she whimpered. Holding back a sniffle, she entered her battlefield. As just another government drone."

  solarreworked.379.d:0 "He was massive.\n\nThat was the only thing that ran through Wilted Petal as she watched, wide-eyed, as a yak was prodded through into the construction yard. Like her, practically the entire yard came to a grinding halt as the yak was escorted toward one of the heaviest pieces of machinery there. When one of the guards of their penal unit poked the yak with a bayonet, the yak bellowed once but was quickly aimed at by the rest of the group.\n\nGiven that it was shaggy beyond belief, she could only guess if it was staring down its tormentor or not, but she could feel the tension building before finally it moved toward the machinery and started it up. Immediately, some of the guards relaxed, dispersing to cover the rest of the yard. When she saw the patrols resume, Petal quickly went back to her own task of filling in some concrete, but her mind continuously went back to the yak.\n\nSure, everypony knew about the yaks, but the average pony was unlikely to see one. In the back of her mind, she wrestled with the temptation to go over and speak the yak up. At first, it was only a niggling, but eventually she found herself just staring at the half-filled frame of concrete that would become a foundation pillar, and she flinched.\n\nAfter checking the coast was clear, she slunk up to the machinery, which was helping excavate part of a lower basement. Unsurprisingly, the yak didn't notice her. "Hey," she called out, just loud enough to be heard by the yak. It slightly adjusted its position. Probably saw through the long bangs covering its eyes.\n\n"What dirty pony want?" the yak asked in a gruff, masculine voice. "Gerhard very busy with work." Under his breath, he grumbled, "Although Gerhard want to crush guard skulls beneath his hoof!"\n\nPetal blinked and then muttered, "I, uh, just wanted to say 'hi.' I—I've not seen one of you before."\n\n"Hi," Gerhard grunted before returning to his task. "I am heavy machine yak. Guards make this my machine." As he gave a small gesture to it, there was a spark and crackle as something on the control board fizzled, and Gerhard's even demeanor suddenly snapped. Petal flinched back as Gerhard yelled in frustration as he started to repeatedly crack his forehooves on the panel.\n\n"Dumb machine! No work like yak pri—" Before he could finish, half the compound was up in arms, and guards dove onto him to try and weigh him down. As Gerhard flung his assailants off and an alarm rung through the yard, Petal backed away, begging to not be noticed."

Daybreaker was obviously near, as it seemed like the sun was both brighter and more intense than ever before. That, or Pumpkin merely was experiencing another nervous breakdown. Possibly both.\n\nOf course, what was to be expected when she had basically been chosen because she bore a passing resemblance to River Swirl and was distantly related to her? That didn't mean that all the knowledge and skill of her cousin was automatically transferrable!\n\nBiting her lip, she gulped when she spotted the speck in the sky, which within moments grew to a chariot hauled by two soldiers. On it, Daybreaker sat comfortably. She bore a bemused frown.\n\nFor a second, Pumpkin's mind froze when she saw Daybreaker, but she quickly bowed before she was bid to rise. "W-W-Welcome t-to, uh, the, uh—" Pumpkin clamped down on her tongue. Inwardly, she willed her brain to finish the thought, but given how her knees were knocking together, that was unlikely.\n\nDaybreaker snorted. "I believe I understand the sentiment."\n\n"Y-Yes, o-of course, of course," stammered Pumpkin. She clenched her teeth into an uncomfortable smile while Daybreaker merely glared at her. Pulling at her uniform's neck again, she coughed, "Well, uh, I'll lead you back to—"\n\n"Don't bother." Shimmering brightly, Daybreaker's horn lit up and in a burst of light, she, her guards, and Pumpkin were standing in one of the intact squares of [RIV.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Pumpkin squeaked.\n\n"Intact" would have been a nice way to describe it, as there was still rubble littering the streets and multiple buildings were nothing more than blown out, smoking skeletons. At least there was space to walk upon, though!\n\n"Pumpkin Swirl." Pumpkin stiffened when she was named. Slowly looking up at Daybreaker, she grinned awkwardly as the alicorn towered over her. "Tell me, all those bits I provided to 'rebuild my Eastern ponies' city,' where did they go?" She motioned to the buildings. "Where is the work being done to repair this? Where did my architects wander off to?" Her mane flickering a deep shade of blue, she leaned down and hissed, "Should I look at retiring you permanently?"\n\nShaking her head, Pumpkin could only whimper as she pointed behind Daybreaker at an object in the middle of the square. A statue. Although not complete, it was clearly Daybreaker raising a flag in victory.\n\nWhen she saw it, Daybreaker blinked and hummed. "I suppose I underestimated your sycophantism."

  solarreworked.381.d:0 "Ducking low underneath one of the low-hanging beams at a small dock in [649.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s outer harbor, River Swirl brushed back some of her mane. She flicked water from the hoof she had used. At the moment, all she had to do was wait, which she could easily do, along with the five or six other ponies with her, while they waited for the small schooner they had chartered to arrive.\n\nShe swallowed. When she got a shake of the head from one of her fellow, true harmonists, she sighed and went to looking out toward the city. Thus far, they had not been spotted by anypony hostile. Everypony who they had run across had wished them luck or joined them. Still, maintaining caution by limiting contact and remaining hidden was wise.\n\nHer mind still burned like she had seen [619.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s parliament building. In her heart, the ponies that had trusted her deserved her leadership, but she didn't have the army. Not yet.\n\n"When was that ship supposed to arrive?" she heard Cream Stream ask cautiously, and she shook her head.\n\n"They couldn't promise anything exact." River Swirl frowned as she glanced back. "I would agree with that, though. It will make it harder for them to be tied to anything clandestine. We'll be in [NCH.GetNameDef] before you know it, though." As she finished, though, there was soft clanging, and she could see, even from under the dock, that a small ship was approaching. It could easily hold them all. Only a single pony manned the rudder.\n\nFurrowing her brow, River Swirl emerged from underneath the docks, instantly pelted by more rain. She approached the schooner and asked, "Much trouble with the elements?"\n\n"None. Everything is in harmony," the captain stated, and River's growing anxiety left her in an instant. She smiled, her legs slightly wobbly from nerves, and she called for her fellow escapees. It only took a moment for them to scramble on board, and she saw a pained expression on the captain.\n\n"What is it?" she inquired. "Were you followed?"\n\n"Not exactly," he coughed, but before he could say more, the flap to below deck flipped open, and a couple of soldiers, [RCT.GetAdjective] soldiers, trained their guns at the group. River sputtered in shock.\n\nWithin seconds, a familiar, older pony popped his head out, and River exclaimed, "Arclight! What are y—"\n\n"One more mission for the OHS. Thought I'd see to it personally," he interjected. With a shake of his head, he stated, "Just protecting Harmony, River. Something that you never saw eye-to-eye with." He sighed. "Although, tracking you was difficult. Still, ponies are never invisible, especially to the OHS." After momentarily looking at her, a disappointed frown on his face, he finally declared, "It's over, River. The Empress will deal with you later.""

  solarreworked.382.d:0 "Only the glow of Daybreaker's mane illuminated the dank holding cell that she entered. Although there was a single, barred window that was built into the outer wall, it provided no visibility outside, as save for a few points of light in the distance, it was completely black. The gloom of the Diamond Mountain was all-encompassing.\n\nIn her mane's radiance, a single form of a diamond dog lay stretched out along a cot. Despite the dim conditions, the gashes along his arms and back were noticeable, some fresh, some ancient. Daybreaker withheld a tsk. While her jailers had informed her that so far King Diamondshield had yet to cooperate with her requests, she hadn't surmised that he'd be just THAT adamant. Falling to physical harm was so basic. Sometimes amusing, but basic.\n\n"Your Majesty," she jeered with a small bow. It took a few seconds for Diamondshield to make a noise. He hadn't been sleeping, though. From her best guess, it was either purposefully ignoring her, or her negotiators' words had been mulled over until her interruption.\n\nFor a second, Diamondshield didn't move a muscle, but he finally sat up, letting out a couple of soft whines, and turned to face Daybreaker. Initially, his eyes were glazed, in a stupor, but when he saw Daybreaker, they cleared like ice before a flame. He frowned. Shadows played across his muzzle and wrinkles, appearing like canyons etched into rock. With a grunt, he snarled, "I have nothing to say."\n\n"Come now, don't be so boring!" quipped Daybreaker. Lightly scoffing, she motioned derisively with a forehoof and strutted up to him. "I've been told you've been rather obstinate with my ponies. I thought I'd take time out of my day to sort things out." She grinned, a menacing spark in her eye. "I must apologize for how eager they were, though." She glanced again at the wounds. "More talking points around dinner, I suppose."\n\n"Taunt me however you like, pony, but I will not be your pawn and allow you to exploit our wealth! Every dog here would rather die than—"\n\n"Please! Spare me the theatrics!" Daybreaker interjected. Blowing a raspberry, she shook her head and stated, "No, no, no, I will not be so brutish as my negotiators." Bending down to pressing her muzzle against his, she chirped, "I'll simply move on to somedog else. I hope your daughter didn't pick up your stubbornness. Would be rather unenjoyable work, I'm afraid."\n\nDiamondshield's eyes went wide. Recoiling in fear, he bowed his head and stammered, "L-Leave her!

  solarreworked.383.d:0 "The mine's shift horn echoed throughout the tunnels. In unison, hundreds of diamond dogs halted their labor, which had left them bruised, scarred, and bloodied from the day. From the assembled masses, their padded paws patted loudly enough to sound like the drumming of rain, if it could carry through the mountain's rock, hundreds of feet above. Although there was lighting, it was provided only by fading, non-magical bulbs, most of which were threatening to give out within only a couple of more days.\n\nAs of yet, no word on when that would be fixed.\n\nRubbing his stomach as he felt it rumble, Red Gemspike whimpered and whined as his fellow diamond dogs trudged their way back toward the entrance of the mine. Ideally, they'd all get away in short time, and have a moment to crash in a bunk and eat before the next shift. Wouldn't be free from any watching Solarist eyes, though.\n\nThe thought surged through his mind as he watched a couple of patrolling soldiers slow to eye the miners. He scoffed. They called it "required volunteer work" for Daybreaker, but it was easy enough to call it what it was: slavery. No better than Rover Diamondshield had been before things all ended.\n\nWith a small yelp, he practically stumbled into line with a number of other miners who had arrived at the entrance before him. He winced at the smarting pain in his left hind paw and glared at the offending rock that caused it.\n\nAs he rubbed it, he noticed the line remaining orderly—an oddity—and then spotted the lead forepony, or more accurately, slave driver, Ferrous Oxide. The stallion took a moment to check on the miners.\n\nIn a jovial tone, he exclaimed, "Excellent news for you all: you will have more work which you'll be volunteering for!" Collectively groaning, the miners hung their heads and Ferrous frowned. "Shall I also mention that it's performance review time?" That received no response.\n\nRed's stomach lurched. In the back of his head, he tried as best he could to count up the weeks of work that he and his team had accomplished. They hadn't done too bad, he concluded. Hopefully, anyway.\n\nAt the continued silence, Ferrous sneered. "I suppose I'll simply have to congratulate all of you for being hard workers." Where there would have been a sigh of relief, there was only an air of tension. Glancing ahead of Red into another section of the assembled miners, Ferrous added, "Except Gnaw Bonesnapper and her crew. You allowed slothfulness to affect you." He clapped his hooves as some soldiers moved in. "But fear not, you can still be useful. As an example."\n\nRed's blood chilled as half a dozen dogs were dragged away, and put up against a wall. There was a series of retorts before their bodies hit the floor. Afterward, Ferrous glanced up, a question on his lips."

As she brought its bulk between her and her adversaries, a number of bullets ricocheted off the stone, and others whizzed by where she had been only a second before. On her portable radio, she heard one of her other squadmates make a similar bark of her own. She sighed as she counted to ten.\n\nSo much for the element of surprise like they'd hoped. Granted, her unit wasn't far from the main garrison, so they'd have reinforcements in a short while, but intel had put this as one, smaller kirin insurgent encampment. Instead, it was like an outpost, with proper defenses.\n\nGrabbing her radio, she exclaimed, "Where's our ace?!"\n\n"She was busy, last I heard," one of her other squadmates squawked through in response. In the soldier's report's wake, a number of grumbles and groans emanated from her unit.\n\n"Better not have gotten carried away with songwriting again," a third voice hissed as bullets pinged and retorted off of wherever they had found cover.\n\nBefore Silver could add anything further to the grumbling, she screamed and went prone, firing twice into the kirin who had charged around the corner of her protection. The kirin jolted a couple of times from the bullet impacts, then stumbled past her, revealing the bayonet that he had tried to impale her with.\n\nFurther off to her west, through the scattered trees of the somewhat woodland area they were in, she heard a number of gunshots, as well as an explosion. Daring to lift her head, she caught the last remnants of a frag grenade blast peppering the ground, leaving behind bits and pieces of a couple of enemy troops.\n\nFor a brief moment, her heart returned to a somewhat normal rate, rather than the intense thrashing against her chest from moments prior. Yet as she caught her breath and readied to fire back at here section of the camp, there was a blindingly blue burst of light in the enemy position, and she gulped. Legs going limp, she spotted a single, charred black nirik zoom out of the encampment toward the heaviest part of the attack.\n\nBefore it could reach much further, though, there was another, animalistic howl, and a second nirik galloped out of the trees, leaving behind smoldering plants that soon ignited. As smoke rose, the two niriks collided, splattering flames in all directions.\n\nFor a brief moment, the firefight slowed as the two creatures circled and punched at each other. Whenever they did connect, a spray of fire leapt from it. Silver's eyes went wide. It was never short of fear-inducing seeing such an embodiment of the Empress's own power in a creature.\n\nBefore she could ponder much longer on it, though, the gunshots carried on from her comrades, and she caught on the radio an order to burn the entire outpost to the ground."

He was sure of it.\n\nThose thoughts repeated in Blueblood's mind as he poured over various manuscripts and tomes that had been acquired—not looted, like some of the inhabitants liked to claim—from [KIR.GetNameDef]. Despite their ostentatious nature as pacifism, that didn't stop the kirin from having a large collection of details on warfare, just like any other species on the planet. Even ponies had their own libraries and colleges of war, as much as the vaunted thousand years of relative peace before Luna's return had led to a slow military decline.\n\nHowever, with the integration of the kirin within [ROOT.GetNameDef], an opportunity to adopt or mold tactics based on their own hundreds of years of experience was not to be passed up. While, yes, his auntie was busy with the new minds who had helped end the limp-fetlocked state after the Silence, studying the old materials of the greatest kirin war masters had its benefit, too.\n\nHe blinked again at the pages before him.\n\nIf he could understand them, that was.\n\nAlready, his offices were shrouded in darkness like a veil, with only a dim lamp on his desk providing aid to his own light spell. Blearily shaking his head, he read aloud the current page that was causing his brain to desire the sweet embrace of being clocked by a steel beam. With a huff, he muttered, "'The victorious warrior knows herself before battle. The defeated warrior knows her enemy before herself.'" He snorted. Rubbing his forehead, he groaned as his headache worsened.\n\nIt made sense. Mostly. Taken as a couple of proverbs at a time, it would have been bearable, but so far the entire collection had been nothing but in that vein. As Blueblood looked up to peer out his office window at the dark skyline of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], he shuddered. After sending one more look at the pile of books and scripts, he swallowed uncomfortably.\n\nHe tapped a hoof on the desk, then got up. Feeling his bones crack, he grunted and quickly redressed in his uniform. That was probably about as much as he could realistically absorb in a day. If any of that even stuck, it'd be a miracle. With one final glance back, he reread one page, which spoke of breaking enemy walls through removing one's own, and he whinnied.\n\nThrowing it back on the pile, he stomped out.

As she was, they too also carried disgusted frowns on their faces as the griffon protested.\n\nScratching her forehead and staring out at the sunlight as it peeked over the buildings in Griffenheim and cast long shadows through the streets. Puddles from the rain the night before still provided plenty of dampness for the light to reflect off of, creating a crystal-like surface that sparkled and dazzled any that would have watched. However, she switched her attention back to the furious noble, Fritz, if she recalled correctly, and she quipped, "Yes, bird. It is MY palace, is it not?"\n\n"Verdammt Ponys! Wissen sie, dass sie hier nur—" Before he could get much further, though, Daybreaker lit her horn, and he squeaked. Eyeing the magic field that had coalesced around it, he whimpered and took a couple of steps back.\n\n"Ponish, bitte," Daybreaker hissed back. "Willst du meinen Zorn fuhlen?" At that, Daybreaker fed a bit more magic into her horn, and it sparked a couple of times. When the noble held up his claws, she stood back. "Good. Now, rather than introduce yourself with a tantrum a foal would be embarrassed by, perhaps use adult words?"\n\nSullenly, the griffon switched his gaze between Daybreaker and the number of ponies in her wake, and he snarled, "You have brought more of THEM into our palace. The gods will not take kindly upon sullying Grover's legacy further!" At that, Daybreaker scoffed and rolled her eyes.\n\n"Please. Fritz, correct?" He nodded. With a snort, Daybreaker mockingly patted him on the head. "Fritz, these ponies are here to help keep the Empire stronger, much like mine." She clicked her tongue. "Do you not agree that it could have been administered better?" When he finally nodded and glanced away, she smirked. "Of course, because it could have. They are here to do that."\n\nAs they were mentioned, one of the ponies, a smartly-dressed mare, approached Daybreaker and muttered, "We do have a schedule to keep, Empress."\n\n"Yes, of course, but I believe that you're replacing Fritz anyway," Daybreaker replied, which made Fritz jerk up with a screech. At his dumbfounded look, Daybreaker added, "Please. Did you think that I'd keep a griffon comptroller when there was millions of bits at stake? You'd likely come up with a way to pilfer it all and flee if you could." As Fritz went beet red at the statement, she added, "Or am I wrong?"\n\nHis silence was deafening."

Breathing in, she flexed her wings and heard hooves approach from behind her. With a long sigh, she turned. After the rather tepid defense that the Saddle Arabian government put up, it was only appropriate she tour her new territory's capital.\n\nIn the attempts by Saddle Arabia, their armies had sacked sections of the city which had been the most developed. Probably to avoid having the riches of the oil-rich country falling into their foes. It mattered little. She would have it regardless.\n\nBreaking from her reverie, she smirked as a pair of soldiers, who were dragging a red horse, who, despite being rather disheveled, was recognizably the Grand Prince Faisal. Despite only meeting once, she couldn't mistake his mane anywhere. Nor his demeanor.\n\nThe soldiers released him and he fell to the ground. She scoffed. "Get up," she ordered tersely. "The LEAST you could do is thank me for your release."\n\n"H-Hey," Faisal murmured as he pushed himself up. Although shaken and dirtied, from whichever prison that he had been locked in before her conquest of the peninsula, he still managed to flash her a cocky grin. "T-Thanks, mare. You don't know—"\n\n"EMPRESS." Bristling, Daybreaker bared her teeth and her mane thrashed wildly. Stomping toward him, she noted that his escorts stepped further back, recognizing her fury. Faisal, for his part, stood his ground, although it could have been because he was too simple-minded to comprehend his impending danger.\n\n"Woah, like, is that what I should call you in—" Before he could finish, Daybreaker's horn ignited in a flash of red and his coughed. Eyes bulging slightly, he grappled at his throat with a hoof, and he started gagging. Daybreaker sneered.\n\n"Silence. I like it." Sniffing, she released him and he wheezed as hacked as air rushed back into his lungs. With a tsk, Daybreaker stated, "I did not release you for you to make advances." She stalked toward him. As she got within inches of his muzzle, she glared, her eyes flashing with rage. "I am giving you a chance. Saddle Arabia is now mine, and you can either do as I say, and oversee my new citizens, or I will somepony else who can."\n\nShe arched a brow. "Do you understand me, foal?"\n\nFaisal simply gawked for a second or two, then he started to prostrate himself. "Y-Yes, oh sizzling Empress," he declared. Before she could retort, he hugged her forehooves. Then started thanking her ad nauseam."

  solarreworked.390.d:0 "Scrambling over a couple of rocks, Hoffra panted and nearly stumbled forward into the descent on the other side of the climb. However, he managed to keep his balance and only had to watch as a few stones tumbled about thirty feet below to the ground of the forest. He gulped. His knees felt like rubber. Yet stopping was not an option, at least not quite yet.\n\nAfter taking only a couple of gasps, he weakly wove his way through the cracks in the large boulders that made up one of the juts of rock around [MTA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Much of the city was built into the mountain itself, but there were at least some portions of the settlement outside the archive itself, which allowed for an easier escape.\n\nAnd easy was needed.\n\nAs he finally reached the bottom, he looked around him and strained to listen. Aside from the odd bird chirping away or the crinkle of leaves from one of the wild animals stepping on one, there was no noise. An infrequent wind lightly puffed against his muzzle as he sat down, drenched in sweat and lightly frothing at the mouth. His lanky legs practically gave out once he stopped moving, but he managed to stay propped up.\n\nFor years he'd worked with [MTA.GetLeader] and now everything was abandoned by an agreement with that insane fire alicorn! Everyhorse was supposed to guard those artifacts in the Mountain with their lives, not just turn them over to a tyrant in exchange for more, shared between them.\n\nAs the thought crossed his mind, he scrutinized a tree in front of him. He swore that he had seen something ruffling near there, but it was probably his exhausted body beginning to play tricks on him. Despite the sweat and his aching lungs, he started to shiver. Drawing his archivist's cowl closer to him, he glanced around and then dipped a hoof into his robe. With a sigh, he felt the shape in his cloak's pocket.\n\nAfter a second or two, he pulled it out. In the daylight, it caught a golden glimmer from the sun, even if its body itself was purest silver. If the research was right on what this was, it'd be a mistake to let Daybreaker come anywhere close to accessing it. Supposedly the device ancient ponies used to create something akin to alicorns. If it could supercharge her then—\n\nBefore he could finish his thought, there was a crackle from the artifact, and then he gulped when a couple of pops of magic sounded from either side of him, and he was tackled to the ground. All he got was one look at the two unicorns who had apprehended him, then one pointing a pistol at him.\n\n"For stealing from the Empress," the unicorn huffed. Hoffra's world went black before he could register the gunshot crack."

  solarreworked.391.d:0 "It was such an assuming little cavern, was the only thought that was going through Daybreaker's head as she and an entire division of soldiers of the Militarium stood outside the heart of [MTA.GetNameDef]. As they called it, "The Cave."\n\nFor hundreds of years, mages sought, divined, and fought for magical artifacts, new and old, that contained exceeding power. Not even she knew what the hold of treasure contained, although she could take a pass at a guess or two. Although not many within her regime knew, the mages had attempted to steal the Elements of Harmony in the past.\n\n"Auntie, everypony is prepared," Blueblood stated as he marched up and bowed to Daybreaker. "Shall I order a barrage first?"\n\nShe waved a hoof dismissively. "It is only a few dozen mages," she proclaimed confidently. "Can they hope to stand against a legion of my faithful ponies?"\n\nBefore Blueblood could answer, there was a loud pop and puff of smoke, as a small piece of parchment fell in front of Daybreaker. It contained only a single statement. "If you are so powerful, perhaps we shall determine it pony to pony?" It was signed by [MTA.GetLeader].\n\n"Ha!" Daybreaker chortled. "[MTA.GetLeader.GetHeShe] believes that I can be beaten?"\n\n"Auntie..."\n\n"Enough, Blueblood, I'll deal with that mage slime myself!" In a swirl of fire, she teleported herself to the entrance, where [MTA.GetLeader] was already waiting.\n\n"You are not the coward believed," [MTA.GetLeader.GetSheHe] stated calmly. Daybreaker scowled. "I am alone. If you can best me, there is clearly no hope for us against your army."\n\nScoffing, Daybreaker splayed her forehooves and snarled, "Prepare yourself, foal. Your fate has already been sealed." With a quick windup, she fired a beam of flame at [MTA.GetLeader], but without flinching, [MTA.GetLeader.GetSheHe] flicked it away with a bit of magic.\n\nShe frowned, and barely dodged a spike that zoomed up from the ground toward her stomach. Immediately, her heart leapt into her throat, and she watched [MTA.GetLeader.GetHerHim] with trepidation. She didn't get much chance, as a spear of ice formed inches from her face, and she teleported to avoid its stab.\n\nRe-emerging about a foot away from [MTA.GetLeader.GetHerHim], she felt a large stone underneath a hoof. An idea grabbed her. She snatched stone in hoof, hurled it, and managed to connect with [MTA.GetLeader.GetHerHis] forehead. In the one instant she had, she screamed and sprang. Normally it was frowned upon for a magic user to user their horn for physical combat, but she lunged all the same, penetrating his chest with a soft squish.\n\n[MTA.GetLeader] gagged, and gawked at her. Wordlessly, [MTA.GetLeader.GetSheHe] fell back, dead. She gazed for a second, then breyed excitedly.\n\nThey were in."

Revulsion practically sprinted through Inquisitor Pulsar Beam at the thought as she listened to the sounds of the chaos around her. Buildings burned. Smoke soared. Fires fanned. What was once a surviving—calling any settlements within the damned country of [BAT.GetNameDef] prosperous was too kind—town now filled her nostrils with the scent of soot.\n\nThat, however, was not the concern she had. What was a bit of the Empress's Holy Flame to her? Rather, it was sharing the very air that had to be shared with the animals, the thestrals, that churned her stomach.\n\nThe day was still strong, with the Empress's Sun barely leaving its high noon peak. Despite it, the flames in the town flickered and cast some orange on nearby, darker walls. She had broken off from the rest of her division's command. After all, they could handle themselves. Merely observing the carnage at this point was satisfactory, as she would have to oversee that the soldiers did what was required.\n\nAlready, of the cowards that hadn't fled to the sky when the first gunshots retorted in the settlement, a portion of them were bound in the square, one of the only places not consumed in an inferno. A few of her troops doused some fires with water magic, to keep a path open for faithful to bring more prisoners back. In the group in the center of the square, the thestrals, they were huddled together, watching the guards with a mix of fear or fury. Pulsar held her gaze with one younger mare and she scowled.\n\nBrushing back some of her neon blue mane, Pulsar trotted across the block she had been observing from and gave a curt nod to the captain in charge of the unit. "Should be under control soon, Inquisitor," he informed her after showing a couple of maps of the town.\n\nShe hummed. "Good, Captain. Now, if you don't mind, I think we should get started."\n\nAs he blinked at her for a moment, he exclaimed, "Oh, yes, of course. I'll let my troops know." She departed while he split from her, and she went to stand in front of the crowd of thestrals. With a smirk, she scratched at one of her scars along her neck, and she proclaimed, "Soon you'll have the corruption you've shouldered be freed, fallen ponies." Her mouth twisted into a sneer. "May the Empress's Holy Flame purify you!"\n\nAt her cue, a pair of soldiers with small flamethrowers approached, and in unison with her, created a torrent of fire. She barely reacted to the screams in the square."

Of course, pacify meant more than simply maintaining peace. From the soot that littered the pavement and the smoke that slowly belched into the sky, anypony passing within two hundred miles could tell what was going on.\n\nWhen they had entered, there had been a touch of confusion, then the first bullets started flying, but not from one of the company troops. He'd felt the blood splatter against his helmet when a couple more gunshots had rung out from some buildings near the square of this town. Afterward, it was a tad blurry, given that he had run from building to building, staying in cover and shooting at those he could see.\n\nIn the first moments of the skirmish, a number of ponies, thestrals, of the town took flight, retreating toward the horizon. Although he had caught his commander curse, there were no pegasi in the company to pursue, and they were left with those dimwitted enough to stay. Still, with such a tepid answer to an arriving army, the fight hadn't lasted long.\n\n"Lieutenant Stern?" another stallion asked, and Stern stiffened. Lowering his head from staring at the sky, he saluted the company commander, Buzz Cut. Cut snorted. As another series of shots rang out from nearby,within fifty feet, Cut inquired, "Thinking, Lieutenant?"\n\nStern affirmed as much, and Cut huffed, "Don't. Follow me." With a gulp, Stern obeyed and they soon arrived at the square. Dozens of thestrals were lined up, and Stern felt his stomach churn, both at them, and perhaps a bit at what was going to happen.\n\nUnlike the rest of the town, the square had been mostly untouched, save some pieces of rubble from the houses further outside that had been demolished. Ashes and soot rained down from the conflagrations that raged on beyond the safety of the square. Through the smoke, the Empress's sunlight appeared bloody, which sent a shiver down his spine.\n\nCut stated, "They've been found guilty. I'll leave you to it. Have to deal with the other front." At that, he nodded again at Stern, and departed. Stern swallowed and watched as one stallion, barely an adult, whimpered and looked right into his soul. With a shiver, Stern shook his head and he glanced at the soldiers in the square.\n\n"You heard the Commander! Take aim!" Switching back to the assembled thestrals, he stared at the same stallion again and bellowed, "Fire!""

Although it was still barely noon in Zebrica, the smoke that still rose from the damnable thestrals' houses blotted out much of the light that the Empress's sun provided. When she gently landed on the makeshift pad, she was instantly greeted by one of the Militarium's officers, who saluted and stood, sweat dribbling down his face.\n\nShe narrowed her eyes at him. Nothing to indicate fault or guilt. Perfectly normal fear response to her arrival. She could carry on.\n\nWithout a word, she strode past him and then asked, "You know why I'm here?"\n\n"O-Of course, Lady Inquisitor," the stallion stammered while keeping pace with her. Both of their hooves crunched and cracked on shattered stones and pieces of cement. Much of [712.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] lay in various states of ruin, especially the grand temple dedicated to Nightmare Moon. Even its now skeletal appearance, which still towered over everything else, left Sunrise's stomach churning.\n\nAs they passed a couple of structures in the midst of repair by the new, indebted workers of the city, Sunrise huffed, "Then they've already been prepared for my, and by extension, the Empress's judgement?" When she received a nod, she smiled without any hint of emotion, "Great. That'll at least save time so I can get back to more important things. Like if thestrals are really as perceptive as they claim to be by blasting them with sonic magic nopony else could hear." She hummed. "So far, mixed results."\n\nOnly a couple minutes passed while they meandered toward the prison that had been established in the old palace where [BAT.GetLeader] and [BAT.GetLeader.GetHerHis] cronies had ruled. Stepping hoof inside of it, Sunrise bristled her fur and defensively lit her horn. There was no threat, though, as the expansive premises were patrolled and every thestral she saw there was bound with at least three sets of chains.\n\nWith a small smirk, she allowed herself to be led to where her court case would be. Not that there'd be any trial. They'd already been found guilty. When she arrived in an open plaza near the main atrium, she saw that [BAT.GetLeader] was there, along with the rest of the corrupt leadership. They all bore their fangs as she grew nearer.\n\nStaring them all in the eyes, she declared, "For crimes of the highest degree against Harmony and against the Empress, you've been found worthy of one fate. There will be no repeals, no pleas for mercy." In the dead silence that followed, she interjected, "Not that I'd expect you to." As she used her magic to snag a gun from one of the soldiers waiting in the plaza, she took aim at [BAT.GetLeader]. "Before you all go, though, would you like to fill a questionnaire on what you believe your eternal punishment will be?""

It wasn't like he agreed to his auntie's request to travel ALL the way to the backward and suffocating continent of Zebrica, let alone to whatever filth the [BAT.GetAdjective] had in [712.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to be ignored. True, he wasn't exactly forgotten, as he had his retinue with him, but to think at least one guard in the entire prison, which he had helped organize, didn't recognize him, was just a tad insulting.\n\nAs seconds ticked by, Blueblood's fury that had risen in his chest reached a boiling point and he finally snapped, "Where is the warden?!" At that, everypony in the repurposed palace used by [BAT.GetLeader] froze. Even the prisoners that were out. It was quiet enough a pin could be heard dropping.\n\nSomepony coughed. Then, a few seconds later, one of the doors in the main atrium opened and a mare carefully trotted out. Red plastered her face as she shuffled along, then gave a limp salute to Blueblood. "Apologies, Lord Commander," she nickered, "but rounding up and keeping the prisoners organized takes much—"\n\n"Enough excuses!" Blueblood interrupted with a stomp of a hoof. Jabbing another at her, he barked, "You! Name! Location of [BAT.GetLeader]! Now!"\n\nFlinching back at Blueblood's outburst, the mare stammered, "Major Earmark, Lord Commander! [BAT.GetLeader] is in block seven B. I-I'm sorry, but we didn't expect you until—"\n\nBlueblood smirked. "Surprise is a weapon, Major Earmark. A chief element, wouldn't you agree?"\n\n"Well, fear and surprise, I'd say, Lord Commander."\n\nFurrowing his brow, Blueblood snarled, "Yes, and ruthless efficiency, especially against those who mock the Empress's appointed, right, CAPTAIN?" When Earmark bit her lip and nodded, Blueblood huffed with a self-satisfied grin. "Excellent. Then I suggest you gather those fools in seven B. They have wondrous news to experience." With a glimmer in his eye, he tittered, "Very inspiring to one, anyway."\n\n"A surprise, Lord Commander?" Earmark asked, although she ducked back when Blueblood focused his ire on her again. With a placating bow, she turned to head to the cell blocks, but asked, "Why are they needed, Lord Commander?"\n\nWith a dismissive snort, he answered, "Oh, Auntie's made her final judgement on them all. I'm here to merely lay out it." He pulled out a pistol from a holster inside his uniform and inspected it. "Do you think one or two bullets to each bat's head will suffice, Lieutenant?"\n\nSwallowing, Earmark mumbled, "I'll just get them while you think.""

To heal the land on Zebrica and provide a new home for ponies, the taint of Nightmare Moon and the Moonspeakers will be thoroughly and completely cleansed from the land.\n\nBeginning this morning, troops marched their way into Batsby, the first of the settlements to face the Empress's judgement, and there has been nothing left save a few buildings for the new residents to use for shelter. Where there was once a town has now been turned into a field of ash. Ursagrad burned for almost twenty hours, with the entire time occupied for soldiers in rounding up and taking care of the thestrals that did not flee to free nations nearby.\n\nIn the peninsula, the coven where the Moonspeakers resided was stormed by force, and the invading troops thoroughly filtered through every street, nook, and cranny to capture the offending Nightmare worshipers. Although some of the regions of the settlement have been left untouched, the city itself has been nearly wiped off the map. Smoke from its burning and the other burnings will likely reach halfway across Zebrica by the time the cleaning of [BAT.GetNameDef] is complete.\n\nFirstport was quickly stormed by land and sea and taken unscathed. Thousands of thestrals have already been hurried to their ends. Only [712.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] was a trouble point, as the city was so expansive and contained overwhelming numbers of thestrals. One of the first monuments to go was the temple to Nightmare Moon. Much of its rubble fuels the fires for clearing the streets of bodies. Like the Moonspeaker coven, its smoke will most certainly stretch across much of the continent.\n\nHowever, [BAT.GetNameDef] has been pacified. Its offense to the Empress and Harmony no longer will be remembered.\n\nThe idea of a thestral state, or a thestral on Zebrica at all, will only be a distant memory."

Of course, that one, unsurprisingly, was on fire. In fact, it already had reached a critical mass to the point of reaching higher than most buildings within the square outside the library.\n\nIt hadn't been like she didn't consider arguing against the mob to not burn the knowledge. After all, it was a thousand years of information from the greatest minds that Nightmare Moon had given [BAT.GetNameDef], even a few words of wisdom from the Nightmare herself. To throw all of that out the window simply because it was not something that that petulant fire-breather, Daybreaker, had written was rather absurd.\n\nOf course, what was also absurd was getting killed while there were still opportunities to further research how ponies ticked. That was one of the only reasons she was able to scrape by and not be burnt at the stake like the rest of her fellow council members. A small play to insanity, a bit of exaggeration about being forced to go along with acts, and then the stage was set for "enlightenment," as they called it.\n\nFrowning, Emerald stepped aside as a dozen foals charged forward and each dumped a book onto the pyre in front of her. In the night sky, the orange blaze cast what appeared like lava on the buildings around the square. Emerald gently cleaned her glasses. When she reapplied them with a hoof, she pulled back as she felt a small wetness on it.\n\nShe arched an eyebrow. Tears?\n\nYes, there were a couple. While she had her research to return to—testing the flexibility of a pony's body when put under extreme duress could have important impacts to new fighter chassis, after all—there would not be more knowledge she could find at a moment's notice.\n\nNightmare Moon. Daybreaker. The name of the alicorn didn't matter. If they allowed her to play her games, then it was enough.\n\nAs a small bit of bile built her stomach at seeing another batch books being tossed, she whirled around around. It was like daylight, even in the dead of night, with the flames. She watched her flickering shadow on the walls behind her momentarily. With a resigned sigh, she glanced back at the pyre, furrowed her brow, and left.\n\nThere was nothing left of the Nightmare now. Only the day pressed on."

With one final wink of light, the sun, her sun, her essence, dipped below the horizon, leaving the sky a wash of purples, pinks, and oranges. Down below, in the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the shouts of joy and harmonious singing that had graced her for the entire day still persisted.\n\nFor once, there was no war to direct. There were no threats to her Harmony, to her ponies. In the days since the collapse of the last cells of resistance, a great ceremony had been organized. Upon raising the sun for the day of ponykind's unification, services had run the entire length, as ponies prostrated themselves before her as she displayed her power, her deity.\n\nAs she approached her chamber's balcony, she paused and looked to the sky. Although a sliver, the thin shape of the moon was discernible. She chuckled. Her mane slowly crackled and popped as its shade deepened into a dark red. Sauntering out onto the balcony itself, she sighed and cast her gaze over [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Still the high of constant adoration left her mind hazy with endorphins. Yet she tapped a hoof.\n\nWhat was she to do, now that all of ponykind bowed to her? How could she display her glory, her superiority, without a goal to strive toward?\n\nShaking her head, she simply watched as the night grew and ponies started to wander from the various activities that had been set up around the palace as well as the courtyards throughout the city. Inquisitors, ensuring the faithful remained pure, detained a couple leaving before taking them away to be questioned. Towering spires attempted to touch the heavens across [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], yet none could reach the celestial beacon that she commanded.\n\nAs a hymn drifted up to her ears, her heart fluttered again and she giggled. "What would you say to me now, sister?" she inquired aloud. "Am I a madmare simply for achieving my destiny?" Looking up to the moon, a coy sneer formed on her lips and she shook her head. She pushed back, and then turned to head to her bed.\n\nBy now, the sun's light was only a tinge of pink along the fringes of the horizon, and the stars had slipped out from their veil of darkness to twinkle brightly. With one final chorus, the last of the festivities as she stared, and the night grew silent, save the hubbub of departing faithful.\n\nDaybreaker grinned. Tomorrow was a new day.\n\nHer Sun would be waiting."
  solarreworked.399.d_b:0 "Her chest swelling with pride, Daybreaker strode down the hallways of the Imperial Palace. For once, she could do so without guards, without ponies genuflecting and waiting to throw themselves in front of her path to protect her. Instead, she could simply close her eyes and let the warmth of her Sun sink into her fur. She sighed.\n\nAside from the servants who moved about like busy ants in the apparatus of her palace, nopony dared get near her. Even the servants wordlessly bowed their heads and muttered words of praise to her.\n\n"You have won, Empress." "How can we hope to thank you, Empress?" "Please visit my son sometime, Empress. He wishes to learn from you one day." "Bless my foal, Empress!"\n\nWith each passing comment, Daybreaker's smirk grew ever wider and her canter grew more confident and cocky. After sauntering a couple more hallways, she grinned at the section lined with busts of her, portraits of her, and stained glass depictions of her, as a passageway of honor for her great deeds. At the far end, near the entrance to the throne room, a pony was hastily putting the finishing touches on a new map installation of the world.\n\nWhen he saw Daybreaker after putting the finishing touches on the map with his magic, he squeaked in surprise, bowed, and quickly departed before she could speak to him. Daybreaker merely rolled her eyes as she heard him scuffle away into some corner of the palace.\n\nFocusing her attention onto the map, she felt her mane whip excitedly as she visually traced the new borders. From the northern reaches of Equus to Griffonia to the Western half of Zebrica, [ROOT.GetNameDef] stretched across the planet. She closed her eyes. In her mind's eye, she visualized ponies, some going about their days, others just waking, touched by her Sun. In turn, they gave thanks for their protection and they obeyed whatever she desired.\n\nNo matter where they went, her likeness would be on a building, posters, or installations of art.\n\nTracing her hoof along the golden threads symbolizing her domain, she chuckled. Where were the naysayers against her now? Where were the threats to her Harmony and to her Order?\n\nPerhaps some would say that she was the greatest pony to grace the world. They'd be right.\n\nAs she turned from the map, she gazed at one of the stained glass windows. Sneering at the scene of her banishing Luna to the deepest dungeons, she stated, "I realized my potential, sister. Such a shame you could never do the same with yours." She gave a mocking wave and declared, "Ta! Harmony waits for nopony!""
  solarreworked.399.d_c:0 "The cell was dark, save for the orange glow of Daybreaker's mane as she stepped into it. Scraping shut, the chamber door echoed through the otherwise empty detention block of the Imperial Palace. Outside, faintly audible through the small window looking into [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], cheers, laughter, and music could be heard carrying through the night. Although faint, there were a few blinking stars that could be discerned, which Daybreaker briefly squinted at.\n\nShe sighed and sat down. Despite the revelry in the city, the cell itself was eerily quiet. Dampness leeched into her fur. A shiver ran down her back.\n\nHer ponies were safe. With the last of the threats to her ponies—across the continents—there was only one thing that was appropriate. Celebration. Harmony had been preserved. Order was achieved.\n\nYet there was more.\n\n"Hello, Luna," Daybreaker finally stated, breaking the suffocating silence. Although there were no additional lights within the cell, she simply focused her magic and forced her mane to glimmer brighter. In response, the darkness receded, retreating to the corners of the cell and flickering as her flowing mane rippled and wavered. Resting on a cot in the middle of the far wall, Princess Luna merely stared at her.\n\nDirtied and bruised, she held her glare harshly and remained silent. The only sign that she was alive was that she was breathing. Through all her candor, Daybreaker still managed to wince at Luna's glower. In spite of Luna's disheveled appearance, she appeared acceptably healthy.\n\nDaybreaker sighed. "Harmony has been saved. I've done what was needed of me." Luna remained tight-lipped.\n\nMoving slightly closer, Daybreaker added, "Ponykind has been united, for the first time generations! Everypony is safe. Our ponies—"\n\n"Your ponies, demon," Luna spat. Her mane swirled and whipped frantically. Tiredly whinnying, she shifted in her cot and grunted, "You have come. Why? To mock me? To gloat?"\n\n"I came," retorted Daybreaker, her voice momentarily slipping into a harsh snarl, "to tell you that everypony is now safe." At Luna's furrowed brow, she stated, "I followed my true calling. Peace in my empire is—"\n\n"Ah, and that is where your true nature comes out, devil," Luna interrupted with a nicker. Stomping her hoof once on her cot, she grumbled, "You ultimately care not about ponies, but you care about looking the savior." She narrowed her eyes. "How much have MY ponies suffered because of you? Have you seen what your harsh measures have wrought?"\n\nDaybreaker licked her lips. "Perhaps, but they have bettered my—our—"\n\n"And you still justify them," Luna replied cryptically. She flexed her wings. "I have nothing more to say to you, Daybreaker. Enjoy your empire. You have won."\n\nAs Daybreaker stared at Luna, who simply turned away to stare out the window, she gulped.\n\nShe had won an empire.\n\nShe had lost a sister."

Throughout the streets, small cracks of light in some houses indicated their occupants were still awake, doing their best to remain unnoticeable from any searching for violators of night curfew.\n\nHowever, although Daybreaker occasionally spotted one of her ponies through their windows, she didn't act on it. A couple even noticed her and quickly did what they could to act as if they had gotten up for some reason or another. It only made her smirk.\n\nWhen one hastily shut their blinds, the grin turned sour, and she trotted along, without guard or escort. What was the point of having one? The last pockets of resistance in her overseas territories had been extinguished, and the Empire finally knew peace, which had been celebrated that day and evening. All ponykind now bowed to her, their Empress, and were warded from danger. Yet an electric energy tingled through her veins, and every inch of her itched to get out. See her Empire.\n\nHow long had it been since she had done one of these strolls? Pondering deeply, she still couldn't recall. The one thing that she observed, though, was simply how quiet the streets were at night. With every slow step she took, she could hear the impact of her hoof landing on the cobblestone echo across whatever street she traipsed along.\n\nFinally stopping beside a small business, or at least what used to be one, she stared at her reflection for a moment. Her ponies were safe. Harmony was secured. Ponies followed her. But the expression that was on the one pony she locked gazes with said it all. There was still fear. Fear of her.\n\nAcross her entire Empire, from Equus to Zebrica and Griffonia, these laws had been implemented. Consistency. Order. All for the benefit of her ponies, and, tangentially, any other species within her borders. As she traced a hoof along the glass of the closed shop, she licked her lips. A faded sign stating the owner was shut down due to suspicious activity bore the seal of the Empire. Her seal.\n\nBriefly, her mane dimmed to a dull red, and she asked aloud, "Did I not I follow my calling? I protected my ponies. I saved Harmony!" Looking out from the shop, she spotted a couple more houses blink out their lights, and heard the deathly stillness that permeated the city.\n\nWho was there to thank her?\n\nShe swallowed and moved on. She had won an empire.\n\nShe had lost a people."

  ###EQC and PCB Events###
  solarreworked.400.t:0 "Island of Ignorance"
  solarreworked.400.d:0 "Of the two dominions that we had before the Empress ascended, Puerto Caballo is closer but far less significant. In recent times, there has been a marked amount of turmoil on the small island, as there was an armed revolution against the previous so-called president, who had usurped power and ruled as an autocrat. Yet despite their isolation and their minimal influence, [PCB.GetLeader] believed it wise to abandon Harmony when it needed any assistance at it could get.\n\nPerhaps there are delusions of grandeur as a beacon of freedom in the Canterbbean, but they must surely realize that they made a grave error by rejecting the Empress. There is still much corruption on the island, and the taint of communism twists it from within, even as the vile ideology's local leader rots in jail.\n\nThe Empress is not without mercy, however, and we shall extend a single offer to return to [ROOT.GetFaction] or face the consequences."
  solarreworked.400.a:0 "They would be foals to refuse me!"
  solarreworked.401.t:0 "Tropical Demands"
  solarreworked.401.d:0 "[PCB.GetLeader]'s blood ran cold as he gazed at the official telegram that had arrived in [PCB.GetNameDef]'s capital today, through the previously rarely used lines connected to Canterlot. Everypony had left his quarters, after he had asked them to do as much, and he swallowed as he continued to gaze fearfully at the paper, like it had teeth with which to bite off his head.\n\nWith a groan, he ran both his forehooves through his mane, and leaned forward onto the table that was in the meeting room. Interruption in any gathering of his cabinet was bad enough, but this news...\n\nHe shook his head. His heart thrashed against his chest. Was this what leadership was always going to be like? When he agreed for guidance from Canterlot and Celestia, it was with the expectation of eventual, complete autonomy. As they were isolated, it wasn't like they'd be a target after their dominion status was rescinded. Now, though, what choice could he make?\n\nThe words in the telegram haunted him. Although few, they effectively taunted him, demanding that he choose between his word and his citizens' safety. There were only two lines on the telegram: "Message from Daybreaker, Empress of All. Remember your fealty or perish."\n\nAs his stomach lurched more at those words, he glanced out the window of the meeting room and sighed. The taste of freedom was so short, and his citizens were none the wiser of the threat that had just been delivered. He swallowed. There was only one course of action he could take."
  solarreworked.401.a:0 "What can a tiny island like us do against her?"
  solarreworked.401.b:0 "She has bigger fish to fry. It's safe to ignore her."
  solarreworked.402.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader]'s Gambit"
  solarreworked.402.d_a:0 "Today, a telegram has been received from [FROM.GetNameDef] with an official response from [FROM.GetLeader]. The initial delay in replying to our own demands left some of the Empress's advisors concerned it was ignored, but those fears seem to have been for nothing. In his response message, which took up the majority of the telegram, [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to acquiesce to Daybreaker's humble request, and [FROM.GetNameDef] will pledge itself to defense of Harmony and Order.\n\nCommunication has been quickly set up with [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and [FROM.GetNameDef] to facilitate a smooth transition back under Imperial control. Unlike last time, they will not have nearly as much freedom in deciding internal policy. There must be a unified voice in all the Empress's domains, and this current governmental arrangement is temporary until somepony can be appointed to lead the island in Order properly."
  solarreworked.402.d_b:0 "Shortly before the Empress was to attend a military strategy meeting, a telegram from [FROM.GetLeader] arrived with an official response. Without mincing words, he has rejected the Empress's request, and denounced her as a corruption of everything that he once loved about Equestria.\n\nWhile it is a quaint sentiment, it is utterly meaningless. Although [FROM.GetNameDef] is a small island with only about a million ponies on it, it is still part of the Empress's realm. Its secession shortly after she ascended was dangerous to the survival of Harmony and the betrayal will not be taken lightly. This further insult from such a small nation only furthers the need to rein in their autonomy. This, obviously, must now be by force."
  solarreworked.402.a:0 "Excellent news! More brought back into the fold!"

  solarreworked.403.t:0 "Warm Visits"
  solarreworked.403.d:0 "Tapping his hooves nervously against his desk, Ponse Cocktail stared defiantly at the speech that was waiting for his approval. It had already been penned up by his secretary, but every time he tried to reach out to stamp it, he withdrew it. How could he speak to his ponies and tell them that the hope of reform had died? All those promises that he had given, now they were less than nothing.\n\nWith a sigh, he stared out the window of his villa and licked his lips. From the ocean, a warm breeze brushed against his muzzle and he slicked back his mane. He glared again at the paper, and then hung his head. Reciting the speech, acknowledging Daybreaker... it was significant to admit. Maybe if he just slipped into a trash bin by "accident," he could—\n\nBefore he could finish his thoughts, there was a knock on his door, and his secretary popped her head in and stated, "Governor, there are ponies from [ROOT.GetNameDef]." Furtively darting her eyes back and forth, she muttered, "I tried sending them away, but they wouldn't take my hints." She shrugged.\n\n"I..." Ponse massaged one of his temples. "Fine. Send them in, Mayflower." As she left, he shuddered. The title of governor still sent chills down his spine.\n\nAlmost immediately, a pair of ponies—a mare and a stallion—entered. They laid eyes on the speech, and then the mare stepped forward. With a slightly mocking bow, she stated, "Governor Cocktail. I am Tunnel Vision and this is Guardrail. I'm sure that you've been informed why we're here."\n\nPonse remained silent. If she was put off by his attitude, Tunnel Vision didn't show it. Without missing a beat, she declared, "The Empress has sent us, and others, to assist with guiding this... quaint island." There was a faint scoff from her as she checked behind her and through the doorway. "I suggest you replace your secretary immediately. Too much independence in her."\n\nWith a grimace, Ponse ignored the quip and instead snorted, "I already have my own cabinet. They've not failed me yet."\n\nAt that, Tunnel Vision's eyes glittered, and she bore her teeth in a wide grin. "Oh, I'm afraid they've been replaced." She sauntered toward Ponse. Resting both her forehooves on his desk and leaning in, she tittered, "Replaced by us. After all, can't have them filling your head with anti-Order ideas, now can we?" With impunity, she patted him on the head like he was a colt.\n\nHe growled, but bit his tongue. Was there a point in arguing with a country that could wipe him off the map?"
  solarreworked.403.a:0 "Don't you think this is unnecessary?"
  solarreworked.404.t:0 "Superheated"
  solarreworked.404.d:0 "She knew it was going to be a horrible day.\n\nWas there any way that it could be sugarcoated? After all, as soon as she stepped out of the plane that had taken her to [PCB.GetNameDef], she had been blasted by heat. She hated heat.\n\nAs if to emphasize, a trickle of sweat rolled down Red Tide's forehead, and she testily wiped it away with a hoof as she waited, in the sun, for her motorcade to arrive to take her to the capitol. Empress above, she was going to melt if she stayed in Daybreaker's holy light much longer. She fiddled with the cloak she wore, and growled as the temperature controlling enchantments in it tried to compensate as best they could. Certainly wouldn't keep her COOL, but maybe not sweltering. Maybe.\n\nIn the distance, she could hear the crash of waves against the shores of the island, and for the briefest moment she pondered if the entire governor's quarters could be transplanted into the water. Instead, she closed her eyes and replayed Daybreaker's instructions. Keep the island in line. Make them model citizens, like everywhere else.\n\nBreaking them in the process would be enjoyable.\n\nEventually, she heard the roar of engines, and the motorcade finally arrived. A couple of soldiers, wearing only light colors and slacks of all things, stood at attention after they left a jeep. She arched a brow. Their rather cheerful demeanor twisted her gut, and she stalked toward them before getting to the jeep.\n\n"Welcome, Governess!" one of the soldiers exclaimed, joy practically oozing from his voice. There was approximately a two second gap between his statement and Red Tide whirling around and glowering at him. Still, he seemed unfazed.\n\nBaring her teeth, she snarled, "Wipe the grin off your face, soldier." Her horn sparked for a second or two, then she huffed as she wiped more sweat from her brow. "If I'm going to be stuck in this eighth pit of Tartarus, I won't be the only one miserable here."\n\nThe soldier merely nodded. However, the smile remained all the same, which earned a grunt from Red Tide. She wrinkled her forehead, and glowered at him threateningly. Oblivious or ignorant, it didn't matter, he declared, "But you would agree this is, uh, the best showcase of the Empress's weather, right?" Before he could continue his thought, there was a deafening crack as magic slammed into him and he collapsed onto the ground.\n\nRed Tide pressed her forehooves against his chest. "Try it again, and I'll show you what the Empress's fury is like, understood?" she inquired. He whimpered. "Good. Now radio ahead for something cold. Actually, frigid." She sighed under her breath. "Why couldn't I have been sent north instead?""

  solarreworked.430.t:0 "The Lost Crown"
  solarreworked.430.d:0 "Since the first pony settlements on the western edge of Griffonia, [EQC.GetNameDef] has been the crown jewel of the Empress's reach. Although compared to the Griffonian Empire, it is small, millions of ponies have called the islands and mainland comprising the colony home, and now chafe under misguided attempts at independence and no doubt yearn to be brought back under Harmony and Order's gentle yoke.\n\n[EQC.GetLeader] erred when [EQC.GetLeader.GetSheHe] believed that distance would make the Empress decide to let the slight of betrayal stand. Since [EQC.GetNameDef] has snubbed our authority, it has only degenerated further by influence from surrounding griffon nations and the radicals who believe they are the true followers of Harmony.\n\nIn order to save some effort, we shall first attempt to request they return to the fold peacefully, lest there be more pony blood shed. If necessary, we shall bring them back by force, and correct them as the Empress sees fit."

  solarreworked.431.t:0 "Dispatch of the Sun"
  solarreworked.431.d:0 "A message for [ROOT.GetLeader] arrived today from Equus, specifically from [FROM.GetNameDef], requesting that we submit to Daybreaker again. Although there was nothing said specifically, the short telegram was clearly a veiled threat for further action if we do not agree to Daybreaker's demands. There is an ocean that separates us and [ROOT.GetNameDef], so it is entirely likely that nothing will come of the matter, but there is still the chance that if we refuse, we will face invasion on our soil soon.\n\nWe can prepare our defenses, but we are still outnumbered by [FROM.GetNameDef]'s military. Fending them off may not be in the cards for us. However, this is ultimately [ROOT.GetLeader]'s decision, and if we stand up for our new independence or not."

  solarreworked.432.d_a:0 "We have received word back from [FROM.GetNameDef] regarding the telegram that we sent to them. Surprisingly, there was little resistance from [FROM.GetLeader], who agreed that the colony will return to Imperial administration and that old institutions that were shuttered upon declaring independence will be reinstated. This turn of events was not expected in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but it has been met with enthusiasm by the Empress's advisors. Already a number of colonial administrators have been dispatched to aid with maintaining order there, in case the news is not received well.\n\nWith our hold in Griffonia restored, the Empress has regained her crown jewel and we have a location from which to launch invasions, if we so deem that Griffonia must be pacified to preserve Harmony."
  solarreworked.432.d_b:0 "A telegram has been sent from [FROM.GetNameDef] for Daybreaker, and the contents within are about what was expected. Although short, [FROM.GetLeader] has tersely declined the offer of reintegration within [ROOT.GetFaction] and claims that the ocean will keep them safe from her moves. Already the Empress's advisors have pushed for a response, although a military one is still up in the air.\n\nHowever, if we are to reclaim our crown jewel on Griffonia, we must strike back with vengeance. [FROM.GetLeader] believes [FROM.GetLeader.GetHerselfHimself] safe from the Empress's wrath. We must prove [FROM.GetLeader.GetHerHim] wrong."

  solarreworked.433.d:0 "When the battlecruiser HMS Golden Dawn and its entourage of screening ships arrived in the harbor of Sunset, the mood was instantly soured, although it was not because of a lack of fanfare. In a matter of fifteen minutes, Jet Set was alerted to the arrival of somepony from [EQS.GetNameDef] and hurried to the pier. His heartreat skyrocketed when he saw a few of his soldiers already there in parade formation.\n\nFor the last couple of minutes, he stood patiently, feeling the sea breeze blowing through his mane and spraying droplets of saltwater onto his glasses. However, he didn't touch them. Not when the unannounced visitor could emerge any moment. He swallowed nervously.\n\nJust as he was about to give into the irritation, there was clanking of gangplanks, and soon one was lowered from the side of the battlecruiser. He stiffened at the sight of a uniformed mare, flanked on either side by guards. For a brief second, she surveyed the pier, then stalked down the gangplank. She disembarked and marched directly in his direction.\n\n"Governor General Jet Set, how kind of you to finally greet me," she spat as she reached him. In an instant, her piercing blue eyes had completely sized him up. Somehow, he could sense that she saw right through him. If there was one thing he noticed about her, was that she was YOUNG. Why would [EQS.GetLeader] send somepony who was so green?\n\nAfter gathering his voice, he merely responded with, "[EQS.Leader] didn't inform me that I should be expecting an—" He coughed "—an honored guest." At that, she lightly tittered.\n\n"How quaint," she retorted with a snort. Momentarily a snarky twinkle appeared in her eyes, and she brushed back her braided mane behind her topcoat. "Why would she announce that you should expect her official representative? You could easily hide damning details."\n\nJet's breath hitched. "I assure you, there is nothing that—"\n\nWaving a hoof dismissively, she strode past him. "Save your platitudes! I'm not an idiot. We shall see if there is a reason to trust your word." She paused. Turning back, she added, "But do be sure that it's a challenge. Certainly more than that pin of the old regime." She nodded at a symbol of the two sisters on his chest. "It's far from subtle regarding where your loyalties lie.""

  solarreworked.434.t:0 "Gears of Harmony"
  solarreworked.434.d:0 "Under her breath, Arcane Nova grumbled a few choice words as she rummaged through one of the file cabinets in the office that she had been let into. Although it was originally locked, a small chat with one of the cleaners of the parliament building in Sunset was enough to gain access. Didn't even have to press hard, given the griffon janitor was more than eager to see an arrest or two, which is what Arcane had promised.\n\nWhile most ponies who slunk about rooms where they shouldn't be tried to be stealthy, she had little reason to hide. After all, she was the Empress's representative there, and the Empress deserved to know anything and everything that was occurring.\n\nShe grunted as she slammed another door shut on the cabinet. Dividend was Jet Set's finance minister, and as likely a place as any to discover anything that was out of order. Thus far, all she had seen were different records of governmental budgets, showing, at best, that they had indeed cut down on expenses significantly after the economy collapsed.\n\nThere was little on the office's desk itself, aside from a quill, a number of blank papers, waiting to be written upon, and a single potted plant. Although slightly tacky, the plant was far from anywhere to be hiding anything. She had already checked, anyway.\n\nShe paused when she pulled out another folder and rifled through part of it. Something caught her eye. After slowly flipping back, she yanked up a single sheet of paper. "Shadowbolt Society." She hummed. If they were who she thought they were then...\n\nShe sneered. Pictures were beginning to be painted, but there had to be more concrete information.\n\nAs she started to put away the folder, there was shocked cry from the door, and she glanced up to see Dividend standing in the entrance, his eyes wide. Before he could backpedal through the door, she shushed him and dragged him inside with a harsh tug of her magic. She locked the door shut.\n\n"W-Who are you?!" Dividend demanded. "I-I carry in self-defense! D-Don't make me—"\n\nShe scoffed. With a wry grin, she asked, "And you would risk angering the Empress?" She flapped the paper in front of his eyes. "Oh, but you'll say nothing about this to anypony, correct?" When he squeaked, she added, "I can promise that if you inform the Governor about this, well..."\n\nShe shrugged. Waltzing toward the door, she briefly used her magic to shove him against the desk, pinning him and squeezing his throat, and then she left. "I think I made my point," she declared as the door slammed behind her."

  solarreworked.435.d:0 "Midnight Poppy tapped her hooves together. Across from her desk, the pony that had been sent from Equestria, the one who'd "keep the colony in line." Just the smarminess of that line alone almost made her grimace, but she remained collected. Arcane Nova simply stared at her, smugly, like she believed she couldn't be touched. Probably was the case, too, given everything. Midnight merely squinted at Arcane.\n\n"And you wished to see me because..." she finally began, breaking the tense silence like a hot knife through butter.\n\nArcane flipped her braided mane to be behind her other shoulder. Clearly a posture of perceived superiority. At that, Midnight narrowed her eyes further and hummed softly to herself as she caught the glint of the sunlight coming through and reflecting off the clasp of Arcane's cloak.\n\nIn a burst of magic, a number of written reports, which Midnight could tell was in her own hornwriting, appeared next to Arcane. She wordlessly rifled through a few of them, letting the papers crackle and flap loudly. Another tension-building tactic, no doubt. Also, avoiding the question.\n\n"I'm merely wishing to corroborate some reports. To learn why, as field marshal of this colony's armed forces, you have made multiple, questionable decisions." Arcane brought the first paper up.\n\n"How so?"\n\n"I beg your pardon?" Arcane shot back. Lowering the paper, she eyed Midnight warily, and Midnight craned one of her eyebrows in return. The dead air returned, but Arcane broke it with a nicker. "You know very well what are in these. You approved non-lethal force against ponies who protested [EQC.GetNameDef] returning to the Empress. You refused to arrest them. You have consorted the 'Shadowbolt Society' on arms procurement." She smacked the paper down on Midnight's desk.\n\n"Frankly, Marshal Poppy, a disgrace. Also little way to argue against it." Slowly, a sneer worked across Arcane's muzzle. "Of course, if you were to agree to—"\n\n"I'll agree to nothing," Midnight interjected, maintaining her professional and reserved demeanor. Readjusting the rank insignia on her uniform, Midnight stated, "I kept more order by not killing our citizens and sparking colony-wide riots. I didn't arrest them because it's still their right to protest. The Shadowbolt Society has control of a large portion of the military-industrial complex and can't be avoided." She snorted. "Frankly, this witch hunt reeks of an inferiority complex, Arcane." As she leaned forward on her desk, she asked, "To whom are you trying to prove yourself?"\n\nAt that, Arcane blanched, and she quickly hopped to her hooves. With a huff, she marched out and snapped, "I've heard all that I need from you.""

  solarreworked.436.d:0 ""Oh, do tell!" Upper Crust tittered before she sipped on a small teacup. The middle-aged mare's face was slightly crinkled in a smile as she sat opposite Arcane Nova, who was instead drinking some coffee. Dancing sunlight played across the glass coffee table near the window, which overlooked the city of Sunset. Although Arcane was deadpan in her expression, she twitched uncomfortably a couple of times.\n\n"I'm not here to speak about myself or Vanhoover," Arcane huffed after she took a small gulp of her drink. "This entirely revolves around your husband." She furrowed her brow. In turn, Upper Crust's playful expression died and was replaced with a solemn stare.\n\n"But learning of the latest news in Equestria—"\n\n"The Empire," interjected Arcane with a bit of venom.\n\n"Yes, yes, whatever you say, dear," Upper Crust replied with a dismissive wave of a hoof. "Around here, it doesn't matter what the coat of paint is." With a sigh, she put down her tea and gazed out of the window. Unlike much of the modest dwellings in the capital, the sitting room was one of several in the governor's residence. Lined with marble and inlaid with silver and polished copper, it was a stark contrast to what most ponies experienced.\n\nAll the affluence without power made Arcane's stomach churn. What right had they to claim this? They, who were tied to the old ways, who had almost made her homeland collapse? At least the Empress was deserving of her wealth, unlike these bloodsuckers.\n\nHowever, she didn't voice her distaste. Instead, she grunted, "And that attitude is why the Empress sent me." Bearing her teeth in a grin, she brushed aside her braid and stated, "And learning more about your husband would surely allow me to accurately report to the Empress."\n\nUpper Crust whipped back to scrutinize Arcane. She narrowed her eyes. "Really?" she inquired. "I'm sure you could ask Jet Set himself any questions you may have."\n\nSlowly, confidently, Arcane got off the couch she reclined upon and sauntered her way near to Upper Crust. Bending down, she snarled, "Yes, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to be more prying than he would like."\n\n"I believe you should—"\n\n"Stay?" Arcane inquired. She pulled out a few papers from her cloak. "Unless, of course, you would prefer I return these interesting receipts I found with Sour Sweet to the Empress?"\n\nAt that, Upper Crust's face paled. "M-Maybe you should stay," she stammered."

  solarreworked.437.t:0 "Night Tells All"
  solarreworked.437.d:0 "It was all too easy. Upper Crust's resolve had crumpled in short order, but it was still only circumstantial and a couple of witnesses. There had to be more.\n\nThose thoughts whirled in Arcane Nova's head as she slunk through the empty halls of the [EQC.GetAdjectiveCap] Parliament Building. Outside, through one of the windows, she spotted the moon hanging in the clear night sky, its silvery glow reflecting off the waters of the harbor making the surface appear like it was made of glass. Most houses' lights were off, as she pulled out a pocket watch and checked the time. Almost two in the morning.\n\nAny self-respecting adherent to Harmony and Order would be asleep, but sometimes duty called. That duty, she mused to herself, had just arrived. When she came up to the locked office of Jet Set, she grinned and whipped out a key. A key that Upper Crust had been too happy to provide to avoid any implication in Arcane's report to the Empress.\n\n"Such loyalty," Arcane chuckled to herself as the lock in the door clicked and she swung it open. Inside, the room was only lit by the moon, which cast long, foreboding shadows across the central desk and stacks of papers on it. Confidently, Arcane strode into the office and clicked the door shut. There was little risk of being spotted, but if a random custodian passed by, it was better to be safe than sorry.\n\nLoose ends were such a pain, after all.\n\nAlthough there was much that she would need to search, her focus was already honed in on only one set of information: anything pertaining to the Shadowbolt Society. A little research had proved her suspicions, as the founder of it traced his lineage back to the last Shadowbolt commander before the traitorous aerial squadron was destroyed. Never mind the fact the society tabled Anti-Order values. The former was reason alone for it to be damning.\n\nWith vigor, despite the hour already weighing heavily on her tired mind, she tore through the stacks of paper on the desk, but found nothing. However, that meant little. She grinned and procured another key from her pocket, and slid it into the lock on Jet Set's desk. Another went into a filing cabinet near a small flag of the colony in the far right corner.\n\nShe didn't have to rummage for long. After roughly half an hour, she withdrew a communique between Jet Set and Sour Sweet. A carbon copy had been sent to other Shadowbolt members. Not only was the society influential socially, it had members who were MPs. Plus, a few laws to be tabled that'd benefit them, too.\n\nBaring her teeth in a sneer, she chuckled. It WAS too easy."

  solarreworked.438.d:0 ""And as evidenced by these contracts with industries owned by a shell company, which I traced back to Sunny Flare, this is one more piece of the puzzle proving Jet Set's culpability." Floating up a series of papers, Arcane Nova passed them over to Daybreaker, who was sitting across the table from her. A couple of guards stood silently at attention in the meeting chamber of the Empress, but they didn't appear to be listening to the conversation.\n\nBarely containing the energy that was threatening to make her fall into a quivering and  nervous sack of flesh on the floor, Arcane Nova watched with anticipation as Daybreaker perused the contracts. Before that, Arcane had presented the laws recently passed, the discovered history of the Shadowbolt Society, and some of the rare filings of their financial activity. Multiple, recent armed rebel groups against the Empress's rule HERE, on Imperial soil, had been funded by them.\n\nIt was an open-and-shut case.\n\nYet Daybreaker merely hummed. "Yes, there is something here," she finally stated as she went over everything that was before her. Looking up, her eyes pierced the very soul of Arcane. "But do you have TRUE culpability?"\n\n"I—"\n\n"Do you have CONCRETE evidence that Jet Set has actively worked with this Shadowbolt Society?" Daybreaker's words slammed Arcane down from the high she had been riding on the entire trip back to [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Like a shattered mirror, Arcane's resolve crumbled and she let out a pouty sigh.\n\n"No. Not directly," she admitted under her breath. Without hesitation, she shot back, "But there is evidence of his financial minister, multiple MPs, and even his wife! If he—"\n\n"—Didn't know, then ponies may riot. He is popular amongst them, you know." Getting up, Daybreaker sauntered past Arcane to stare out the window to [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] below. For a moment, Arcane saw her nibble on her lip, and her fiery mane slowly pulsed between its normal orange and a dimmer red.\n\nAs seconds dragged on, Arcane blurted out, "There is no way he could not have known. He must be punished for his crimes with these rebel supporters." Although her knees threatened to knock against each other, she drew herself straighter and declared, "I can be the one to be your will, Empress. Permit me to lead."\n\nFocusing back on Arcane, Daybreaker narrowed her eyes and she huffed, "Yes, and you would like that, wouldn't you?" Arcane's face paled. As Daybreaker scrutinized her, she nickered and faced the window. After a moment, she voiced her conclusion."

At this time, she has not returned from [EQS.GetNameDef], and there is a large ocean between us and them. While it appears that [EQS.GetLeader] is remaining lax, that could change. We could simply ignore her and follow our own foreign policy, or we can continue to follow her to remain safe. It all matters on how much we are willing to risk."
  solarreworked.439.d_b:0 "The whereabouts of [EQS.GetLeader]'s representative, Arcane Nova, have been a mystery since she disappeared a couple of weeks prior, but today we now know where she vanished to. It was no secret she was ascertaining the loyalty of our government, but as one pony, she was deemed to be unlikely to find much. That appears to have been wrong, as she has found supposed evidence that is damning to everypony, from the lowest MP to Governor Jet Set himself.\n\nToday, she arrived in Sunset's harbor with three warships and a small detachment of troops, and has forcibly disbanded Parliament. Since then, she has been in talks with Jet Set, as she has declared that [EQS.GetLeader] has placed her in charge of the colony, and Jet Set will be relieved of his duty and will organize the transition to her rulership. However, Arcane still does not have much power here, and we can simply arrest her instead, although this may incur the wrath of [EQS.GetNameDef] if we resist. Whatever decision is made, the fate of the colony hangs in its balance."

So far, some unrest has occupied part of her forces, but she has maintained a strong grip on Jet Set's residence, and turned it into a fortified position.\n\nWe still have loyal elements within the military, but most of the populace appears unconcerned, and the griffon minorities may even support it. We still have opportunity to resist [EQS.GetLeader] and free Jet Set, but it may incur retaliation from [EQS.GetNameDef]. This choice shall decide the fate of the colony."

  solarreworked.440.d:0 ""Come in, Governor," Jet Set heard Daybreaker declare as he was escorted into the war room inside the Imperial Palace. Despite the rest of the building being illuminated by the bright sun no matter where one went, this was dim and barely lit beyond Daybreaker's mane. Seeing her, Jet Set's heart jumped into his throat. This was what Celestia had become?\n\nAs he was led to a few paces in front of her, she watched, expressionless, save for the faintest of smiles. What used to be a calm and soothing mane that flowed in an ethereal wind was now a raging, blue flame which nearly blinded him. When he was in front of her, he felt his eyes smart and tear up at the intensity of the light coming from her mane. She merely looked at him.\n\nBoth guards jabbed him at the same time with the butt of their rifles, and he gagged. Briefly searching his mind, he growled and, between coughs, knelt. After a few seconds, Daybreaker stated, "Rise."\n\nAs he got to his hooves, she inquired, "Tell me, in your own words, how the state of the colony is." She trotted a couple of paces closer. Despite his dazzled eyesight, he noticed that she rested a forehoof on a map of Griffonia, roughly where [EQC.GetNameDef] was located. She practically leered toward him.\n\nHis mind raced. The summons had been clear, but still, Daybreaker was Celestia. Celestia, if nothing else, was perceptive. Any fib was likely to be noticed.\n\n"Lost for words?" Daybreaker interjected, which made him bite his tongue. There was no reason to panic. Just needed to stay calm. However, she moved closer, and the smile which had begun to form on her muzzle morphed into a snarl. "Perhaps it's because you have something on your conscience?" Her next step slammed into the floor. Spiderweb cracks splintered across it. "Maybe secrets that shouldn't be brought to light?"\n\n"Is this because of Arcane Nova?" Inwardly, he cursed himself for such an obvious question.\n\nDaybreaker sneered. "Of course it is, Governor." Her mane whipped and thrashed, blasting him with sweltering heat. "But I dismissed them. Surely, you're a loyal pony and wouldn't consort or know of any consortia within your government with anti-Harmonists and not report it."\n\nShe traced a hoof across the map. "I hear that [WNG.GetNameDef] has been making moves lately. I'd hope that you'd have allies who could help, if they ever invade." Turning her shoed hoof down, she sliced through the map, right over [EQC.GetNameDef]'s position. She grinned."
  solarreworked.440.a:0 "I'm sure there won't be any problems, will there?"
  solarreworked.441.t:0 "Loose Ends"
  solarreworked.441.d:0 ""Dear, you must take care of yourself." As Jet Set put a few more items in one of the luggage bags on the master bedroom's bed, his mane was tugged back by Upper Crust, as she fussed with it with a comb. His eyes burned and exhaustion pulled at him to collapse into the bed, but there was a short schedule for the trip back to [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. With his rule of [EQC.GetNameDef] concluded, there was little point staying, and he could probably be of more use back in Equus, anyway.\n\nRelenting, he allowed himself a brief respite and Upper Crust continued to straighten out his admittedly unkempt mane. Of course, staying up all night would do that.\n\nWhen she got closer, he briefly nuzzled her and sighed, "I simply wish that more could have been done."\n\n"I know, Jet, I know," Upper replied with her own huff. After another pull, she snorted, "And to think that that filly appeared so nice at first." At that, she put away the comb and then marched over to one of her own bags and started to pack some of her clothes.\n\nBefore getting much further, there was a crash as the door on the main floor to the residence was kicked down. At the noise, Upper Crust screamed and adrenaline shot through Jet Set's veins. He bolted out of the room. Where were the bloody guards?! He wasn't finished as governor quite yet.\n\nWhen he reached one of the sitting rooms overlooking the gardens of the residence, he skidded to a halt. A couple of Imperial soldiers waited at attention, and Arcane Nova was between them. She was, however, busy inspecting the fireplace in the room. She noticed him and smirked. "Why, Jet Set, how good of you to present yourself."\n\nShe sauntered close, and he took a step or two back. "Now," she began, cutting off any attempt at speaking, "I'm sure you're wondering why I'm here." She motioned to the soldiers, who moved forward. "Your guards were smart enough to obey orders from the Empress, and I can gladly say, you'll be meeting her face-to-face soon." As Upper Crust arrived in the room, the soldiers moved forward and restrained them both.\n\nUpper Crust froze. Jet Set merely glowered and struggled at first. Chuckling, Arcane declared, "You honestly didn't believe I'd let your crimes against Harmony go unpunished, did you?" She stared directly at Upper Crust, whose face went white as a ghost. Whining and carrying a mocking tone, Arcane added as Jet looked to his wife, "Oh, did Upper not tell you of how helpful she was?" She tittered. "I think you'll have plenty of time to discuss on the trip back."\n\nShe waved them off, and as they were being escorted out, she added, "Oh, and thank you for preparing my new residence!""

  solarreworked.442.d:0 ""Why, Midnight Poppy," Midnight Poppy heard Arcane Nova declare as, without knocking or otherwise inquiring if it was appropriate to enter, trotted into Midnight's office. Midnight glanced up. As she did, two other ponies, dressed in uniforms of [EQS.GetNameDef]'s military followed her. For a brief second, Midnight's heart skipped some beats, but she suppressed any surprise.\n\nArcane sat down calmly across from Midnight. In her own time, after fussing with her uniform, she merely smirked. "What a shock to see that you're still here." Her voice was practically laced with derision.\n\nMidnight rested her hooves on her desk. Arching a brow, she shot the other two ponies, a mare and a stallion, a furtive glimpse. With a small clearing of her throat, Midnight replied, "Yes, I do still lead [EQC.GetNameDef]'s armed forces." She hummed. "Should I ask why this is unbelievable?"\n\n"Should you?" Arcane countered. For a moment, she polished her hoof on her chest, while letting Midnight's thoughts wander. The amount of derision that was leeching off of Arcane was palpable, and Midnight could sense that their one, prolonged conversation from before had triggered something in the unicorn. Before she could open her mouth, though, Arcane leaned forward and flashed a cocky grin. "I thought you'd want to meet your new peers."\n\nShe jutted her head toward the stallion and then to the mare. "Full Band and Triple Strike have many years of experience of loyalty to the Empress." At that, Midnight's blood cooled. "Now, of course, I would never accuse you of disloyalty, but, mmm, there are hints of ulterior motives." Gesturing again to the two officers, she added, "So, the Empress has approved a military liaison here. They'll be working very closely with you. I'd advise you play nice."\n\nMidnight nodded. Forcing back a smirk of her own as she saw Arcane's slight twitch of the eye, she stated, "Very well."\n\nArcane gritted her teeth. "Oh, and, of course, you'll have to vacate this office." For emphasis, she turned over the placard that bore Midnight's name and rank. Fire practically burning in her eyes, she stated, "As governess, I'm relieving you of high command, and giving it to myself instead."\n\nAs a figurative knife twisted in her stomach, Midnight pushed a thin, placating smile on her lips, and she added, "Whatever you wish, Governess." She tapped her hooves together. "So, do you think this pettiness will make Daybreaker proud of you?"\n\nArcane's face turned red, and she snarled before stomping out. Midnight grinned as the door slammed shut."

  solarreworked.443.d:0 "Every bone in Iron Rock's body protested as he hauled another load of unprocessed ore toward the refinery. Sweat rolled down his muscles as he strained, his lungs screaming for him to rest and let them recuperate. As he yanked the trolley of ore, his jaw practically ripped off as the bit he had in his mouth dug into his face. However, he couldn't stop. He could feel the eyes of the guards watching him.\n\nIn the back of his mind, he counted the steps until he reached the refinery. It was only a few hundred feet more, he could make it. Straining, he struggled to envision the last time he had had a chance to sit down for more than a minute. All around him, even if they were distant, he could count guards under the command of Daybreaker and Arcane Nova. He inwardly cursed himself for joining that protest in Sunset when news first broke Jet Set had betrayed them to Daybreaker.\n\nWhile his blood boiled, his heart ached. Although he was constantly soaked from sweat, his greyish fur was at this point stained with soot and dirt from the mines. All for [EQS.GetNameDef]'s war machine. At this point, he dreamed of bauxite mining in his sleep.\n\nHe passed some other ponies, just like him. Their demeanor cowled, their posture defeated. One shot him plaintive stare. He swallowed instinctively.\n\nFocusing his attention ahead, he soon arrived at the refinery, and after offloading his ore, paused. Checking around his view, he noticed one thing. The guards were either busy and not paying attention, or they left large gaps in their patrols today. His mind raced for a second, replaying the talk about escape with other prisoners, and how a break in the fence was found. If he could potentially slip by while everypony was busy...\n\nBefore he could talk himself out of it, he darted for where the break was said to be. Whether emotional or logical, he couldn't stay there. If he worked much harder, he'd probably collapse of a heart attack. He put that thought away as he reached the fence and scanned his surrounding again. There was nopony.\n\nWith a gulp, he fiddled at it for a moment, and as he was scrambling under it, there was a shout and alarm that rose. He nickered. He'd been spotted missing! But before he could work up to an exhausted run, bullets began to fly.\n\nDiving to the ground, he attempted to retreat, but his world exploded into pain as a stray shot went through a fetlock. He collapsed, writhing, and soon, a pair of gun muzzles were pressed into his back. All he could do was whimper as there was a final bang, and he felt pain no more."

At first, it looked like it might have been a passing convoy, but when the cloud started to make its way down his family's road, a sinking sensation had built in his stomach before he glanced to his wife and chicks and then left the house. Around him, fields that had once been filled with workers before the collapse of [EQC.GetNameDef]'s economy lay mostly fallow and filled with dead crops. Only a small portion kept himself and his family fed through feed for the animals.\n\nBut now, he watched as the procession of vehicles, roughly ten in number, made the way down his long stretch of road, and he flexed his claws nervously. It was something the ponies were up to, no doubt. What that something was remained to be seen.\n\nBehind him, he heard his wife call, "Is there something wrong?" She stood in the doorway, holding with her the one rifle they had, and he sighed and grabbed it. He wordlessly shook his head. Flaring her wings, she snarled and stood out with him. After a moment, the motorcade stopped about fifty feet from the porch of his homestead, and a couple of ponies got out. Not uniformed. Civilians.\n\nHe ruffled his crest feathers, his cheeks growing hot as his flustered brain tried to place what was happening. Whatever it was, it wasn't ideal.\n\n The ponies milled about. As more started to congregate from the other vehicles, he spotted a few soldiers leave a covered truck. Instinctively, he clutched at the rifle he was holding. Eventually, one of the first ponies to leave the vehicles waltzed up and declared, "Howdy! Uh, is this..." He glanced down at a sheet of paper. "One Hard Boiled Road?"\n\n"Yes?" Antonio voiced curiously.\n\n"Great! Well, if ya'll could kindly skedaddle, we've got to start setting up camp here." At that, the pony waved them away and moved back to the car he came from. "This'll make a great new house."\n\n"What?!" Antonio snapped. Taking to the air, he screeched, "This is MY home! My grandfather was given this by—"\n\n"Oh, well, sorry bud, but we got a permit right here," the pony interjected, tossing toward Antonio a rolled up piece of paper. "Now, if ya'll could move so that—"\n\n"No! I'm not leaving my—"\n\nAt that, there was a sudden sound of multiple guns being cocked and safeties removed, and Antonio's gusto vanished.

He checked his pocket watch again. It would be any minute, probably. With that reluctant thought, he switched his attention to the cityscape of Sunset and huffed. Not nearly as impressive as Manehattan or [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but certainly sufficient. Especially if the rumors were true.\n\n"Spreadsheet?" he heard a mare ask, out of breath. Turning to face the addressee, he smiled and got up to show Prime Location to the seat opposite him. With a sigh, she collapsed into it and wiped at her brow. She shot an apologetic grin his way, and he simply nodded. After her breathing calmed down, she stated, "Sorry for the wait. Busy clientele lately."\n\n"Understandable," Spreadsheet replied without a hint of emotion. He flagged a waiter. When he ordered Prime a coffee of her own, he arched a brow and asked, "It seems that business is booming with the recent laws passed, no?" He got a nod. "I'm sure you can guess what I'm here about."\n\n"Certainly isn't to catch up on old times," she snorted, then glanced down at a briefcase that was sitting next to him. "I can assure you, the location is as good as can be. Hundreds of offices for workers, near manufacturing, perfect." For a moment, her teeth flashed brightly and she cleared her throat. "Far from griffons."\n\n"Mmm, but could some be moved that way?" he countered, which made her nicker in thought. "You realize how much costs have gotten to be in [EQS.GetNameDef], no? If we can cut a few costs where we can, that'd be all the more beneficial." After a couple of seconds, he leaned forward and softly whispered, "Is it true they'll work for pennies?"\n\n"Well, maybe not literally, but, well, when you have nothing anyway and live in—" Prime rolled a hoof. After biting her lip and giving another, small hum, she finally muttered, "HARSH conditions, they may be a bit desperate."\n\n"Perfect. Don't need to see the location. Your judgement was always impeccable." At that, he flipped open the briefcase that was next to him and revealed a large pile of bits.

Nor was it because of the number of prisoners that surrounded him as he waited to be allowed into the complex. Heck, it wasn't even necessarily because it was because it was a pony prison. Rather, while the punishments used to be light before [EQS.GetLeader] decided to change her makeup, now, the stories coming from the jails and prisons in [EQS.GetNameDef] were like out of the worst war stories.\n\nTechnically, they didn't pass some of his own experiences, but that didn't make it any less anxiety-inducing. So far, it was at least somewhat lighter. Of course, the number of prisoners there experiencing said "light punishment" were more numerous than he first thought. With the expansion of Sunset into a proper naval city, more warships and civilian ships made their permanent berths in [EQC.GetNameDef]. No problem. If crews didn't exist, anyway.\n\nWhen his name was called and he was ushered through one of the hallways of the complex, he merely rolled his eyes and growled. On either side of him, in the surprisingly dim passage—given the love of the sun and light that most ponies under [EQS.GetLeader] went on about—he could make out packed cells, mostly with half-sober ponies and griffons. A few glanced at him with bleary eyes, while others simply slept.\n\nThe guard ahead of him was silent. Soon enough, he was unceremoniously led to another cell, which was crammed with a number of familiar faces. At least a couple had blood caked on them. Probably not their own.\n\nWith a huff, he stopped and shot one of them, a mare who was blinking away some of the sleep from her eyes, a tired glare. When she saw him, she gulped and then hissed as light assaulted her, even if minute. She whimpered and fell off the cot. After a couple of seconds, she stumbled to the bars and muttered, "Sorry, captain."\n\n"'Sorry,' sure." He whinnied in frustration. Glancing at the rest of his crew, he snapped, "Do you know that we'll probably never be allowed to port here again?! Great place, if someponies didn't decide to—" He cleared his throat and whipped out a small piece of paper. He paused. "Did you TRY to make a rap sheet as long as my arm?!"\n\n"No. Just half as long." The mare smirked. He could barely withhold a grin of his own.\n\nShortly, he motioned and the guard unlocked the door. "Let's set sail before I have to pull more favors.

Almost instantly afterward, a couple of bullets whizzed by and clipped the side of the barn. Glancing out into the field, he motioned in a random direction. While there was nopony visible, he smirked as he saw a couple of the stalks of corn shift. His lieutenant had seen the movement.\n\nHe sighed and slid down the back of the barn. Of course that upstart [EQC.GetAdjectiveCap] captain, Checkmark, thought that she could best him while he was on station from [EQS.GetNameDef]. Just because she grew up in [EQC.GetNameDef] didn't mean she knew everything. That was the sole reason that the Empress had approved the military exchange with Governess Nova. There was still much that could be taught.\n\nAt the moment, though, his heart beat against his chest and threatened to burst out of it. Bait was bad enough, bait on foreign soil and with an ambitious peer was worse. Those bullets were proof of that. While they might have been enchanted to not actually harm, that didn't mean they didn't hurt. Briefly, a single frame of memory flashed back of when he was hit by one in training back in the Empire. He shuddered at the sensation.\n\nAs the recollection passed, he strained to listen. Nothing. Silence. Pure quiet.\n\nHe licked his lips.\n\nSomething was up.\n\nAs that last thought went through his head, he glanced up and nickered as he caught the briefest silhouette of a pony shoot toward him. Barely reacting, he rolled to the side as the pony impacted and then fired directly where he had been. The barn took another beating.\n\nWhipping up into a standing position, he trained his own weapon on the assailant, and then huffed, "Captain Checkmark." He kept his aim on her. Likewise, she held her gun pointed at him.\n\n"Captain Bolt," she replied with the same, cold politeness. Momentarily checking her pistol, she nodded her head and stated, "It appears we're at an impasse. My squad has been rather busy with yours."\n\n"Good to know that sticking to the shrubs and the fields helped," he quipped. "You?"\n\n"Oh, we mostly stayed in the sky or used some camouflage." She shrugged. "It's rather popular—" As she was about to finish, another bullet zinged between them, and they traced their gazes back to where it had come from.

While the Empress could easily invade the islands, that would require much effort for planning, and would lower standing on the international stage.

Dragonlord Ember declared, catching Sunrise Sparkle's attention as the latter hopped off her chariot and landed with some thudding crunches from the small pieces of rock that shattered upon impact. Arching an eyebrow, Ember pointed a claw at Sunrise and quipped, "Hey, is that a new..."\n\nShe squinted and scratched her chin. "You got a new... cutie mark? Those are what they're called, right?" Blinking, she shook her head and grumbled, "No, that's not it. It's, uh, 'talent brand,' right? Or 'magic rune'? Or—" With a grunt, she shook her head and grumbled, "You ponies have such weird names for things."\n\nSunrise merely stared at Ember for a moment. Clicking her tongue, she trotted forward, her robe blowing in the wind and keeping her golden star cutie mark revealed. "Yes, that's what they're called. Cutie marks. A sign of a pony's innate talent." She scoffed and waved back at her two escorts, who remained at the chariot. Focusing again on Ember, she eyed the young dragonness for a moment and glanced past her at the seemingly always active volcano on [DRG.GetNameDef]. Ember quirked her brow higher.\n\n"Hey, is everything okay?" inquired Ember. Glancing around, she gave a small gasp and exclaimed, "Where's Spike? Is he okay? He normally is always with you." Her eyes narrowed, slightly.\n\nMatching Ember's scrutinizing glare, Sunrise simply stated, "Spike is currently busy helping back in... Equestria. The school, you see." She got a single nod from Ember. "But, the Empress wished for me to speak with you, and I couldn't say no to her." Whipping out a small list, she mumbled under her breath, "Pleasantries exchanged: done."\n\n"'Empress?'" Ember flared her wings. "What're you talking about, Twilight? What happened to Celestia?"\n\n"Oh, haven't you heard?" For a brief moment, a smile wormed its way onto Sunrise's muzzle, and she barely revealed a couple of teeth. "I guess not, after we got our land rightfully back."\n\n"Yeah, could we talk about that while you're here? Wanted to negotiate, since, you know, trying to rid the whole 'angry, greedy dragon' thing here." With a forced grin, revealing her fangs, Ember walked a bit closer to Sunrise. Staring her down momentarily, as a couple of clouds of soot floated toward the base of the mountain, she flatly asked, "You're not here about that, are you, though?"\n\nWith a titter, Sunrise stated, "Nope." Flicking her hoof toward herself, she indicated the guards to approach and she stood proudly. "Ember, Dragonlord of [DRG.GetNameDef]. Empress Daybreaker, Protector of Harmony, Shield of Ponykind, demands fealty." At that, Ember bristled. Veins bulged on her neck as she worked her jaw left and right. She scowled.\n\n"And?"\n\n"And," Sunrise echoed, "if you do not, she will gladly test just how high a dragon's tolerance for heat will go." At that, she flashed Ember a sneer.

  solarreworked.481.d_b:0 "Waves of heat blasted at Dawnbreak Shimmer's muzzle as the chariot descended toward the designated landing zone that had been provided by the dragons after the initial envoy had returned. Taking in the desolate wasteland, she scoffed. As far as the eye could see, there was nothing worthwhile for settlements. Barren stone, soot, ash, and a billowing tower of smoke from an active volcano were all that was of note. As her chariot touched down, she spotted a cyan dragonness, Dragonlord Ember.\n\nFor a second, they stared at each other, and Ember, who was flanked by a couple of burly dragons at least twice her height. Dawnbreak barely gave them notice.\n\nHopping off, she landed with a thud and kicked away at some of the stones that had rolled toward her hooves. Her robe flapped behind her, and she could feel the warmth of the volcano ripple across her. Although still distant, the glow of molten lava could be seen in the sky, even during the day. Still, though, it was of little consequence.\n\n"So, you're the one that got sent, huh?" Ember broke the silence, although her standoffish posture betrayed her distrust. Glancing between her guards, she took a couple of steps forward. She held out a claw. Although her frown softened a tad, she still eyed Dawnbreak warily. "I don't think that we've been introduced. I'm Ember, duh." Dawnbreak merely looked at the proffered hand.\n\nArching an eyebrow, Ember inquired, "I thought that ponies shook hooves when they first met?" Under her breath, she growled, "I KNEW Spike was wrong about that! It sounded so stupid!"\n\n"Dawnbreak Shimmer," Dawnbreak stated. Waltzing forward a couple of paces, she inspected Ember momentarily. Although a bit hard to read, there were tells. A slightly nervous tapping of a foot, a consistent and faint twitch under one eye, barely elevated breathing rate. Ember was ready to fight. She also was frightened. Dawnbreak grinned. "No doubt you've heard of what happened in Equestria?"\n\nShe began to pace back and forth. Both her guards held their guns at the ready for instant reaction. Ember gave a single nod. "Then, I'm guessing you know why I'm here?" At Ember's silence, Dawnbreak shrugged. "The Empress sent me. Simple message. You're on valuable land. You can either submit to her and accept her protection, and work for her, or you can perish in one, massive fireball."\n\nSuddenly starting back for her chariot, Dawnbreak looked back and shot a mirthful grin at Ember. "Your choice, but think about what your dad would think if he learned you made a mistake." With an irritated flick of her tail, she added, "Just which one is the right one?""

After enough pressing and promises of retribution if we were defied, Dragonlord Ember has bowed the knee to the Empress, and has sworn fealty to her. As recompense, they will provide some of their wealth and dragons for labor, but we will otherwise protect them from anycreature who tries to invade them.\n\nAlong with the news, the diplomat brought back a small number of gems, as a sample of what will be provided in future payments. They will need ships for dragons who don't have wings to be brought to the Empire, but otherwise will need very little intervention, as we now have a new labor force to draw upon for the future. This further improves our standing on Equus, and will help to further the Empress's plans for Harmony across the continent."

  solarreworked.484.d_a:0 "Stepping out into a frigid snowbank, Sunrise Sparkle furrowed her brow as ice pellets pelted her fur and robe. With each gust of wind, they clacked and splatted against her, leading to a staccato of retorts in the background as she stood, waiting, outside the great city of Yakyakistan. Despite the conditions in the Solar Empire, the yaks lived in almost constant winter, which probably was to their benefit, given their shagginess. She merely scowled as another blast buffeted her and ripped through her minimal protection from the elements.\n\nShe clicked her tongue. Rutherford was late. As the thought entered her mind, her fur bristled and she sneered. Tapping a hoof on the snow, she briefly watched the small puffs of powder shoot up with each hit, before being whisked away in the gale around her.\n\nThe doors of the great city, despite easily being half a mile away, still appeared towering in her view. With a snort, she watched as they opened, and then folded her ears as the shrill bleats of traditional yak yovidaphones carried far into the valley. Both of her escorts staggered and shot her worried looks, and she merely waved her hoof to settle them.\n\nWithin short order, a procession of yaks two dozen long arrived and fanned out. The yovidaphone players staying in the back and, unfortunately, continuing their performance. After a few seconds, Sunrise arched a brow when Rutherford moved through the center of the yaks assembled. The musicians—if they could be called that—stopped. "Are they done?" she inquired flatly.\n\n"Most beautiful music! Yaks greet friend of pink pony with traditional yak greeting!" Rutherford stomped up to Sunrise, who remained fixed in place. Both her guards leveled their guns, but her horn lit and she pushed the barrels down. When he reached Sunrise, he easily stood twice her height, and for a second, glared at her. Then, a smile cracked upon his face, and he pulled her into a hug. Sunrise squawked.\n\n"Yak happy to see pony friend!" Sunrise hastily teleported out of his grip, and he stood embracing air. "But, where is pink pony? She normally visit yaks first." He glanced around in confusion.\n\nWhen Sunrise reappeared in a burst of magic, she snorted, gagged, and brushed off her robe. "Pinkie is indisposed," she stated. Marching up to Rutherford, she stared him down, and he furrowed his brow. "Daybreaker, Bearer of the Sun, Protector of Harmony, has sent me. Not her." Rutherford's frown deepened.\n\nWith a bright flash, Sunrise summoned a list, and she cleared her throat. "Now, I'm going to get down to business, since yaks like brusqueness." Leveling him with a glower, she declared, "The Empress has given you a chance for peace. Accept it, and be saved. I have a list of reasons why. Deny her offer and the help she requires to fight for Harmony..." She stopped. A smirk built on her muzzle. "Well, the results will be smashing.""
  solarreworked.484.d_b:0 "Dawnbreak Shimmer grimaced as a blast of freezing air whipped at her mane and robe, leaving her ears stinging as the thin fur covering them was easily overcome by the cold temperatures. Exiting her transport, she marched a few paces toward the doors of Yakyakistan, although they were still easily half a mile away. Unsurprisingly, the yaks were late, even though THEY were the ones who indicated the exact time and place to meet. Apparently, only the "pink pony" was allowed inside the "great yak city" of Yakyakistan.\n\nAt the mere thought of seeing the probably backward metropolis, Dawnbreak shivered. More than likely smelled like yak, too.\n\nTaking a few steps closer, she inspected from afar the two towering sculptures of yaks on either side of the door, symbolizing something about unity or the like. She snorted. Given how unstable the alliance between the yak clans had been, it was an irony that these were the only things left untouched by tragedies that befell Yakyakistan in the past. Perhaps it was some superstition about destroying the statues?\n\nShe shook her head, and then held her forehooves to her ears as she groaned. Earsplitting blares and toots from a number of yaks, who had emerged from the doors in a procession with armed guards, bored into her skull. Her guards also protested. Staggering to her hooves, she mentally focused on the middle yak of the group, Prince Rutherford.\n\nWhen he arrived, she bared her teeth and belted over the wind and agonizingly horrible music, "You're late. Tell them to knock it off!"\n\nRutherford stared at Dawnbreak momentarily, then snapped, "Pony tell yaks to stop playing traditional yovidaphone!" The music ceased. Although his eyes were hidden behind his shaggy fur, Dawnbreak could feel his eyes shooting figurative daggers at her. "Pony need to learn respect for yak ways," he snorted. "And, yak never early and yak never late! Yak get here right when he mean to!" At that, he stomped on the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust. "What pony want, anyway? Why not send pink pony? She friend of yaks."\n\n"Oh, you mean Pinkie?" Dawnbreak quipped, tilting her head a bit in mocking confusion. "Should have just said so." Rolling her eyes, she sauntered up to Rutherford and stared at him. "I'll keep it brief, so you can understand me." She wrinkled her nose. "Daybreaker demands that you submit to her." When Rutherford bristled, she sneered. "I know, you're probably thinking that's crazy, but hey, there's more to this deal."\n\nAs she flicked a bit of snow off a hoof, she looked at it and stated, "For protection, we just need a bit of what's in those mountains over there." She pointed to the surrounding range. "Not much. You stay safe. You can... smash, or whatever, and we don't have to bother with you again." Her eyes glistened with mirth. "Of course, if you don't want to do that... well, those awful musicians are going to be the least of your problems.""

However, in the case of the polar bears, that unity is still fragile, which has made them targets of aggression in recent memory. [PLB.GetLeader] still has a struggle to maintain order, and for the price of some freedom and concessions, we can provide that for them.\n\nLikewise, [PNG.GetNameDef] has undergone significant political turmoil regarding the monarchy, and could use a guiding hoof in ensuring it remains stable. They are diplomatically isolated, and would be easy to overwhelm if push came to shove. However, because they are rather backward and barely industrialized doesn't mean they are useless, as they could provide ports for our ships, and their land is speculated to be rich in resources.\n\nPonies have not stepped hoof in either nations' realm in generations, and the mere word that "Princess Celestia" will be sending a chosen representative to speak with both [PLB.GetLeader] and [PNG.GetLeader] has sent ripples through their respective societies. What news they have of the Empress's ascension is suspect, and it will be up to whom we send to ensure they understand that the Empress will not be trifled with.

  solarreworked.487.d_a:0 "Sunrise Sparkle barely squinted her eyes as Daybreaker's sun beat against the white snow of the frozen northern lands of [PLB.GetNameDef]. In her mind, she scoffed at the icy homes of the polar bears that trundled along the ice sheet that they called a road in Mathair Fearainn. With every step she took, chills worked their way up her legs, which only served to make her snarl and bare her teeth. Ahead of her, a couple of polar bears were escorting her through the main hold of their capital, as she was the first representative from the "pony princess" since the bears had been forced to unify.\n\nDid they even pay attention to the world outside their own lands? The bears themselves appeared salty, to say the least. Not in the way of a sailor, but more in the testiness they exhibited to her occasional pause or when they were blocked by another ursine. If they were even aware of what great enlightenment had taken place in the south, they did not say so.\n\nAccording to [PLB.GetLeader], who was on the tour with her, it was a great honor that Celestia – definitely Celestia – had taken an interest in their affairs. After all, Celestia had much more pressing matters to attend to, in [PLB.GetLeader.GetHerHis] mind. Sunrise snorted. Still, when they arrived at a great structure of snow, she suitably nodded and genuflected at the "ingenious architecture" of the Polar Armory and the "unmatched skill" that it must have taken to craft such a large, fortified structure out of the elements in the north.\n\n[PLB.GetLeader] smirked at her statement. "It must be quaint for a pony," [PLB.GetLeader.GetSheHe] stated, which made Sunrise blink for a second. Shooting [PLB.GetLeader.GetHerHim] a placating grin, she shook her head.\n\n"No! Of course not! But wouldn't it be a shame if it were be damaged in conflict?" At that, [PLB.GetLeader] slightly curled [PLB.GetLeader.GetHerHis] lip, revealing a sharp canine tooth. Sunrise gestured to the armory. "Of course, it must be a point of pride, and I can tell that you really... worked on it. But, you know, if I wanted to be a tourist, I wouldn't come on the Empress's business."\n\n"'Empress?'" [PLB.GetLeader] inquired while furrowing [PLB.GetLeader.GetHerHis] brow. "I thought Celestia was in charge?"\n\n"Oh, well, technically, I suppose she is." By now, all the polar bears in the group were watching her. In the sunlight, she caught a glint of the armor plates that were partly hidden by fake fur. It didn't matter. Sauntering closer to [PLB.GetLeader], she quipped, "Empress Daybreaker wishes for me to relay a message. I'm authorized to adjust it, and I think you'll be smart enough to accept my offer." She arched a brow. "Won't you?""
  solarreworked.487.d_b:0 "With a huff, Dawnbreak Shimmer blew part of her mane back from her face as she waited for the plodding polar bears she was being escorted by caught up with her. Sure, she could have trailed them, like expected of a dignitary of another nation, but it was like they wanted to show off their snow pile as something special. Congratulations, it was in the middle of an ice desert. Such an accomplishment. It didn't help that it was currently blindingly bright, but she managed to keep from completely having to shield her eyes as she watched them approach.\n\nAs some of her hairs bristled at the sudden gust of arctic wind that whipped through the frozen street she was on in Mathair Fearainn, she growled and held down her mane as best she could. Didn't stop it from beating around like a flag in the wind, though, nor her tail whisking to and fro. When the bears finally got to her, they parted enough for [PLB.GetLeader] to get within a reasonable distance of her again. She could sense the tension underlying the guards' actions, though.\n\nEvery ursine that passed them by appeared on edge. That much she could sense, although without touching them directly, she couldn't tell if it was because of her visit or something else. Still, what did it matter when she could be out of the frozen hell scape quickly enough if her tour guides stopped and agreed to just talk like sane creatures. Get in. Get out. Get them to submit, or not. Of course, it'd be easier if they just did.\n\nSnorting and flaring her nostrils, Dawnbreak asked as she flicked a hoof to indicate the large, reinforced ice structure that they were standing in front of, "What is this? Some snow fort for the biggest snowball fights north of the Crystal Empire?" Although it was a jab, it earned a smirk from [PLB.GetLeader[, who shook [PLB.GetLeader.GetHerHis] head and laughed softly.\n\n"It is our last stop, pony, this is the great Polar Armory." At that, Dawnbreak nickered. "True marvels of engineering are inside, for ease of delivery to our war bands." There was a flicker of amusement in [PLB.GetLeader.GetHerHis] eyes and [PLB.GetLeader.GetSheHe] appraised Dawnbreak with a hum, "But it is probably trite to a pony, yes? Our tour is concluded. You wish to speak, so what does Celestia want?"\n\n"First, finally," snarked Dawnbreak with a roll of her eyes. Holding up a hoof, she added, "Second, it's not Celestia, it's Daybreaker. Empress of Ponykind." She smirked. "And that's why she's giving you a chance to submit to her before she melts this entire, damn arctic shelf." When she finished, [PLB.GetLeader] bristled, and the other polar bears snarled. However, Dawnbreak merely flashed magic through her horn. "You can be reasonable, right?" she inquired."
  solarreworked.487.d_c:0 ""And this, here, is the the Great Ice Spire," Sunrise Sparkle heard her guide state as they came to the base of, as stated, a truly grand spire of ice. At least, it would have been grand if the towers and buildings of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] weren't hundreds of times more imposing, threatening, or awe-inspiring every day. But it wasn't like that had to be said.\n\nInstead, she gazed up at it, letting her eyes momentarily trace the single, spindly trunk of ice, which captured the light and amplified it in a display of bouncing rays. Mildly interesting, a tad breathtaking for a moment, but nothing more. When she finished, though, she focused on her guide again, smiled thinly and stated, "Oh, yes, I can see it's grand, all right."\n\n"W-We have not had a representative of Princess Celestia visit for over a century, forgive me if—" Sunrise cut him off with a wave of her hoof. Clamping his beak shut, he gave a weak grin to her and she could see him begin to shiver anxiously. She sighed and shook her head.\n\n"Unfortunately, my time is short here, and I really must speak with [PNG.GetLeader] and I can't possibly see any more of your—" she glanced around at the short, snow-covered houses of [325.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] "—lovely capital, but, uh, perhaps some other time?" At that, she started to tap on the freezing ground, and she narrowed her eyes slightly. "So... any moment you—"\n\n"That won't be necessary." As soon as she heard the voice cut in, Sunrise rolled her eyes and spun around. Stretching a wide smile across her muzzle, she exclaimed, "Ah, [PNG.GetLeader]!" She held her attention to the penguin, who was escorted by a handful of soldiers toward her. When [PNG.GetLeader.GetSheHe] got within a few feet, [PNG.GetLeader.GetSheHe] stopped and looked at Sunrise expectantly. "It truly is a surprise when a pony comes here. What does Celestia want?"\n\nFor a second, Sunrise's left eye twitched, and then she flatly stated, "The Empress, her majesty, Daybreaker, only wishes to offer you protection." [PNG.GetLeader] stared at her. Before there could be any protest, Sunrise continued, drawing up a smidgen closer, "She doesn't ask for much, and it would help keep [PNG.GetNameDef] safe and unspoiled." Gesturing back at the Great Ice Spire, she asked, "You wouldn't want this destroyed, would you?"\n\nAfter a short pause, [PNG.GetLeader] quipped, "Actually, pony, it's rather dull, don't you think?"\n\nSunrise flinched. With a growl, she declared, "It's horrible! But, if you don't want your country to be as flattened as it should be, you'd best consider my offer very, very carefully." She didn't even bother reacting to the guards drawing guns on her. "Understand?""
  solarreworked.487.d_d:0 ""Okay, and when we're done here, we're finally going to meet with [PNG.GetLeader]?" Dawnbreak Shimmer inquired as she was taken, quite forcefully, by the hoof, and her penguin guide dragged her through the city of [325.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. After seeing supposedly the world's largest snowball, her head was starting to throb at the thought of seeing another one of the tourist baubles instead of getting straight to the point. It wasn't like her time was unlimited, anyway.\n\n"Y-Yes! [PNG.GetLeader] wished for me to show you our greatest achievements! We have not had a pony visitor, especially from Princess Celestia, in a century or more!" Only for a moment did her penguin guide glance behind him to look at her, excitement practically painted on his face. With every slap of his webbed feet against the ground, she felt her headache coming on stronger.\n\nAfter winding through a few of the icy streets of [PNG.GetNameDef]'s capital, she and him arrived at a towering spectacle: a single spire of ice, jutting into the sky. What light there was easily refracted through it, appearing as a massive spindle of fire. Dawnbreak did manage to arch ane eyebrow. It was mildly interesting, to say the least.\n\nSquawking happily, her guide waddled up to it and declared, "This is the Great Ice Spire! It represents our tenacity, living in these conditions." He shrugged. "Barring we're also perfect for this weather, but visitors are awed by the artistic meaning behind it." At that, Dawnbreak merely rolled her eyes and huffed.\n\nSuppressing a couple of shivers, she marched closer to the guide and snapped. "[PNG.GetLeader]. Now. I don't have all day."\n\nAs the guide practically sweated bullets, Dawnbreak heard another voice jut in as the steady beat of webbed feet on frozen pavement approached. "That won't be necessary," the voice stated, and she turned to see [PNG.GetLeader]. She barely withheld a smirk.\n\n\"I take it you were avoiding me?" she inquired bluntly.\n\n"Getting affairs in order. Finishing paperwork. It was surprising to hear a pony wished to come here, especially Celestia's representative." [PNG.GetLeader.GetSheHe] arched an eyebrow. "What does she want? We have little to offer."\n\nDawnbreak's grin grew bigger. Sauntering up a bit closer, she stated, "Well, the EMPRESS, Daybreaker, has a simple offer." She stood up, eyeing [PNG.GetLeader.GetHerHim] momentarily, her brain and heart working in unison to sense [PNG.GetLeader.GetHerHis] thoughts. "If you want for this place to remain peaceful and untouched by outsiders, then you might want to accept it." For emphasis, she sparked her horn, and despite the guards leveling their guns at her, she leaned forward and sneered at [PNG.GetLeader].\n\n"Submit and make the Empress grow wealthier, for preserving Harmony, or perish.""

She watched ogled by the various griffons from the disparate regions of Griffonia who had settled there, but she paid them no heed. What they thought of her meant little, as she was more focused on [ROOT.GetLeader] than she was of anycreature else. While griffons could be a passing oddity, even to her, stopping one to ask if he or she would like to be part of a study on non-pony or pony-like creatures and flight would probably earn some distaste.\n\nWhen she exchanged a glance with her guard captain, she stomped down the icy cold stonework of the station platform. Arising in the distance, some of the Griffonia-like spires and towers of the old city of Weter jutted out into late afternoon sunlight. As she continued to trundle her way to the station exit, she shot a couple of staring griffons piercing glares, and they quickly averted their gaze.\n\nAlthough the city seemed clean and proper, she could taste the thin facade in the air. It was still sickly, especially after Teafeather's death. She softly clicked her tongue. Would he have been a roadblock or would he have cooperated more readily. [ROOT.GetLeader] was more of a wildcard. The thought made her head throb, if only slightly.\n\nReaching the exit, the door was opened for her by her guards and she suppressed a grim smile as she spotted another procession making their way to the station, too. Surrounded by soldiers, [ROOT.GetLeader] filtered [ROOT.GetLeader.GetHerHis] way to the front, and eyed Sunrise. With a barely perceptible narrowing of [ROOT.GetLeader.GetHerHis] eyes, [ROOT.GetLeader.GetSheHe] quipped, "What does Daybreaker's favorite thug want?"\n\nSunrise revealed her teeth. "I guess my reputation precedes me," she stated with a titter. Smugly lowering her eyelids, she declared, "I think you know why I'm here, but I'll make my case anyway." She glanced to the guards around [ROOT.GetLeader]. "The Empress has a very simple request: submit or die." Giggling softly, she added, "For a small price to pay, she'll offer protection, and you can keep doing whatever it is you want." Her eyes flashed. "For now, anyway."\n\nWhile her horn flickered with magic for a moment, she asked, "So, what do you say? I think survival is quite important, if you ask me.""
  solarreworked.490.d_b:0 "Drops of sweat trickled down the back of Dawnbreak's neck as she watched from a catwalk of a number of griffon laborers, as well as a few penguin, toiling along an assembly line. Although it was still sunny outside, the factory was dim and grimy, with a constant, thin cloud of black hovering near the ceiling. The stench of soot, body odor, and blood filled her nostrils, but she barely had a reaction to it. Beside her, [ROOT.GetLeader] also watched the activity unfold. Both were surrounded by their own guards, who were eyeing each other with suspicion.\n\nDawnbreak tapped both her forehooves on the catwalk railing. Shooting [ROOT.GetLeader] a wary, askew glance, Dawnbreak sized [ROOT.GetLeader.GetHerHim] up momentarily. Faint sensations of confusion, worry, and frustration tingled her nerves, but she couldn't otherwise get a read. Either way, aside from a short exchange of rebuffs, [ROOT.GetLeader] had agreed to provide a tour of one of the leading military factories in Weter, as it was part of the planned itinerary. Outwardly, it was for potential contracts, but Dawnbreak could only smirk at the naivete of it all.\n\nAs one of the workergriffs finished a rifle, she lit her horn and floated it up to the catwalk. Instantly, the guards by [ROOT.GetLeader] leveled their own guns at her, but she blew them off with a raspberry. "Just wanting to check it out," she quipped. She scrutinized the finish on the barrel and checked its smoothness. Excellent quality, if maybe a bit outdated.\n\nShe brought it down. "There are more like these? Your armory is stocked?"\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] merely furrowed [ROOT.GetLeader.GetHerHis] brow and frowned at Dawnbreak. "Whether that is the case not is irrelevant, pony." Dawnbreak scoffed at the derogatory remark. "Is this trip for business or not? Daybreaker is wasting my time if—"\n\nDawnbreak held up a hoof. Levitating the gun again, she twirled it around a few times in her telekinesis, and she stated, "Oh, it's business all right. The Empress's business." When she finished spinning the rifle, she had the empty chamber pointed right at [ROOT.GetLeader]. "She has a simple ask: you "donate" the majority of your weapons for defending Harmony, you get her protection. She gave a derisive snort. "I'd like to see what one of these babies can do when supercharged with magic." With a small pout, she added, "Wouldn't you want to make sure that's pointed away from [ROOT.GetNameDef]?"\n\nAs [ROOT.GetLeader] bristled, she smirked and added, "I hope so.""
  solarreworked.490.a:0 "We are independent for a reason."
  solarreworked.490.b:0 "We can't stand against Daybreaker's firepower."
  solarreworked.491.t:0 "The Griffon Speaks"
  solarreworked.491.d_a:0 "Earlier this morning, a communique from [SOLGetDiplomat] arrived for the Empress, and contained within the promise of submission from [FROM.GetLeader]. Although the griffons of the north have an independent spirit, they are also not unwise, and between our generous offer of protection in exchange for some materiel support, they accepted with little protest. Already, we are dispatching some new administrators to help with the transition, while [SOLGetDiplomat] is on her way back from Weter.\n\nAccording to [SOLGetDiplomat], the supplies and support from [FROM.GetLeader] will arrive soon, as it was made clear that hesitancy would not be accepted by the Empress. With the colony under our influence, we may have to contend with rival interests in it, but the Empress will be more than capable of retaliating to guard our new territory."
  solarreworked.491.d_b:0 "Today, word has been sent from [SOLGetDiplomat] after speaking with [FROM.GetLeader]. Although she has done what she could to drive the point home that we are the only hope that [FROM.GetNameDef] has in surviving, [FROM.GetLeader] was staunchly against any concept of submission, and has rejected any future of being under the Empress's hoof peacefully. [SOLGetDiplomat] was subsequently ushered back to her train car, and is on her way back from Weter.\n\nWhile this was not the news that was wished for, it is also not surprising, and the Empress has already begun preparations for our official response. Although [FROM.GetNameDef] is distant, it is still on our home continent, and it is time they learn that the Empress will not be spurned by upstart nations like it."
  solarreworked.491.a:0 "They are no foals."

  solarreworked.492.t:0 "Across the Celestial Sea"
  solarreworked.492.d:0 "Although it is much younger than [ROOT.GetNameDef], [GRD.GetNameDef] is perhaps the only peer on the world stage compared to us. At one point, it spanned the entire continent of Griffonia, barring the River Coalition, but internal corruption and rot, as well as the instability of societal revolution brought much of its territory under the control of rump states and independently-minded nobles. Now it is but a husk of itself, although recent developments within Griffenheim after the death of Grover V has indicated there may still be life in the cadaver.\n\n[GRD.GetNameDefCap] itself still has some clout in the diplomatic world, as there was at a time a changeling military exchange program with them, which aided both their militaries. Unlike the smaller nations on Equus, we cannot simply barge into their countries and demand submission. We must treat [GRD.GetNameDef] as an equal, and to that end, we must propose alternate measures of mutually-assured cooperation.\n\nAs forging some kind of military deal with [GRD.GetNameDef] would be a crowning achievement for the Empress, especially if it benefits us more than them, we must have all hooves on deck for the diplomatic mission. Both Sunrise Sparkle and Dawnbreak Shimmer must attend the negotiations, for only their combined input will be enough to convince [GRD.GetLeader] of our intentions and desire for friendship and order."
  solarreworked.492.a:0 "We must put our best hooves forward."
  solarreworked.493.t:0 "Imperial to Imperial"
  solarreworked.493.d:0 "Leaning her head out over the side of the oversized chariot in which she and Dawnbreak Shimmer rode, Sunrise Sparkle watched with mild fascination as the griffon capital of Griffenheim appeared in the distance. As it was situated at intersection of three rivers, its boroughs and suburbs stretched for miles around the center of the city, where the water met and flowed eventually into the north Celestial Ocean. Despite herself, Sunrise couldn't help but smile at the display. While it was no [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it still was an impressive sight. In her heart, a tiny well of giddiness rose within her.\n\nShe glanced to Dawnbreak. "Do you think we'll have time to explore some of Griffenheim? I know that the Empress sent us here for a reason, but there could be something I could bring back!" She squirmed in anticipation. "Maybe a griffon brain, or a tome on griffon enchantments, or maybe—"\n\nWhen Dawnbreak merely shot her a bemused smirk, Sunrise cleared her throat and brushed down her robes befitting her rank of Lady Inquisitor. She steeled her expression. "Right. Business." That facade lasted for three seconds before it shattered and she grinned, "But just imagine! I've never been there and—"\n\n"You've been saying so for the last two hours," interjected Dawnbreak with a wry titter. "Perhaps you should, I don't know, focus on the mission?" After a brief pause, where she rested her forehooves upon the edge of the chariot and watched herself, "Although... you could be right. There's probably all kinds of hidden stuff there." Her eyes sparkled. "I can't wait to see some of the tanks designs that they—" She cut herself off and peered back at Sunrise, who was wearing a smarmy grin of her own.\n\nGrunting, Dawnbreak brushed away some of her mane and huffed, "Never mind." She snapped to the guards who had hauled them from an aircraft carrier off the coast of [FEA.GetNameDef]. Although there were more practical ways to arrive, it was the classic approach, and also always garnered attention. Plus, the Empress was the being of greater majesty, so making [GRD.GetLeader] wait was of little consequence.\n\nWhile the rest of the trip was made in silence, they arrived in short order, and Sunrise watched as a number of griffons stopped in their day-to-day lives to observe the chariot descending onto the streets instead of the runway. They landed right outside the Imperial Palace. Towering across the city, the Grand Temple of Boreas stood like a knife jutting into the sky.\n\nImmediately after disembarking, a haggard griffon arrived out of breath, and gasped, "Apologies, Lady Shimmer, Lady Sparkle, but [GRD.GetLeader] will not be available today."\n\nSunrise heard Dawnbreak growl. She merely arched a brow.\n\nWhen the griffon saw this, he gulped and anxiously fluffed his crest. "Please allow me to be your guide of the city today, if that would be acceptable?""
  solarreworked.493.a:0 "That may."
  solarreworked.494.t:0 "Tour of the Ancients"
  solarreworked.494.d:0 ""N-Now, if you'll please come this way, I-I'll take you to the Grand Temple of Boreas." Pulling unconsciously at some of his crest feathers, Sunrise Sparkle and Dawnbreak Shimmer's hastily-appointed tour guide of Griffenheim, Frederick, nearly stumbled into a couple of griffons as they wandered out of a nearby shop. With a loud squawk, one of the customers took to the air and nattered something at him in Herzlandish before spotting Sunrise and Dawnbreak. For a second, her eyes narrowed, but the female griffon noticed the guards that followed them, and then her eyes widened.\n\nQuickly backing away, she muttered, "Entschuldigung." With a hasty check of her shoulder, she and her companion spread their wings and scattered. As Frederick brushed himself down again, he swallowed when he noticed Sunrise inspecting the shop.\n\nShe held up a hoof. "Hold on, as much as griffon theology is fascinating in its... details, THIS looks more intriguing." She tapped Dawnbreak on the shoulder and her fellow pony scanned the sign as well. While Sunrise's Herzlandish wasn't incredible, from what she could determine by the sign, it was a second-hoof shop of antiques and trinkets. Turning to Dawnbreak, she inquired, "Should we? We're here, anyway."\n\nDawnbreak shrugged. "Couldn't hurt."\n\nBoth ignoring Frederick's protests, they entered into the store, earning a hurried greeting in both Herzlandish and Ponish from the proprietor, a fat, younger griffon. After brushing him off, Sunrise slunk through the shelves near the back of the antique store. She lit her horn, flooding the murky area with a reddish hue. It didn't take long for her to find something, as a glint of gold caught her eye and she pulled out a cracked, leather-bound book. Some of its lettering had worn off, but her eyes shimmered in excitement all the same.\n\n"Dawnbreak," she hissed, holding up the book. "Look at this." At Sunrise's beckon, Dawnbreak trotted up and she gasped.\n\n"Is that—"\n\n"It is!" Sunrise interjected as she started flipping through the pages. Musty section after musty section assaulted her nose with the fragrance of ancient knowledge, and she giggled. "It's ALL about hardening techniques and enchantments. Just think of how I could apply this to new interrogation tools!"\n\n"Or our military." Dawnbreak tittered excitedly. "Putting these on a bunch of tank shells? Goodbye enemy armored corps!" Puffing out her cheeks, she made a fake explosion noise. Both of them continued to whisper for a few minutes, and the proprietor glanced at Frederick, who shrugged while they waited.\n\nEventually, Sunrise straightened herself and she hauled out a pouch that clinked with coin. The storegriff's eyes stared hungrily at it, and Sunrise merely threw the bag onto the desk he was behind. Paralyzed at the size of it, he traced her walk toward the door, without moving a muscle. As Sunrise left, followed by Dawnbreak, all she exclaimed was, "Book!""
  solarreworked.494.b:0 "A fine addition to my collection."
  solarreworked.495.t:0 "Meeting of the Crowns"
  solarreworked.495.d:0 "Sunrise rubbed her forehead as the hours awake slowly dragged on her attention span. Where there was once sunlight outside the meeting room inside the Imperial Palace, of which there were many, there was now only the glow of night life from houses across the river. Dirtied plates and emptied glasses or mugs of water, wine, and coffee were arranged haphazardly around the places where she, Dawnbreak, and [GRD.GetLeader] and a couple of [GRD.GetLeader.GetHerHis] own diplomats sat. In the back of her mind, Sunrise chided herself for staying up far too late reading her newest literary acquisition.\n\nHowever, it had been too tempting! While it ended up being mostly magical techniques learned hundreds of years by ponies before the book was written, it was still a fascinating look into the griffon mindset. Besides, there were a couple of tips spread out for other practical things, like torture and information extraction. So it was still a win.\n\n"How would you propose specifics, though?" [GRD.GetLeader] asked while taking a sip of [GRD.GetLeader.GetHerHis] latest cup of coffee. Tapping a claw on the table, [GRD.GetLeader.GetSheHe] clicked [GRD.GetLeader.GetHerHis] tongue and stated, "The Empire has stood for hundreds of years. There must be tangible benefits for us, too." There was a small scoff. "You have made promises, but nothing concrete."\n\n"Because we need to iron out what YOU will offer us in return," Dawnbreak huffed. With a small nicker, she blew a smidgen of her mane out of her face and shot the griffons at the table with a glower. "We can't keep jumping hoops like it's going out of style." She snorted. "You're not helping your stereotype of liking to haggle."\n\nFurrowing her brow, Sunrise threw a warning glare at Dawnbreak, who motioned for her to settle down. However, Sunrise's mind raced and she barely paid attention to Dawnbreak's movement. There had to be damage control stat for the quip, even if it was true. She could see the feathers on the edge of [GRD.GetLeader]'s advisors ruffle, but [GRD.GetLeader.GetSheHe] remained neutral.\n\n"What I think Dawnbreak is TRYING to say," Sunrise began coolly, "is that we would appreciate simply laying all our cards on the table. No rambling, backstories, or tangents." Folding her forehooves together and ignoring the headache, she declared, "I've been allowed to get into details beforehoof, and that's what I'll do. For allowing us to see and experiment on your tank designs, we'll have our military scientists share their tactical knowledge, current and historical, and provide blueprints for advanced fortifications." She shrugged. "It's a start."\n\nSharing a glance with Dawnbreak, Sunrise flinched when Dawnbreak added, "Or you can tick off Daybreaker, if that's what you want." However, [GRD.GetLeader] only hummed, and Sunrise held her breath, expectantly."
  solarreworked.495.a:0 "No, we can't share our most guarded secrets."
  solarreworked.495.b:0 "We have much to learn from each other. Let's get down to business."
  solarreworked.496.t:0 "Call from Griffonia"
  solarreworked.496.d_a:0 "At first light, Sunrise Sparkle and Dawnbreak Shimmer have returned from their time away in [GRD.GetNameDef], and they bear news of [GRD.GetLeader]'s decision. While it was at times harrowing, including a cultural faux pas or two, they were able to convince [GRD.GetLeader.GetHerHim] of the benefit of our offer of exchange of military information and establishing teams for research in each other's nations. There were initially concerns about military security, but Sunrise rightly pointed out that we would have no reason to use what we learn on them, since they are across the Celestial Sea and of little strategic importance to the Empress.\n\nAfter ironing out more details, they returned with a booklet of different blitz tactics that the griffons learned from the changelings. Some of these have already proven useful, and we have, in turn, provided blueprints to some of our older fortifications. Further flow of information and technology is forthcoming, and the Empress has already sung the praises of [GRD.GetLeader] on the radio, so that all may know of our new, hopefully lasting, relationship with the Griffonian continent."
  solarreworked.496.d_b:0 "At last, Sunrise Sparkle and Dawnbreak Shimmer have arrived from their time within [GRD.GetNameDef], however, their arrival was a somber affair in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. In the days before they arrived, they privately conferred with the Empress, who has now shared that [GRD.GetLeader] has denied any chance of a mutually beneficial agreement between our two nations. Citing concerns for military security and also Daybreaker's own "callous and aggressive" stance on Equus, [GRD.GetLeader.GetSheHe] has rejected our advances and sent our diplomats home in shame.\n\nAlready, the Empress is promising our citizens that the insult caused by the griffons will be corrected, but that punishment will take time. Equus must be stabilized first, before they can possibly be given judgement."
  solarreworked.496.a:0 "Too good to be true!"

  ###Utility Events###
  solarreworked.500.t:0 "Empress of the Sea"
  solarreworked.500.d:0 "Even before the Empress ascended to the throne, the old lands of Equestria were the dominant naval power on Equus and the world, rivaled only by [GRD.GetNameDef] and [HIP.GetNameDef]. The old admiralty took pride in the ships that sailed under the flag, and as centuries passed, wood gave way to steel, which was spurred by a desire to maintain modernity with the two Equestrian naval rivals. However, that ultimate navy has aged, and younger nations have striven to take our crown and with new technologies appearing frequently, our old flagship is barely worthy of being used by the Empress.\n\nShe has decreed that a new class of warship, the Daybreak Class, shall be constructed on an advanced technology platform. Multiple proposals have been made, between an untouchable and heavily armed cruiser, an unstoppable battleship, or a carrier that can swarm the skies with fighters. It merely remains to be seen which shall be chosen by the Empress."
  solarreworked.500.a:0 "It shall be a battlecruiser that can chase down any foe!"
  solarreworked.500.b:0 "It can only be a battleship that shall be a fortress upon the sea!"
  solarreworked.500.c:0 "A carrier that can drown our enemies in planes sounds perfect!"
  solarreworked.500.e:0 "Perhaps we should wait until our technology advances further."
  solarreworked.501.t:0 "Herald of the Sun"
  solarreworked.501.d:0 "While it took years of nurturing and guidance, my niece, Nova Heart, has finally grown of age to be able to lead on the battlefield. Her training is as complete as it can be, and she can only learn further by striking down the threats against myself, my Empire, and Harmony; but this shall not be a challenge to her, for more than any other I have enlightened, she has taken to her calling and fervently punished every aspect of heresy and rebellion that has been placed before her. Only I have more knowledge and power than she, and she will lead my armies to victory across the world!\n\nAlready she itches to be put to the test in battle. She will soon have her wish."
  solarreworked.501.a:0 "She will bathe the battlefield in glory!"
  solarreworked.502.t:0 "Grand Betrayal"
  solarreworked.502.d:0 "In a display of utter cowardice, our subjects have unilaterally cut ties with us, now that the Great War has concluded. With [CHN.GetNameDef] now under our administration, [CRY.GetLeader], [EQC.GetLeader], and [PCB.GetLeader] have declared that they will not associate with a "tyrant" like [ROOT.GetLeader] and have refused any requests for communication. Whether they will join together to attack us remains to be seen, but they have all said that Harmony has long died in [ROOT.GetNameDef], and they must do what they can to keep its light alive.\n\nTheir betrayal was not entirely unexpected, but it still leaves us in a more vulnerable position. We may not retaliate immediately, but they must know that their days are numbered.\n\nNopony betrays the Empress and lives without retribution.\n\nNopony."
  solarreworked.502.a:0 "May the Sun incinerate them where they stand!"
  solarreworked.503.t:0 "Cleansing the Imperial Military"
  solarreworked.503.d_a:0 "Although the initial doubters of the former Equestrian Army have been removed from [EQS.GetNameDef] for some time, it was not thorough enough. After review, there have been discrepancies in some of the general staff's debriefs, missing equipment, soldiers allowed to go absent without reason, among many other detractors. At the moment, there is no one indicator who could be behind the betrayal of the Empress's trust, but it shall be found out soon enough.\n\nAs soon as word reached the Empress that her military was still far from pure, she dispatched various investigators from the Imperial Courts as well as loyal agents of S.M.I.L.E. to ascertain the culpability of the remaining officers and generals within the Militarium. Unsurprisingly, their questions have been stymied for some time, with the staff avoiding them with excuses of other appointments, or being in the middle of war gaming, among other reasons. That has not, however, prevented the investigators from coming away with evidence of corruption.\n\nIt shall only be a matter of time before the culprits behind the continued rebellion against the Empress will be brought to justice. During this time, it is ideal for another complete review of the Militarium. There are a number of old guards, who, perhaps, might not as of this day wish to fight against her, but may in time. It would be trivial to link any of them to the perpetrators of the actual conspiracy, when that time finally comes. It is only a matter of who is the most guilty, and who could be coerced to remain loyal, no matter how harsh the Empress's judgement of disloyalty is."
  solarreworked.503.d_b:0 "When the Empress proclaimed [EQS.GetNameDef], she expected that the sin and taint that plagued the old army of Equestria to be cauterized by her previous reformations and purges. While on the surface the Militarium looks to be pure and holy, recent inspections by the Inquisition have revealed it's still rife with both heresy, traitors, and unbelievers. All of them are insults to the holiness of the God-Empress's very being, but they are filled with guile. Only a few were open enough to admit after interrogation to committing heresy, conspiracy, rebellion, unbelief, or apostasy, and while they have been cleansed, the rot that resides within the Militarium is still festering.\n\nSince the initial investigations, the God-Empress, in her infinite wisdom and perfect justice, dispatched more inquisitors to further comb through every staff office, every base camp, every mess hall. Already thousands of the rank and file have been relieved of their lives, but the stench of heresy is still rife. The general staff has been as helpfully unhelpful as possible, through providing anything requested, after requiring as many hoops as possible to be gone through, and after redacting as much material as they can. While they continue to stymie the efforts of our inquisitors, it is only a matter of time before the cancer within is finally expunged.\n\nWith the God-Empress's holy Solaris Inquisitionis growing closer to the source of the taint every day, we still have time to ensure additional compliance. Another review of the Militarium is required, as there are still a number of former harmonists, old guards who have professed loyalty with their lips, but perhaps not their heart. Although none of them are outwardly in defiance, determining a few whom could be made as examples to remind the rest of what happens when the God-Empress is spurned may be necessary. Since evidence is turning up every day of the corruption within, including a few additional pieces linking the heretics to some of these old guards would be trivial, and a way to ward against further sin taking root in the future."
  solarreworked.504.t:0 "Further Purges"
  solarreworked.504.d_a:0 "Since the God-Empress has revealed the glory of her magnificent power, the Militarium has remained untouched since the traitors and rebels were arrested and sentenced to their righteous punishments of death by firing squad. However, it was not cleared by her holy Solaris Inquisitionis, and on another thorough investigation, inquisitors have unearthed taint and heresy that was not dealt with by investigators from the Imperial Courts.\n\nAs rectification, a new crusade has been called by the Lady Inquisitor to deal with this threat to the Empress, and the guilty are already being taken into custody so that they may admit to their crimes and be cleansed by the Holy Flame of the God-Empress. It will only be a matter of time until this cancer is excised, and the Militarium will be another saintly instrument which the God-Empress can use in her war against the unbeliever and the heretic."

  solarreworked.505.d:0 "Our border guards recently captured a pony fleeing from [FROM.GetNameDef] as they were being chased by a small number of [FROM.GetAdjectiveCap] soldiers. After a short skirmish, the [FROM.GetAdjectiveCap] force was fended off and the haggard pony collapsed from exhaustion. If it were not for the union pin that he had on his clothes, he would have been thrown into prison. Instead, he was taken to Altidiya Memorial in Petershoof, where he was given the medical treatment a fellow comrade deserved. When he recovered, he wished to speak to the first soldier he could find, and began to beg for liberation. Apparently he had been sent and aided by some of the unions across the Eastern coast of Equestria with a message: [FROM.GetLeader] is pressing down against the workers of the nation. Efforts to centralize and crush any autonomy in the country have begun, with ponies that resist being arrested for becoming a danger to the state.\n\nTheirs is a simple request. They ask that we put our bits where our mouth is, and fight to free them. Although [FROM.GetNameDef] is currently weakened, they are by no means weak. Will we stand for what is right, or bide our time for later?"
  solarreworked.505.a:0 "We will liberate the [FROM.GetAdjectiveCap] proletariat!"

  solarreworked.507.d:0 "With our recent liberation of the entirety of the Manedalusian peninsula, we have inherited a political quagmire that has brewed for centuries between ponies and non-ponies. Manedalusia, while small, occupies a strategic position in Northern Zebrica, with a valuable port of trade as its regional capital. Since 988, the area has been partitioned between the Maregyptians and Abyssinians, although the cats have little right to the land, as it has remained majority pony for over a millenium.\n\nWhile they continue to clamor that it is their territory by right, it is the Empress that shall decide the destiny of the region. As a land of ponies, it is hers to protect and guide, but the Maregyptians do have a case, as they have experience controlling the region and their cultures are at least somewhat similar. However, there is also value in keeping it for ourselves, for our own military uses as a base of operations, or permitting full autonomy. After all, a liberated populace is a grateful populace. The only option that we cannot contemplate is returning the territory to the cats. The era of non-pony rule is over. The Empress's ponies will be freed."

Within the communication from [EQC.GetLeader], the request was made for proper statehood for [EQC.GetNameDef]. Since we have re-established control of the rogue colony, [EQC.GetLeader.GetSheHe] has implemented Order and Harmony exactly as we have desired. The ponies of the colony are loyal and eager to serve the Empress and direct administration would permit some benefits for them as full citizens of the Empire. There is little downside to accepting their request, but having a local administration would allow the Empress to focus elsewhere and permit for more flexible government in the region."
  solarreworked.508.a:0 "They are a model crown colony and will remain so under [EQC.GetLeader]'s guidance."

  solarreworked.509.t:0 "A Beacon of Harmony"
  solarreworked.509.d_a:0 "Moments ago a communique sent by unicorn messenger arrived, sealed by the Empress's own hoof, for [ROOT.GetLeader]. When [ROOT.GetLeader] was tracked down, [ROOT.GetLeader.GetSheHe] was presented the communication and it was revealed that the Empress has made her decision around the fate of the colony. Although she agrees with the logic and the heart of the request, she has cited that there is little need or reason for [ROOT.GetNameDef] to be given statehood within [FROM.GetNameDef], as the current situation is working perfectly well. The  citizens of the colony have taken the corrections to Harmony and implementation of Order in stride, and their mettle has proven a model for other territories and their governors. To that end, further resources will be provided for [ROOT.GetLeader]'s disposal and the office of governor's powers expanded, so that the shining example that is the colony will remain.\n\nAlthough this is excellent news, as we shall retain local autonomy, Jet Set has expressed his concern around what it means for oversight by the Empress. He has followed faithfully, but his past still stains his reputation, and further oversight by the Empress could hamper the effectiveness of these resources. The instability of being replaced if he gets on her wrong side is also not missed, and will remain a cloud over his head for the foreseeable future."

While there have been a few voices of protest, given that she has the authority to overrule them, she has continued apace. True to the Empress's request, [ROOT.GetNameDef] will soon be a complete mirror of [FROM.GetNameDef] and any future worries about the Empress's approval will be a thing of the past."

Chunks of marble and stone were chewed out of the columns as the crack of gunfire echoed through the hallways. Acrid smoke clawed at her lungs, making her throat feel like it was already on fire. Surrounding her and her squad, long tongues of orange flames lapped along the walls. Dozens of ponies lay dead, their red ichor drying in the heat and leaving sections of the ground tacky.\n\nTaking a small peek around her cover, she let out a couple of potshots, and managed to score one of the [EQS.GetAdjectiveCap] soldiers. There was a spurt of blood, followed by suppressive fire. However, there was a barked order, and the gunfire started to travel down the corridor.\n\nThat was unimportant. Others had already gone before her, and more would come, to invade the bastion of the demon of light, but that was not hers. Every turn they took to get here was for one purpose: freeing HER. Intelligence indicated that Daybreaker had kept the Empress as a prize. Something to trot out and mock whenever she wished.\n\nIf it was accurate, behind the sealed steel doors in the middle of the back wall of the corridor, there was a network of tunnels that would lead to the Empress. Evening merely gulped and ordered her demolitions expert, Nitro, to the doors. Within moments, there was a deafening explosion as they were catapulted inward and crashed against another wall. Clouds of dust filled the air afterward.\n\nCoughing, Evening Star barked for everypony to follow her, and she charged in. As she galloped through the tunnels, her heart throbbed against her chest. Dozens of ponies pleaded for release in their cells, but she encountered no guards. Was Daybreaker so arrogant to believe nopony would try to free them?\n\nAs she took one last turn, she yelped as she ran straight into a guard, but reacted in time to fill him with half-a-dozen bullets. While gurgled and gasped on the ground, she and her squad arrived at the cell. Inside, the Empress could be seen. Her deep blue mane rippled and glittered with stars, making Evening pause momentarily.\n\nNightmare Moon noticed her rescuers, slowly pacing toward the door. She eyed Evening's leathery wings and inquired, "[BAT.GetAdjectiveCap]?" Evening nodded. The Empress shook her head. "The seal is magical. There is—"\n\n"Kaboom?" Nitro interjected, whipping out more explosives and staring excitedly at Nightmare Moon and then Evening. Nightmare Moon whinnied. She stumbled back as Nitro hastily set up more explosives along the hinges of the cell. In the resulting dust cloud, everypony gagged and Evening wiped at her eyes.\n\nSilhouetted in the haze, Nightmare Moon strode out, looking at the exterior corridor curiously. Evening and the others bowed. With tears streaming down her muzzle, Evening managed to choke out, "Welcome back, my Empress!""

Currently, some of the effects included rapid, spreading necrosis of chitin that ultimately leads to organ failure as it travels deeper; fourth-degree burns that leave targets at best mangled if not outright dead; and excessive tumors that lead to an inevitable death.\n\nOur own scientists have been toying with altering our own magical weapons to target specific aspects of ponies, although that has been prevented from going into production due to potentially damaging love supplies. However, the [EQS.GetAdjectiveCap] aggression and escalation have made it hard to stand aside as our soldiers perish in monstrous ways.\n\nFeldmarschall Trimmel has been bombarded with demands that the Heer respond to [EQS.GetLeader]'s brutal retaliation. While he has held them off for now, it is only a matter of time before the populace learns of what is happening on the front, and it would be best if we get ahead of the situation.\n\nAs much as it is regretful, there seems to be only one course of action.

It had the seal of the [FROM.GetLeader] and within, [FROM.GetLeader.GetSheHe] officially laid the case for [FROM.GetNameDef] to be annexed into the Empire proper. Due to its proximity to the Summer Islands and Spa Islands, as well as the southern peninsula, it seems unnecessary to have a separate administration when direct control from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will suffice. Additionally, the island's citizens have been pacified enough that we will soon be able to integrate them into Imperial society. There is no con to annexing them, but the benefit of an autonomous administration would allow for better development than distant control as well as more trust from the populace."

The transition from a rebellious populace to one of supreme loyalty was not missed, and she has promised further aid for continuing our government, so that we may continue to be a model colony of [FROM.GetNameDef].\n\nWhile this isn't the answer we desired, she has made clear that we shall remain a special autonomy in the [FROM.GetFaction], and has promised [ROOT.GetLeader] further powers to keep the citizens loyal to Harmony.

Inside the immaculate envelope, the Goddess has laid out simple instructions for [ROOT.GetLeader]. Our sovereignty is at an end. The South-East is a portion of [EQS.GetNameDef] proper, and will be reintegrated and returned to her own administration. We are requested to relenquish all military command for those she will send shortly. This is, after all, merely a formality.\n\nYet this renegs on our blessing that she provided before, when [ROOT.GetLeader] received previous instructions from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. We are not ones to defy the Goddess, but what if it's a mistake? We still have a chance to request autonomy, but it is up to [ROOT.GetLeader] to do so."

  solarreworked.528.d_b:0 "Although the response from [FROM.GetLeader] came quickly to our message, it was not what the Empress anticipated.

However, the letter that the Empress received has defied expectations. Although polite, [FROM.GetLeader] reminded the Empress of her agreement with [FROM.GetLeader.GetHerHim] and that she is betraying the trust and faith of hundreds of thousands of ponies who live in the South-East. [FROM.GetAjdectiveCap] troops have yet to stand down, and they appear to be mobilizing.

  solarreworked.600.t:0 "Sisters Reunited"
  solarreworked.600.d:0 ""Wake up, dearest sister."\n\nAs those words bounced around in Princess Luna's skull, she groaned and raised a wing to rub at her forehead. Everything felt like it was on fire, with her head especially throbbing like she had experienced what one of the simpler, mortal ponies would describe as a "killer hangover." However, aside from alicorns metabolizing alcohol far too quickly, effectively needing them to be drowned in it to see an effect, she never partook of more than a glass or two, anyway.\n\nWith a grunt, she attempted to move her wing again, and a heavy weight tugged back on it along with the clanking of chains. Slowly cracking her eyes open, she blinked away some of the bleariness in her mind and focused on the orange blob that was standing in front of her.\n\nNo, it wasn't a blob. It was—\n\nLuna's blood ran cold. Despite the heat in the room, she shivered a couple of times like she was left stranded in the Frozen North or on Mount Everhoof. However, her fear was hastily suppressed as she struggled to move on the cot that she now sensed she was lying upon. As she did, more chains rattled together. In front of her, her captor only chortled.\n\nWiping a tear from her eye, Daybreaker Sun tittered, "Oh, Lulu, you're ever so resistant." She flexed her wings. Perhaps it was to taunt her, perhaps it was really was just a stretch. Either way, Luna furrowed her brow. She didn't need to even test her magic to know that an inhibitor was slotted onto it.\n\n"Laugh, fiend," Luna hissed as she flattened her ears against her head. "We shall not give you the pleasure of seeing Us grovel for simply for your own amusement."\n\n"Oh, spoilsport," pouted Daybreaker in return. Puffing out her lips, she shot Luna a pensive frown and tilted her head. "Is that how you reunite with me? You don't want to acknowledge that you've been captured by a 'beast' or 'demon?'"\n\nLuna narrowed her eyes. Past Daybreaker, she could only see the corridors of the dungeons of wherever she was being held. Sunlight filtered in from a window behind where Luna lay. "We shall deign you with a response, lest you believe yourself the victor." She huffed. "You have accomplished little, whelp."\n\n"Such language!" Daybreaker scoffed. She inched closer to stand over Luna. Practically dripping with smarm, she stated, "Oh, but it'd be better if you just begged. Less fun, but better." Whirling on her hooves, she quipped, "But as you wish, Sister! We'll have plenty of time to catch up." She giggled. "Plenty of time.""
  solarreworked.600.a:0 "Does that sound good, sister dearest?"
  solarreworked.601.t:0 "Naivety on Display"
  solarreworked.601.d_a:0 ""Ugh, is there a reason we agreed to play friendship counselor instead of, I don't know, helping plan kicking Daybreaker's flank?" Rainbow Dash groaned seconds before she slammed a hoof on the cafe table. Everything on it jostled and jittered, spilling some coffee and tea onto the tablecloth. Despite Rarity's glare, she merely huffed and looked out the window as the sun barely crested the buildings of the city.\n\nAcross from her, Twilight Sparkle ruffled her feathers and gave her a look. By look, it was more accurately a seething glower that would have bored a hole through Dash's head if she could shoot magic from her eyes. Thankfully, though, she couldn't. Her horn would work just as well, though.\n\n"First, we're here to help creatures, even in exile. Second, that's my MENTOR you're talking about, and she's still in there." Twilight swallowed and glanced to the side. "I hope, anyway."\n\n"And we've gotten so far!" Dash snarled before Applejack rested a hoof on her shoulder. Shaking her head, Applejack wordlessly nodded to Twilight, who was biting her lip and slightly rocking in her seat. Dash sighed. "All right, fine. I guess I could use, uh, less angry words or whatever."\n\n"Er, yes, quite." Brushing back some of her mane, Rarity sipped daintily at her tea and then shot Dash a huff. "Perhaps you should simply watch while the rest of us help mend a relationship?"\n\nDash snorted, just as a bickering pair of ponies stomped their way inside. One of them, an ebony-colored mare, spotted Twilight and her group and marched up to them. "You're the stupid 'experts?'" the mare huffed.\n\nPlacing a hoof on her chest, Twilight smiled calmly and stated, "We were asked by your counselor to assist. Since we're here in—"\n\n"Don't care," interjected the mare, who shot a glower back at her companion. Said companion stuck out his tongue and the mare rolled her eyes. "Charred Beam," she retorted. Thrusting a hoof to the stallion, she grumped, "Light Step. Fix us if you can."\n\nAt that, Twilight shared a glance with her friends. Pinkie, who was staring out the window tiredly, suddenly jerked onto the floor with a thud. After a couple of seconds, she got up and muttered, "Huh, twitchy mane and jerky fetlock. Weird."\n\nAs she muttered that, Dash looked around as she caught the few patrons that were there that early in the morning at the cafe all depart or even sneak into the employee areas. Suddenly going tense, she hissed to Twilight what she spotted, but before Twilight could react, Light Step locked the door to the building.\n\nTwilight instantly prepared her horn, but Charred had already donned a gas mask and summoned a canister that was spewing a noxious mist. Although muffed, she quipped as she tossed the canister, "Mama Cita says 'Hello.'""
  solarreworked.601.d_b:0 ""Remind me why we're bothering with this when we have a friend to save?" Rainbow Dash whined as she flapped steadily beside Rarity, who simply shot her friend an annoyed glare. Dash quickly jabbed a hoof at the frazzled-looking counselor that was leading them toward a rundown apartment bloc.\n\n"'Cause we were asked to and we're still here to help ponies, er, creatures," interjected Applejack as she trotted past Dash. At that, Dash merely huffed and grumbled under her breath.\n\nThe building itself was nondescript, save for some chips on the bricks and some grime on a couple of the apartment windows. Given that it appeared about as innocuous as could be, Dash could only feel her frustration climbing further the longer that they took with this the less time it'd take to try and figure out a way to punch back at Daybreaker. Never mind that it had been more moons than she could bother to remember since they fled [EQS.GetNameDef].\n\n"I'm just saying that—" Dash never finished.\n\nAs soon as they stepped into the narrow entryway of the apartment, the counselor wished them luck and that the Elements really didn't have to help before leaving. When he did, Pinkie paused for a couple of seconds as some of her flat mane randomly twitched and she nearly launched herself onto the floor in a couple of convulsions.\n\n"Huh, twitchy mane and jerky fetlock," she mumbled. "Weird."\n\nBefore Dash or anypony else that was there could ask her the meaning, hoofbeats came hurriedly down the stairs. "And I'm telling you that—" an angry voice began before an ebony-colored mare with a scarf stomped down the stairs. "Oh," she blurted flatly. She stared at them. "Y-You must be the 'relational experts' that that shrink said he'd ask to help." She stuck out her tongue. "Fine, whatever. I'm Charred Beam, if you care at all about names."\n\n"Well, Miss Beam," Rarity declared as she stepped in front of Dash. "I, for one, would like to help in any way I can. After all, what are we doing here, if not to help?" At that, she shot a warning glare at Dash, who just shrugged defensively.\n\n"Yeah, yeah, whatever," Charred huffed as she turned to go back up the stairs.\n\n"Where's everycreature else?" Fluttershy finally muttered, earning a stare from Charred. "It seems awfully quiet in here. Not that I'm complaining."\n\nCharred smirked. "Well, when you put it that way, why don't we spice it up a bit?" Igniting her horn, she stated as a gas mask appeared on her head as well as a canister beginning to spew a noxious mist, "Mama Cita says 'Hello.'""

  solarreworked.602.d:0 ""So you've gone over everything?" Amber Ember hissed to the changeling escorting her. Even in the dim lighting of Chrysalis's palace, she could see him shiver and he looked back at her, his compound eyes glistening. Although it could just have been catching the reflection of the bioluminescent orbs through the halls, it looked a tad more like fear to her.\n\nThe guard rubbed its wings together subconsciously. Shortly, he finally chittered, "Y-Yes, I know what to do." He stared at her bonds. "Those will weaken with the ward cast on my hoof and then you'll 'break out.'" He snorted. "I just hope that Chrysalis is feeling confident today."\n\nFurrowing her brow, Amber caught a look of her reflection in a puddle as something liquid dribbled down from one of the rafters. "Hit me a couple of times," she quipped, which earned a frightened chirp from the guard. When he looked at her like she had lost her mind, she repeated, "I look too untouched for an important prisoner. Hit me."\n\nBriefly, the guard contemplated. With a whine, he wound up for a slamming a hoof into her jaw, but the doors to Chrysalis's throne room opened and he froze. Amber felt her heart drop and her temper flare. Chrysalis lazily lounged upon a black throne. There were no guards, save the two that opened the door and who quickly stood outside the throne room, but there was one Wehrmacht officer standing to one side inside.\n\nAmber shot her conspirator a nervous glance.\n\n"Oh, don't rough her up too much, not when there's so much fun we can have together," Chrysalis finally called in a coy tone. When Amber's escort hesitated, she snapped, "Bring her! Now! We'll pick every little detail from her pathetic pony brain." She glanced at the Wehrmacht officer. "Narcys here has was, don't you?"\n\n"Of course, my queen," Narcys replied with a bow.\n\nWith no recourse, the only option was to enter. Amber swallowed and her hooves felt like lead. As she got closer, her horn suddenly throbbed. She staggered, and Chrysalis smirked. "Does the little pony have a headache?" she cooed, venom dripping from her voice. She cackled. "Like my throne? Carved specifically to torment you swine."\n\nAmber briefly switched her attention from the throne to her escort's gun. The shortest of exchanges was held, and the guard gulped. Reaching for her side, ostensibly to shove her, his enchanted hoof made the chains holding her snap, and she lunged for his gun. Despite her pain, she held the pistol in her mouth worked the trigger with her tongue.\n\n"My queen!" she heard Narcys bellow as she fired. Before she could think, the magazine was empty and Narcys was on the floor in a pool of green blood. Chrysalis was holding a shoulder, but her magic was beginning to build.\n\nAmber cursed and bolted."

Have a little patience." As soon as the pony finished, Astrum suppressed a snort. It wasn't like they had been waiting for the past five hours, since the sun set and allowed Nightmare Moon's orb to replace it.\n\nWhen she voiced as such, she only got an order to be quiet. Flattening her ears against her head, she went back to tapping nervously on the ground. The camp was so tantalizingly close. She could even see a couple of the potential targets moving about. Why had—\n\n"Go!" her fellow S.M.I.L.E. agent, Goldenrod, declared, breaking Astrum from her thoughts. In the distance, some gunshots started to ring out, and the camp in the small woodland clearing went into overdrive. Most of the attention was focused in the direction of where the fighting appeared to be. Both ponies sprinted across the clearing, keeping as low as possible to avoid being noticed.\n\nAstrum barely held back a giggle as grass brushed against her stomach. Soon, though, they reached the previously observed weak section in the camp's perimeter fence, and Astrum focused her magic. Quickly, she bent the softer links in the fence and they slipped inside. As they ducked behind a large tent while some [NLR.GetAdjectiveCap] soldiers patrolled nearby, Astrum glanced at Goldenrod. She made a couple of motions toward ducking in the tent, and he nodded.\n\nIf intel was right, their targets would be here, anyway. If not, it'd still hopefully be a couple of officers that'd hinder Nightmare Moon's war effort.\n\nAs Goldenrod burst through the tent's entrance flap, Astrum raised as best she could one of the sections between pegs and scrambled through. Goldenrod quietly snapped as he held up a pistol at a couple of thestrals dressed in [NLR.GetAdjectiveCap] military uniforms gawked at him, "Scream, and you're dead. Charred, bind them." He flicked his eyes from Astrum to the thestrals, and Astrum nodded.\n\n"You know, though, we could just shoot them now," she suggested as she looped rope from a saddlebag she had around the torsos of both ponies.\n\nGoldenrod just sighed. "Why'd I get her assigned to me?" he mumbled as Astrum shot him a wink."

Behind bars, the kirin appeared practically like ponies, save the strange manes and horns. And also the scales. While it wasn't odd to see a few outside of the Kirian subcontinent, it was still interesting to see the differences.\n\nThe gentle thrum of the engines of the submarine in which they were returning to Empire provided a steady background that almost overwhelmed the soft question from the prisoners of where they were. However, Fahrenheit was close enough to catch it, and she quipped, "You're going to your new home where you'll be far more useful to the Empress than before."\n\nWith a shudder, the kirin that first woke whimpered and shied back from the bars. Grinning, Fahrenheit stated, "Surely you can't be that pathetic? Just roll over and play dead now that you'll never see your—"\n\n"Don't aggravate the test subjects, Fahrenheit," another pony mumbled as she trotted up next to Fahrenheit. Shooting Fahrenheit a tired glower, she added with a snort, "I don't think that this sub could handle all of them going nirik at once." She huffed. "Or one."\n\n"Please, Cold Shoulder, I know what I'm doing." With a glimmer of interest in her eyes, Fahrenheit returned to smiling at the kirin. Airily, she exclaimed as she pressed a hoof against the bars of the sub's small brig, "I'm simply fascinated how it all works. We didn't really have much time to think and watch while we were on the op."\n\nNickering, Cold Shoulder declared, "I'm warning you once, Fahrenheit. Don't."\n\nBlowing a raspberry, Fahrenheit returned to looking at the first kirin that woke. She inquired, "What's your name?"\n\n"Vermilion Wildfire." Wildfire cringed back further.\n\n"Well, Vermilion," Fahrenheit began with a chuckle, "how does it feel knowing you'll never be coming back?" Wildfire glanced at the floor. Pressing further, Fahrenheit added, "You'll never see your family again. Never feel the disgustingly tepid warmth of Kiria in her mane. Never—"\n\nThere was click of a safety being released. Cold Shoulder growled, "Fahrenheit."\n\n"I know what I'm doing, sheesh," replied Fahrenheit with a dismissive wave. Leering toward Wildfire, she added, "Your friends? Gone. Your home? Empty.

Fahrenheit jumped back as the metal started to glow and soften.\n\nBefore it could get further, there was a gunshot, and Wildfire staggered back. Then a dozen more followed.

From the dark brown color and how they had apparently run a tad after being scratched, she could only assume it was blood. Probably the blood of the many griffons that had been used as undead servants in the Dread League.\n\nShe glanced up at one of the mages who had been analyzing the spells contained within the repository that had been provided. From the haggard look to his face and the dark circles under his eyes, he'd been most likely up all week studying them. However, there was a wild, excited glow to his countenance that seemed to BLEED energy. It was, even to her, unnerving enough to make her shiver.\n\n"Oh, absolutely! If used on fresh bodies, they could probably be reanimated with no loss of mental ability." He tapped his chin. "Probably within half an hour. Enough that the cadaver is still warm."\n\nHumming, Daybreaker turned another page of the tome. She flicked one of her ears. In the distance, she swore that something was scratching on a wall, or whispering, but she pushed it out of her head. Tricks of ancient necromancers, no doubt. She instead moved to the next chapter. It was surprisingly, almost admirably simple. Just a few tweaks and it'd probably be able to be used instead of expensive medical spells. At least most of the time.\n\n"Most interesting," she mused, her mane flapping softly about and sending a couple of tiny blobs of flame onto the floor of her throne room. As they sizzled, she asked, "How certain are you of this?"\n\n"Completely! In fact, if you brought a couple of prisoners or rebels, I could—" Before he could finish, he screamed as a bolt of magic hit him in the chest and sent him tumbling to the floor. Seconds later, a pillar of fire engulfed him.\n\n"No need," Daybreaker replied with a smirk. Afterward, she frowned and concentrated, glancing briefly at the tome before engulfing the body in a fiery aura yet again. Watching as the magic on her horn died and the field remained, she gave a small gasp of joy when the corpse began to twisted and snap back into place, and shortly, the mage coughed and hacked before looking around wildly.\n\nHe was covered in soot, but alive.\n\nLooking at Daybreaker, he inquired, "I asked for that, didn't I?""

  solarreworked.606.d:0 "What silence there was within the capital of the Storm Kingdom was shattered when, through the wall of the dead tyrant's palace, four ponies burst through, an explosion following them immediately. Dust and debris trailed them as seconds later a number of yeti guards of [STM.GetLeader] charged after them, despite the large drop to the streets below.\n\n"Duck and roll!" the lead pony exclaimed as she braced for hitting the hard concrete of the yeti capital. She grunted as she impacted the ground, followed shortly by her compatriots. In one of the others' grasps, a simple staff with a single, blue crystal caught the glint of the sun. She glanced back at it. Within the gem, swirling energies could barely be discerned, like currents in a river.\n\nAs the group gathered its bearings, a few civilians stared at them in shock. All of them jumped when there were heavy thuds behind them. The lead mare, Mariposa Bloom, scrambled back and she dragged her companion carrying the staff with her. The other two followed suit. However, before they could make enough distance between them and the guards chasing them, there was a gunshot from where they had landed. Bullets started to whizz by, sounding like screams to Mariposa's ears.\n\nThe city was maze-like, but they had navigated it before. Charging her horn, she shot a bolt of energy at a couple of armed yeti coming around a bend in the road, in the direction of their escape. The creature yelped and jumped back, just as the bolt detonated on the ground an inch in front of him. It only took a moment for the other soldiers to clue in, and Mariposa cursed as more bullets joined the fray.\n\nAfter turning another corner, given that their planned route was forfeit, Mariposa skidded to a halt. It was a dead end. The little cul-de-sac of tightly-packed apartments and homes provided no way to flee. She turned, only to spot yeti bearing down on them. She swallowed. In the fracas, she hadn't caught that her partner, the one holding the staff, had been shot.\n\nCrimson pulsed down his shoulder and back, and he coughed a few times now that they had a second to catch their breath. She fixed her gaze on the staff. There was one thing she could try.\n\n"Give it to me," she demanded to her companion. When he hesitated and struggled, she snapped, "Now!" He passed it to her, and she looked at the gem again. The Staff of Sacanas. It could absorb magic, but also release it. And it was quite full right now.\n\nFocusing on it, she groaned when her left side suddenly screamed at her and she felt warm blood flow down her chest. She pushed through the initial shock, and mentally touched the well of magic inside the staff. She exhaled, and suddenly the rush of energy in her horn swallowed her.\n\nShe heard a pop, and then everything went white."

  solarreworked.610.d:0 "All of [ROOT.GetNameDef] is on alert as of one hour ago. Against all odds, our Queen has had an attempt made on her life, and there is only one creature who could be so cowardly and conniving enough to try and accomplish it. Details are still sparse around the exact nature of the failed assassination, but [ROOT.GetAgency] has reason to believe that some of the few remaining Thoraxists worked with [EQS.GetLeader] smuggle in the assailant.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] was found wounded from multiple gunshot wounds but alive. However, one of the Wehrmacht generals who had been requested by her for interrogating a prisoner was dead in the room with her. Witnesses report that a pony was the high-interest person from whom the Queen wished to gather information. However, with the work of [ROOT.GetAgency], it has been determined that many of these reports and statements indicating the assassin was in the upper echelons of S.M.I.L.E. appears to be fabricated, as the changelings ascribed to the reports do not appear to exist.\n\nCurrently, there has been no answer from [EQS.GetNameDef] regarding our demands for concessions. It is all too clear that they were the ones behind it, as our justified war with them continues to proceed according to the Queen's plan and they are becoming overwhelmed. This is obviously a desperate attempt to stymie our efforts, but they are fools if they believe we will be stopped.\n\nSince she was found, our Queen has been cared for by the best doctors in the hives, and she is expected to make a full recovery. Her injuries are still severe, though, and she will be bed-ridden for some time. With the spread of this news, our populace is rightfully infuriated. Volunteers to join the Wehrmacht has reached an all time high as our citizens wish to see the vile ponies punished for their brazen attempt on [ROOT.GetLeader].\n\nThe ponies may have hoped to break us, but they've only sealed our resolve and their fates."

However, there have been numerous, coordinated attacks on our fronts, but not from the expected sources.\n\nThe tactics of [EQS.GetNameDef] have appeared to begin adapting to the reality of this war, as they have started false flag attacks. Although this isn't entirely new, the most recent has indications of coordination by higher ups beyond just the military. At all hours of the day, various skirmishes broke out near camps of some of our more veteran officers who have followed the Empress. Across most of them, when the assaults are inevitably repelled, some of the commanders in the camp are nowhere to be found.\n\nScant evidence can be determined, but at one of the camp sites, a couple of ponies were discovered infiltrating it, and were repelled. Both were injured, but not captured or killed.\n\nIt can only be surmised that these latest false flag attacks were meant to distract from the operation in play. What has happened to the officers captured is unable to be determined, but they are most likely held in custody or interrogation now within [EQS.GetNameDef]. The Empress has condemned [EQS.GetLeader] as a craven dictator who must use guile to stand a chance against her righteous war. So far, there has been no response from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThese captures have thrown our officer corps into disarray, as many junior members have now been placed in command positions for which they were not prepared. Further training of replacements will take time. Until they are ready, we will be on the back hoof in any conflict with [EQS.GetLeader]."

  solarreworked.613.d:0 "This morning chaos broke in [ROOT.GetLeader]'s office when word arrived that the residence we had provided Princess Luna as asylum had been raided. At first the information was sparse and inconsistent, but over time, a plausible narrative has been created. It is no doubt an act by [EQS.GetNameDef] and [EQS.GetLeader], as [EQS.GetLeader.GetSheHe] has been making overtures about finding and finally putting an end to Luna's "rebellion."\n\nAlthough we believed that she'd be safe given that we screened all information coming into and out of her residence, somecreature's tongue must have slipped. Of witnesses who were leaned upon for the report from our intelligence agencies, it appears that [EQS.GetNameDef]'s agents infiltrated the compound over time, as a number of staff that had joined in the last half a year as rotation or other refugees loyal to Harmony have disappeared. It is too much of a coincidence that they all were taken with her, so it is therefore plausible they were involved if not the perpetrators themselves.\n\nFrom some hazy eyewitness accounts, a larger pony who looked like Luna was seen being escorted or hauled by a number of figures, but the location where this was encountered is not clear. Given the amount of time that's passed since her disappearance and the alarm, it's unlikely we will find her. Some search parties have been organized, but they are almost certain to turn up empty.\n\nUnless [EQS.GetLeader] parades Princess Luna in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] or makes her speak on the radio, what her fate has become may forever be unclear. We can only hope that she is safe and that she may carry Harmony's torch in the future."

Normally they would leave that to local resources and authorities, but it was apparently enough that they thought it wisest to help, if for no other reason than the optics to those involved.\n\nHowever, while they were seen meeting with one of the parties responsible for the rather heated conflict, it was presumed they'd be safe since it was in our capital and only a simple relational issue. Yet they never emerged after meeting with the one party. Local authorities eventually investigated and found the location where they went to be devoid of any inhabitants. They also found recently dug tunnels to another building across the street, which was also uninhabited. While they searched for a number of hours, they were unable to locate the Element Bearers.\n\nWhen word at last reached our intelligence community, they immediately organized parties and deployed as many of our agents as possible in scouring for them. Although they were not seen inside the city, there were a couple of citizens in rural areas that claimed to have seen them being taken toward the coast, but the trail was too cold by that time to find them.\n\nWe have been forced to call off the hunt, as it's clear that they have been taken. Although no nation has claimed responsibility, we can only assume that it's [EQS.GetNameDef], as [EQS.GetLeader] has blustered about the defiance of the Element Bearers and how they cling to a corruption of Harmony. If they were indeed kidnapped by [EQS.GetNameDef], then their fate may be dark. Only so much can be done, however, and we must prepare for the news that they have been dealt with by [EQS.GetLeader] any day."

  ###Agency Events###
  solarreworked.650.t_a:0 "S.M.I.L.E.'s Successor"
  solarreworked.650.t_b:0 "The Director Question"
  solarreworked.650.d_a:0 "As part of the regime change in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], all of the old institutions that once served the Empress are being phased out and replaced with more loyal programs. One of the most questionable in its effectiveness and dedication to the Empress was S.M.I.L.E., which was resurrected in the years leading up to the Empress's ascension.\n\nWhile S.M.I.L.E. was originally intended only for combating mythical creatures and legendary threats like those of Tirek or Cerberus, it was shuttered for a time when it failed to do even that. The last director before its most recent, Sweetie Drops, remained stuck in the previous century of thought, and when Sweetie Drops was given the role, she helped breathe fresh air into the agency. Since then, it has helped thwart a number of attempts at the Empress before she ascended and also from dangers to Harmony.\n\nYet it is not without its detractors.\n\nAs there were a number of traitors in S.M.I.L.E.'s midst, the Empress has wisely decreed that the agency should be shuttered and its assets seized. Many of the suspected rebels were arrested, tried, and found guilty. However, many are clearly faithful to the Empress and to Harmony and have been allowed to remain with S.M.I.L.E.'s successor, [SOLGetAgencyName].\n\nWith a new agency a new director is needed and there are only a few candidates that would have any merit. First is Director Sweetie Drops, as she has remained following the Empress and Harmony. Although she has agreed to continue serving if kept as director, there are some who claim that her heart is not truly in the work, and she has already put forward names of ponies whom she would be brought on to begin the task of building [SOLGetAgencyName]. Some of these are highly suspect.\n\nAnother possibility is one of our newer S.M.I.L.E. agents but one who has proven himself already in the field. A young stallion, Absconditus Lumen, has shown exceptional potential. He is highly adaptive and ambitious, and has already taken it upon himself to draft up potential implementations of various roles and departments within [SOLGetAgencyName] if he were to be chosen. Most of these concepts appear achievable and would greatly enhance our security.\n\nThe third possible candidate is another newer agent, Astrum Solus. Even to recruiters, she has remained somewhat mysterious. In ways, it's like she appeared in Equestria solely to assist us, as there is little history of her before her induction into S.M.I.L.E. As an excellent undercover agent, she has ideas for how to further our infiltration capabilities if she is chosen.\n\nAll three have offered to help, but there is only one director needed. Who shall it be?"
  solarreworked.650.d_b:0 "With Sweetie Drops' betrayal, it is clear that we should have never appointed her to begin with. Those that were recruited by her have either been arrested or are actively being hunted down by loyal agents to the Empress. It will only be a matter of time until they are found and punished for their crimes.\n\nSweetie Drops has disappeared, however, and regardless of her fate, [SOLGetAgencyName] is now once again rudderless. Both loyal candidates, Absconditus Lumen and Astrum Solus, have stated they still desire to lead. Absconditus would see our intelligence community grow ever larger and more efficient while Astrum would desire it to be undetectable to any and all threats to Harmony.\n\nThey have already sacrificed much and will do so again for the Empress. Betrayal is not in the cards with them. Whichever is chosen, they will ensure that [SOLGetAgencyName] will not fall to rebellion again. Which will the Empress deign worthy of leading it?"
  solarreworked.650.a:0 "Sweetie Drops has proven competent."

After all, who would believe themselves capable of standing against the might of the Sun itself? When you step out of your house, do you not feel the heat as it expresses its anger for all of your transgressions?\n\n"What are you talking about?" you may ask. Well, that is a fair question.\n\nHave you heard of what has happened to those who have defied the will of Harmony? What of those who believed that they fought for "freedom" or for "justice?" Do you see the foolish and the corrupt across the world be corrected and enlightened by Daybreaker, the Empress of Ponykind herself? Where are those that threatened her ponies and believed themselves superior to her power?\n\nYou may wonder what relevance this has. Listener, it can be assured that everything your leaders wish you to accept is a lie.\n\nDo they not appear nervous? What secrets have they withheld for the sake of "security" that could be used to keep you safe? Surely they must know that they're fighting in futility, do they not? As a mindless beast kicking against the pricks, they believe that they can stop the might of the Sun itself.\n\nThey believe they can defeat Daybreaker, Originator of Order and Harmony, Ponykind's Empress. They think they can overcome the one who has singlehoofedly guided her ponies to safety and protection for a thousand years.\n\nRemember that when the Empress marches into your town and reduces it to slag for your support of your misguided, corrupt leaders. Unless, of course, you accepted her will.\n\nFor the Empress isn't without mercy.\n\nLet these words serve a warning. The Empress will not be toyed with.\n\nShe will always serve justice."

Remember that the Empress always is behind you!\n\nEven though we have been abandoned by all who claim to stand for Harmony and friendship, she has remained steadfast to protect you! What danger are you in while you're under her wing?\n\nBut remember that it's not just the Empress that keeps Harmony safe. It is everypony who is guided by her. Perhaps the Crystal Ponies believe that they still hold true, but they have gone astray. What of the griffons across the sea? The Griffonian Republic claims that they are a blazing light of Harmony to all, but they are as lost as all those who reject the Empress's message.\n\nNo nation sees the truth as us, but that doesn't mean we despair. For Harmony to survive, we must band together and protect each and every one of us. If you see your neighbor struggling, speak with her to reminder her that the she must be more like the Empress. Even when she was betrayed on all sides when she revealed herself, she didn't falter. She bravely held to the truth so that we could be freed from the old, weak ways to be reborn strong and wise.\n\nSome of you may think the task is too great. If everycreature is against us, surely we will fall, will we not? That, dear listener, is what they wish for you to believe!\n\nWhen the thoughts of doubt creep in, look to the Empress. See how she's improved your life! You are safe, secure, and satisfied. Everything you need is provided by Order and Harmony. Why could you not then see how you must work for her? No matter how difficult it may appear, there is nothing that cannot be done for Harmony!\n\nStruggling with food? Remember it's for Harmony!\n\nWorrying about wars? Remember that Harmony and the Empress will protect us all.\n\nScared for the future? Don't forget that Harmony has ensured there will be a future.\n\nEverything is for her, and she is for everything. Let the Empress's strength give you the will to serve her. A faithful servant is a happy servant."

  solarreworked.653.d:0 ""You ready for this?" Light Blossom heard her lead operative, Astrum Solus, inquire of her as she finished fiddling with the safety on her pistol. After sliding the rack once to make sure that it would feed the ammunition, Astrum slipped it into a holster that was snugly tied to her flank. She quickly slipped into some casual clothing, which hid the holster perfectly.\n\nLight Blossom glanced between Astrum and the rest of the operatives gathered in the rather dingy building. Outside, she could hear the steady chanting of a slogan by a number of ponies, and she peered through a crack in one of the boarded windows of the abandoned business they were using. In the dusty glass, she spotted at least a hundred ponies gathered around one of the statues of the Empress, and her fur on her neck bristled instinctively.\n\nShooting a stern stare back at Astrum, Light nodded and hastily donned some more clothing much like what was worn by many of the protestors. Her horn sparked once as she mentally went over a couple of spells that could be used for the operation. When she was sure that they were memorized, she hissed at Astrum, "And you got approval for this? They're not exactly—"\n\n"Oi, I was the one who found the evidence, got it?" Astrum flattened her ears against her head. She jabbed a hoof at her chest. "If they're allowed to do this much longer, it'll get violent. I had it verified."\n\nLicking her lips, Light finally nodded and sighed. Facing the rest of the squad, she caught Astrum bark, "Okay, remember, keep it low until I make the first arrest. If ponies get feisty, well..." While she never finished, the statement carried enough weight that Light could pick up its meaning.\n\nNervously, she fumbled with the pistol she also had holstered, and she cleared her throat. On a count of three, Astrum slunk from the building and out in to the crowd. Over the course of a couple of minutes, so did the remaining agents. When Light slipped out, she instantly found herself wedged between a couple of shouting ponies, one carrying a sign in his magic.\n\nHeartbeat skyrocketing, she strained to see Astrum, who was going to the front, get up near the statue as it was being dunked with red paint, and watched the arrest unfold. Astrum reached for one of the painters, and Light caught snippets of the accusation, then as the pony tried to jerk away, she pulled her pistol.\n\nAs the gunshot cracked deafeningly, Light automatically took out hers. Before she could think, she pulled the trigger on the nearest pony, and she squeezed her eyes shut as blood splattered her.\n\nEmpress forgive her."

  solarreworked.654.d:0 "Panting and gasping, Quick Draw galloped through the stony corridor in which he had been left. Although he wasn't directly being followed, he could still feel himself being tracked, like eyes were watching him from every crack and crevice in the hallway's walls. Sweat poured down his forehead as he staggered to a stop to slow down and wheeze a few haggard breaths.\n\nMentally, he timed how long he spent struggling to fill his lungs, and after he hit a total of ten seconds, he started up again. His chest still ached and burned, and he shouldered the small, heavy object that was his target. A simple enchanted knickknack, but that wasn't the point. If he had questioned it, he would have, at best, been kicked out of the [SOLGetAgencyName] and at worst...\n\nHe shuddered.\n\nThere was a sudden crackle above his head, and he jumped out of the way as not only a bolt of lightning, fed by magic, hit where he had been, but somepony's voice broke onto the intercom system. "Not bad," the voice, a mare, declared after the speakers stopped squealing. "But you still need to think on your hooves."\n\nAs soon as she finished, there was a rumbling, and Quick Draw moaned as he caught the rattle of stonework shifting. After a few seconds, the hallway which he'd believed would take him out started to constrict. A wall steadily crept upward from the floor a few dozen meters in front of him.\n\nBefore he could even think, a jet of flame shot out behind him, and he dove to the ground. As it coursed overhead, he heard the voice state, "Pretty good, but you almost got torched. Pick it up. The Empress has, oh, twenty seconds left in her patience."\n\nAt that, his heart leapt into his chest, and he started to charge forward, keeping low to avoid the fire, and sped toward the ascending wall. It was about halfway up and he was still about twenty meters from it. Pouring as much energy he could into his legs, he felt as if they were a blur as he zoomed ahead. When he crossed an intersection with a couple of other corridors, there were cracks of bullets. One whizzed by his head, but he dodged it.\n\nThe mare on the speakers started to count down from five, and his vision began to swim as his lungs begged for more air. There was just enough room to squeeze in if he high jumped and—\n\nSpringing like a jack-in-the-box, he dove for the tight gap left by the wall, and he barely slipped through. Almost instantly, it slammed shut behind him, and he tumbled to the floor, exhausted. There were some hoofbeats, and he heard the same mare chuckle at him.\n\nLeaning down, Astrum Solus glanced at him and muttered, "Hey, you got out with a second to spare." She patted him on the head.

It was a tinkling crash of glass, and then rapid hoofbeats, ones which were still charging up the staircase toward her. Before she could fully register the intruders' intentions, her bedroom door burst open, and she screamed, pulling herself up as a number of ponies dressed in military uniform barged in, followed by a couple of plain clothed ponies.\n\nAll the soldiers aimed their rifles at her, and she stammered and stuttered in shock. Just as quickly as they had arrived, one of the non-military ponies whipped out hoofcuffs, which he jammed her forehooves into with barely a struggle. As her heartbeat started to slow down a tad at the surprise, she stammered out, "W-What's going on here?! W-Who are—"\n\nBriefly swiping a forehoof on the window sill of Inkling's bedroom, the other civilian-attired pony shook her head. Clicking her tongue, she stated, "You're quite demanding for somepony who'll break the Empress's trust."\n\nInkling blinked. "What?!" she finally demanded, straining at her cuffs a tad. "I-I organize the local Imperial Tots program! I'm as loyal as—"\n\n"Ah, but are you?" the other civilian interjected. Finally, he huffed and pulled out of his clothes' front pocket a badge and stated, "Clean Scry, [SOLGetAgencyName]. That's my partner, Premonition." He nodded at the civilian mare. Holding up a hoof, he stated, "Now, you're probably wondering, 'what's the [SOLGetAgencyName] doing at my house?' Well, it's simple." For a second, there was a pause, and he added, "You're a traitor."\n\n"B-But I'm not! I—"\n\n"Remembering the old days?" Premonition inquired as she held up a dusty calendar from before the Empress's ascension. When Inkling winced, she added, "Oh, and what about those old stories you tell your tots that you so faithfully look after for your neighbors?"Stepping closer, Premonition snapped, "And then your words last week about how the price of hay was better before the Empress? Hmm?"\n\n"I was only expression frustration..." Inkling wilted, slightly, before their prying glares.\n\nSpinning around, Premonition declared to the soldiers, "Right! Take her away!

At least, that was always Astrum Solus's impression during her many travels for the Empress. She brushed aside some of her mane as she stepped off the boat that had carried her to [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. She inhaled.\n\nCompared to the home of the Empress's, this city smelled fresh, but tainted. So many creatures living without the enlightenment that the Empress provided. If only they'd accept her without bloodshed.\n\nHuffing, Astrum furrowed her brow and pushed the thought from her head. They'd all bow in time. That wasn't what she was here for.\n\nAfter grabbing her luggage in her magic and strutting out onto the street, she waltzed only a block or so when she stepped into a side street and waited, ostensibly to get something out of her bags. Within seconds, she heard hoofbeats on pavement, and she glanced up to see a pair of ponies headed her way. With a grin, she quipped, "Hey, isn't it a bit blazing hot today?"\n\n"Yeah, but it's going to be a real firestorm tomorrow," one of the ponies answered, and Astrum nodded her head. They approached, and the one who responded stated, "Charred."\n\n"Sleet," Astrum responded with a similar level of seriousness. Regardless, she couldn't help but let a smidgen of excitement slip into her tone. She practically danced back and forth on her hooves as she asked, "Everything in order? Started making 'friends' here?"\n\nSleet grinned. Of course, not his actual name, but on the job, nopony could hear their real ones. "Absolutely. There's no possible way that our fuss won't get their attention once it starts." With a spark of glee in his eyes, he added, "And then the largest thorn in the Empress's flank—pardon the term—will be gone."\n\nAs a couple of pedestrians waltzed by, Astrum quickly slipped into a conversation about the news of Griffonia. When they were alone, she slunk further back into the side street, followed by the two agents, and quipped, "Oi, but if they resist, at least let me shoot them this time." Pouting faintly, she added, "Or at least threaten them with being shot? They ruined my perfect record last time."\n\nWith a nicker, Sleet merely approached her and muttered, "Maybe we can work that into the act, somehow. Drive up the drama."\n\nAstrum chuckled. "So long as there's a couple of real bullets, consider me on board.""

  solarreworked.657.d:0 "Calmly swinging the doors to the command and control center deep within [SOLGetAgencyName], Daybreaker trotted with a small swagger to her step, catching the eyes of at least a few ponies who were rushing between different charts and maps. A couple of automated computing machines regurgitated paper, which some ponies decked in lab coats busily scribbled down.\n\nDespite the ponies' apparent business, she could sense that they were all paying attention to her. After all, it was hard not to. Ignoring that she was their Empress, her mane alone cast more light in the underground room than any of the spells that had been cast on sconces on the walls. Waves of heat practically washed off of her as she moved closer to the center of the room.\n\nLooking over more maps, a younger stallion, dressed in a dapper shirt, glanced up and then bowed. "Your Majesty," he stated with slight awe. "I didn't expect you so soon. I only sent word an hour ago."\n\n"So you've finally found her, have you?" Daybreaker stated without answering his implied question. Without waiting for him to gesture her over, she began to pour over the maps that he had been. Compared to the country and continents that were on the wall, these ones were smaller in scale. However, markings on them indicated where Luna's residence had been determined, and notes beside who would do what to infiltrate had already been written down.\n\nShe smirked. Staring back at the stallion, she stated, "You've done rather well for yourself." She blinked briefly.\n\nAt Daybreaker's pause, the stallion quickly interjected, "Absconditus Lumen, my Empress. A humble servant." With that, he bowed again and Daybreaker chuckled.\n\n"You've learned the art of genuflecting quite well, Abscondtitus," mused Daybreaker as she returned to the map. "The plans are in motion? When will your agents move? She will not be expecting something this time, no?" When she finished, her mane flared a brighter orange.\n\n"I cannot say on the latter, my Empress, but I've already instructed the team on their mission." There was shimmer of anticipation in his eyes and he pressed both his forehooves onto the table. Pointing to a couple of locations on one of the maps, he stated, "They will intercept the company there and if not then at the fallback. After that..."\n\nAs he trailed off, Daybreaker cackled. "After that, they'll sweep little Lulu out and she'll be out of my mane forever." With a sinister snicker, she declared, "I think it may call for a little reunion when she's back here. Can't let her not feel loved by her sister, after all!""

  equestriaexpanded.1.t:0 "Director in Control"
  equestriaexpanded.1.d:0 ""Agent Sweetie Drops, reporting as ordered, Princess." Saluting and standing straight at attention, Sweetie Drops stared past Princess Celestia, who was pacing her throne room, and patiently counted to ten while Celestia continued to visibly fuss. When Celestia didn't appear to respond to her announcement, Sweetie cleared her throat. Surprisingly, there were no guards with the Princess. In fact, there was nopony else in the room at all.\n\nGranted, it was later than she presumed Celestia to serve in her role, but shouldn't there have been some ponies of the Night Court, or at least Princess Luna there, too?\n\nHer confusion must have been visible, as Celestia did glance up from the small laps and immediately stated, "Luna has been preoccupied with the war effort. Night Court is suspended until further notice." She ruffled her wing feathers. "That's why I asked for you to come here, Agent Drops."\n\n"What do you—"\n\n"How have you been?" Celestia interjected before Sweetie could finish her question. At the inquiry, Sweetie stammered and pulled back slightly as her brain processed the entirely mundane thought.\n\n"Uh... I've been... fine?" she finally declared, her shock palpable. Shaking her head, she opened her mouth to add something else, but Celestia cut her off again.\n\n"And your friends? They are well, too? Not—" she licked her lips "—too worried about the war?" When Sweetie scrutinized her, she nickered uneasily and glanced aside, out one of the windows. The muted moonlight allowed the stained glass to cast weak beams of colored light across the floor, which were cut up by the glow of the torch sconces on the pillars.\n\n"I'm sorry, Princess, but did you ask for me, making it sound like a national emergency, just to make SMALL TALK with me?!" Sweetie whinnied. Sputtering as her mind attempted to form coherent words, she caught Celestia sigh and hang her head.\n\nAfter a moment, Celestia flatly replied, "No. I didn't. I... wished to speak to you about a different matter." Sweetie arched an eyebrow. Gulping audibly, Celestia proclaimed, "S.M.I.L.E.'s previous director... wasn't willing to modernize the agency." She nodded to Sweetie. "I know that you agree."\n\n"Not just me," Sweetie interrupted with a huff.\n\n"Yes, but from all reports, you have what's needed." Celestia breathed deeply. "That's why I'm appointing you as the new director, if you would have it." Shifting uneasily on her hooves, she added, "I know it's much to ask, but my ponies and Harmony must be kept safe, and... I don't believe it would be accomplished under anypony else."\n\nSweetie worked her jaw. Then she bowed."
  equestriaexpanded.1.a:0 "I'll do it, so long as you think I'm able."
  equestriaexpanded.2.t:0 "Better than a Changeling"
  equestriaexpanded.2.d:0 "Emerald Coast leaned back against one of the walls of the alleyway, rubbing one of her forehooves on her chest as she lazily observed some of the passersby on the street. While she was not too far into the side street, the shadows cast by the buildings across the alley were enough to obscure her from casual notice, yet remain obvious for anypony who was searching for her.\n\nIn the back of her mind, she started playing a dozen different scenarios that could unfold in the next few minutes. If she was stood up, she'd have to return in shame but at least no worse for wear. If her contact had been compromised, then she could easily have some kind of fight on her hooves. Everything in between those extremes were also equally viable.\n\nOr she could have a normal meeting. But that was unlikely.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by and the dampness of the brick against her back started to seep into her fur, she snorted and fell back onto all her hooves with a heavy series of clops. However, before she headed out when the coast was clear, a cream-colored mare with a mane so dark blue it was almost black trotted in. They both exchanged nods.\n\n"Emerald Coast?" the mare asked without a hint of emotion. When Emerald affirmed as much, she added, "Calisson." She snorted. "Now, pleasantries aside, you sure you weren't followed?" Another agreement from Emerald, and Calisson huffed, "Fine. So, why do you want to join the Red Hooves?" She squinted suspiciously.\n\nAt that, Emerald swallowed briefly and she stated, "Well, I first learned about them when was fired from my mining job." With a small scowl, she grumped, "All because I requisitioned a couple of gems that were low grade. Wouldn't have made me many bits!" For a brief moment, Calisson studied her, then motioned for her to continue.\n\nLike a wave, nausea started to build in Emerald's stomach, but she forced it down whilst propping herself back up against the wall. Maintain composure, and all that. Appear completely at ease.\n\nShe smirked and stated, "So, I got in contact with one of your fences in the lower levels of Canterlot, and maybe... convinced him to arrange this, so that—"\n\n"And then you're dead," Calisson interjected, darting forward to lightly press a hoof right over Emerald's heart. With a sigh, she quipped, "Okay, close, Ruby, but if you're going to drop a fence, you better know the name and you BETTER have done some of that roughing up." Rotating a forehoof on its fetlock, she marched out and declared, "Go back to HQ and craft a new identity; this time, make sure you know it INSIDE and OUT."\n\nRuby Shore groaned. Hanging her head, she muttered, "Yes, Director Drops.""
  equestriaexpanded.2.a:0 "All for the double life."
  equestriaexpanded.3.t:0 "Moon or Bust"
  equestriaexpanded.3.d:0 "Entering the room was like stepping into a sauna, as the air was so thick and soupy with tension that it instantly made Celestia's forehead break out into a sweat. Gathered around the central map table in the planning room, three of the higher-ranking officers in the Equestrian Military stood hunched over, staring at the lines on the map spanning the eastern half of Equestria. Additionally, one of the newer, vetted agents of S.M.I.L.E., Night Orchid, a thestral, was standing to the side, watching them all.\n\nWhen Celestia closed the door behind her, Night Orchid stepped forward and bowed. "Thank you for coming, Princess," he greeted with a slight reverence to his voice. Likewise, the three officers saluted, and Celestia nodded at them. The only one she recognized was Grimhoof; the others, she inferred based on their uniforms. As Night Orchid rose, he declared, "We won't take up much of your time."\n\nLetting out an uneasy chuckle, Celestia went to the head of the table. "You made it sound like there was something important. I'll always make time if it means protecting my little ponies."\n\nThe agent and officers exchanged glances. In the ensuing silence, a pin could easily have been heard dropping. Each second slipped by, and Celestia started to feel her heart begin to thump against her chest. As Night Orchid was about to speak, she frantically inquired, "This isn't about something meant for Luna, is it?!"\n\nOrchid blinked. "Absolutely not, Princess!" Gesturing to the moon outside through the window in the back of the room, he added, "I know how much you love your sister, and I wish nothing more than to see her restored. But..." He sighed. "I have come to some of the high command about an idea. Something that would give us an advantage."\n\nBefore Celestia could interject, he told her everything. As the details expanded, her heart sunk and her mind raced. Kidnap, possibly harm, or even take out, some of HER ponies?! They were misguided, yes. Deceived, even. Yet to approve ambushes and false information to lure them into those ambushes? It was—\n\nShe stopped. Her ponies were already fighting, sister against sister, mother against daughter. Was this much different?\n\nSwitching her gaze between the assembled officers and Night Orchid, she finally swallowed and got up. She marched toward the door. With one, tear-stained glance back, she could only say one thing. "You have approval.""
  equestriaexpanded.3.a:0 "I just don't want to know what happens."
  equestriaexpanded.4.t:0 "Know Your Changeling!"
  equestriaexpanded.4.d:0 "Changelings. That word alone strikes fear into the hearts of ponies across Equestria, but now you're taking the first step in living just like those bugs! This field guide is based on observations by multiple agents in the field, as well as research by the esteemed Canterlot Institute of Sapieology, foremost in knowledge of changelings and other creatures across the world.\n\nThe prospective S.M.I.L.E. agent may believe that in order to act like a changeling, one must be as cruel and heartless as possible. While sometimes true—changelings after all are a race that lacks a heart—that is not always the case. Changeling society has been seen as quite communal, as they use a hive concept in large gatherings. Breaking into this hive and being accepted is the most challenging part.\n\nAs there will be undoubtedly thousands of changelings flooding into Equestria in the case of war, knowing how to fit in with the crowd, so to speak, is of utmost importance while behind enemy lines. They will most likely use their vile magic to disguise themselves as ponies who once lived in the cities they occupy, and most likely will use it as part of their military police force. Therefore, if you believe you are ever in the presence of a changeling, know how to throw off their trail.\n\nChangelings can take on many forms, and they do gain the natural strength of anything they shape-shift into, but any innate magic does not. Additionally, they do not frequently study their targets, as they are much too busy sucking the love of their victim dry than learning the ins and outs of the victim's life. Knowing this can be advantageous.\n\nIf questioned by a pony who seems off, simply act like you know nothing of what they speak. Prodding personal questions? Shrug. Inquiries about your romantic life? Wonder if you even have a partner or spouse.\n\nPretending to be clueless is easy. More difficult is mimicking their lack of magic. Unicorn agents will have the simplest task. A changeling's magic's color never adapts to the disguise, and is always a sickly green, much like the nauseating nature of their kind. Unicorns must only cast an alteration spell on their magic's field to this same color, and the changeling will be none the wiser. Pegasi must strive to make their wings buzz, if at all possible. Earth ponies must never reveal their magical strength.\n\nIn the following seventy chapters, you will find diagrams on changeling weaknesses, as well as discussions on their ability to reason, as well as useful notes and suggestions on how to properly capture, imprison, or dissect one."
  equestriaexpanded.4.a:0 "I never knew!"
  equestriaexpanded.5.t:0 "Moths to a Flame"
  equestriaexpanded.5.d:0 "Pressing her head into her forehooves, Princess Celestia sighed as she massaged her temples as best she could. Everything hurt. How long had she even been awake? Twenty hours? Thirty? Forty? Did it even matter at that point?\n\nShe blinked a couple of times. After wiping her eyes, she felt a twinge of the bleariness that clouded her vision fade, and she cracked her neck as she pushed back from her office's desk. Sunlight peeked through her balcony's banisters. As its golden glow gently caressed the marble on the wall, she arched a brow. Had she even raised the sun? Had Twilight—\n\nBefore she could finish her thought, there was a burst of magic in front of her and a multi-paged binder flopped onto her desk. She nickered. On its front page, somepony had stamped a seal of approval from S.M.I.L.E. as well as a warning for being her eyes only. She frowned and scrunched her muzzle.\n\nAs she flipped open the report, she skimmed across it, her attention stopping only when she got to the third page. Her stomach lurched. Almost immediately, the headache that had been polite enough to depart decided to welcome itself back in, rent free, to her head. Swallowing a couple of times, she hastily zipped through the previous pages, rereading the contents, and as she did, her breath began to come in shallow gasps.\n\nIt was a simple operation outline. Normally, not an issue. Except this one.\n\nIn bold font along the main section of the third page, the single sentence that had set her off screamed for her to look at it again. ENDING CHRYSALIS'S THREAT, she read. What followed were maps of what was believed to be [251.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s layout of Chrysalis's palace. Timeline's of contacts and assistance from the few Thoraxian resistance members indicated one thing. This had been extremely thought-out. Not just a simple, theoretical idea like had been floated before.\n\nLetting the binder drop, Celestia gawked, blankly, at the door to her office. Nopony was there, but she seemed to stare right through it, off into space. Her mind, all the while, raced. Scenarios and ideas of what could happen danced through her head, and she went back to gazing at the report. Its words didn't change.\n\nIt still desired her approval.\n\nQuivering, Celestia looked back up and whimpered. Chrysalis had killed so many of her ponies already, but could Celestia take justice into her own hooves when a proper trial was more in order? As that thought zipped through her, she closed her eyes. The tallies of the dead danced in her imagination.\n\nWhen she stared at the report again, her decision had been made. She slammed an inked hoof onto the paper. "Approved," she grumbled to herself."
  equestriaexpanded.5.a:0 "This better not backfire..."
  equestriaexpanded.6.t:0 "Disloyalty Behind Smiles"
  equestriaexpanded.6.d:0 "There are multiple ways that a pony can serve Harmony and the Empress, and before the Empress ascended, one of those paths was to take on the cowl of an infiltrator, seeking to remain unnoticed while protecting ponies from the shadows. Although the agency, S.M.I.L.E., was not originally created as an intelligence agency, rather as a ward against mythical beasts and high-value, magical assets, it was what it became.\n\nShortly before the Empress's unveiling, S.M.I.L.E. was provided increased funding to revitalize it for threats against Harmony, and a new director was given control of it to oversee further modernization. Since then, Director Sweetie Drops has made the agency capable and there have been an unknown number of undercover attempts at destabilizing us that have been thwarted because of them.\n\nHowever, many of the agents recruited by Director Drops and the director herself are loyalists to the old regime. Director Drops especially has been vocal in her dissent against some of the Empress's decisions. She has kept to her oath to protect Harmony thus far, but her loyalty remains suspect. At times, she is unreachable when she should be still within the agency's headquarters. She has disappeared before on multiple occasions, although usually reappearing with an excuse of an emergency field operation that needed her attention.\n\nAs she was the one who recruited many of S.M.I.L.E.'s current crop of agents, she has the trust and respect of many within the agency. If she were to turn, ponies on the fence on following the Empress may fall away. She is clearly a potential threat, and with S.M.I.L.E. under her control, the entire organization could be corrupt to the core. Only through a purging of it and replacing it with something new when the time is right can we be sure that the Empress will be safe from all underhoofed dangers.\n\nHowever, we would also lose valuable experience, and a director is not so easily replaced. A choice must be made, but it is ultimately the Empress's to decide."

  equestriaexpanded.7.t:0 "Rejecting the Light"
  equestriaexpanded.7.d:0 "Fondling the explosives that were in her knapsack, Peach Fuzz slipped into the shadows cast by the wall of the research compound. Harsh beams of yellow light flooded overhead from the spotlights that were attached to one of the production facilities for whatever prototypes were in development; they cut into the darkness like daggers. After waiting a few seconds, she motioned with a hoof in the direction of some trees, and a couple more ponies galloped to her position.\n\nThey both slipped right up to the wall, making nary a sound. With only a couple of light pants, they nodded at her, and then Peach opened the sack. She quickly tossed them both uniforms, while she donned a janitorial outfit. Shortly, after wrapping the now significantly smaller bag to be tight around her stomach, she wordlessly gestured to the compound, and the three of them scaled the wall.\n\nLanding on the other side with light thuds, she heard Soft Touch, to her left, mutter, "We could have just walked through the front door, you know."\n\n"And avoid having any fun?" Peach quipped back. With a small titter, she added, "If I had thought you'd be a party pooper just because we're doing the right thing, I'd not have brought you along."\n\n"Hey, I'm just as on board with toppling Daybreaker as anypony, but maybe if we're supposed to be in disguise, we act casual? Don't tip off anypony?" Soft frowned, her light mane glistening in the light from the factory.\n\n"Who?" Tunnel Vision asked as he gestured to indicate the empty compound. "Just as empty as we scoped it out. Probably that nutjob thinks that it's safe, since it's so far behind the 'Empire's' front lines." He stuck out his tongue.\n\n"Cut the chatter," huffed Peach as she started to move toward the facility. "Remember your roles."\n\nSauntering confidently inside the factory, Peach only briefly let out a small gasp at the sheer size of the production floor. Scattered around it were various skeletons of different tank chassis, along with plates and half-built turrets. As soon as they entered, a single guard who was inside an open-air station looked up from his book.\n\n"Hey, do you have—Oh." He shrugged. "You're the cleanup mare?" Pointing back toward the floor, he stated, "The spill is just on line seven. Should see it easily."\n\n"Thanks." Peach moved closer and she paused, momentarily eyeing him up. He brushed his mane subconsciously. With a smirk, she inquired, "Say, could I ask you something?"\n\n"Sure."\n\nLeaning in, she cooed, "How's it feel when I do this?" At that, she suddenly jabbed out her forehooves, and both connected with his throat. He went down in a spasm fit, and she motioned for her two companions. "Throw him somewhere. Let me get to work." She grinned. "It won't take long to rig this to blow.""
  equestriaexpanded.7.a:0 "Damn them!"
  equestriaexpanded.8.t:0 "End of the Line"
  equestriaexpanded.8.d:0 ""That escalated quickly," Absconditus Lumen muttered to himself as a bullet whizzed over his head. Going to his knees and skidding into cover behind a low, concrete wall, he pushed his glasses back up his nose and counted to five. After that, he quickly poked his gun over with his magic and pulled the trigger. Didn't expect to hit anything, but had to at least make it look like he was pinned down there.\n\nFinding the three responsible for the sabotage of the Steel Hoof facility was almost laughably simple. Given that the facility in question had been both understaffed and underutilized, it hadn't been difficult to determine who had been there who shouldn't. It was almost as if they had wanted to be found.\n\nSilently, he mused that perhaps they did.\n\nLike it had been worried about, accepting the former S.M.I.L.E. agents into the Empress's ranks had been a mistake. Sweetie Drops had gone to ground, and was unlikely to ever be found. Of course, unless she wanted to be. However, her betrayal was less of a concern than the immediate, life-threatening one.\n\nWith a sigh, he called out after a lull in the sporadic gunfire. "You do realize that there's no way out, yes?" He got no response, but that was far from surprising. Scraping a hoof against the ground and pulling up a bit of gravel, he inspected it and then flicked it over the edge of his cover. "You could either come of this alive or unrecognizable, your choice."\n\nCounting down the seconds, he smirked when a mare responded, "Oh, that's such an offer! I doubt you'll let us live long if we come out waving the white flag."\n\nHe got a small jolt from the tether spell that he had tied to him. His partner was in position. With a smile, he called out, "Come now, we don't have to be rude. If you help me with the locations of your other traitors, I'll do what I can to argue leniency." He shrugged and hummed. "Probably a blindfold for the firing squad."\n\nIn response, there was another barrage of bullets, and he sighed. "If that's what you wish."\n\nBriefly sending a small spark of magic through the tether spell, he got up, almost nonchalantly, to let off a couple of shots and cast a shield as the cornered traitors returned fire. Before they could get off more than half a dozen bullets, there was a bang followed by some shrieks, then silence.\n\nAbsconditus smiled. Casually trotting over the construction yard he'd cornered the S.M.I.L.E. agents in, he called, "Had your fun, Charred?"\n\n"Ey! This one had a nice necklace on her! Think I'll keep it!" came a bubbly voice from inside.\n\nAbsconditus simply smirked. Another job well done."
  equestriaexpanded.8.a:0 "But who'll take over now?"
