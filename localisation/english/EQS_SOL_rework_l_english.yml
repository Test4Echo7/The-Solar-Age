  EQS_sanity_bop_desc:0 "In the changing world, an alicorn must adapt to the necessities of the modern ethos. Princess Celestia has led the nation of Equestria for a thousand years, and in that time she has seen kingdoms rise and fall, villains conquer and be conquered, and technology approach the levels of magic. In these dark times of turbulent war, it falls to her and her alone to shoulder this responsibility and make the difficult decisions for the good of Equestria. However, not even an immortal alicorn is safe from the burdens of war..."

Dissent within the ranks is unacceptable, and it's time that these thorns disappear."

Since the Empress ascended, there have been no games held, and her subjects have begun to clamor for another. If she grants their wish, it shall be the last, since the antiquated mindset has no place in the Solar Empire and should be replaced."

  ###Decisions###
  EQS_solar_fury_category:0 "An Alicorn's §OFury§!"
  EQS_solar_fury_category_desc:0 "It is a dreadful thing to corner an alicorn.\n\nOur enemies know not what they §Rsow§!."
  EQS_fury_of_sun:0 "§RUnleash the Power of the Sun!§!"
  EQS_fury_of_sun_desc:0 "The enemy is at our gates, but we are not without support. Our Empress guides our armies in the heat of battle, and she is capable of destroying entire armies without our aid. If she were to unleash that power, all those that threaten us would fall like dead grass in her wake!"
  EQS_become_daybreaker_bop:0 "§RAscend§!"
  EQS_become_daybreaker_bop_desc:0 "The enemy is at our gates. Ponies perish. [EQS.GetNameDef] is collapsing. Salvation is near, but my ponies must be §Rready§!.\n\nThey [GetCelestiasBopPopularSupport]."
  EQS_CelestiasPopularSupport_max_evil_bop:0 "§Rwill follow me into the gates of Tartarus§!"
  EQS_militias_desc:0 "War has not touched [ROOT.GetNameDef] for centuries. Although the government has the power to institute hard drafts of the populace in times of crisis, this power has never been utilized since it was signed into law, and mmost ponies would be hard-pressed to comply with letters of drafting. However, our ponies deeply love our country, and if we continue to suffer losses on the front, it may be enough to motivate them to join if the desperate hour arises."
  EQS_melt_our_foes:0 "Melt our Foes"
  EQS_pierce_the_heart:0 "Pierce the Enemy's Hearts"
  EQS_endless_service:0 "Death is not the End"
  EQS_invincible_soldiers:0 "Undying Service"
  SOL_societal_unrest:0 "Solidify Control"
  SOL_societal_unrest_desc:0 "Our new regime is a tenuous one. Few ponies currently would follow Daybreaker's lead, and it is clear to all that Celestia is gone. If actions are not implemented swiftly to crack down on dissent and silence the harshest critics, any chance of saving them from themselves will be lost and there could very well be a new war on our hooves."
  SOL_investigate_ponyville:0 "Investigate Ponyville's Castle"
  SOL_investigate_ponyville_desc:0 "Although Daybreaker's regime is now absolute, not everypony follows her completely. In alleyways and backrooms, many still believe that they must "free" Equestria from her reign. After a series of arrests in Manehattan from a series of organized strikes and one damaged factory, [ROOT.GetAgency] has learned that Starlight Glimmer, former friendship student of Twilight Sparkle, is involved with the Resistance. Although she has gone to ground, we must start somewhere, and that somewhere is Twilight Sparkle's former home: the Castle of Friendship."
  SOL_follow_fillydelphia_lead:0 "Follow Leads to Fillydelphia"
  SOL_follow_fillydelphia_lead_desc:0 "The clues found in Ponyville point to Starlight and Trixie spending some time in Fillydelphia, and there is a narrow list of places which they could have attended. Fillydelphia has been pacified, so it should not take long to find with whom they were going to meet."
  SOL_raid_ponyville_cottage:0 "Raid Old Ponyville Cottage"
  SOL_raid_ponyville_cottage_desc:0 "On the edge of Ponyville, there is a cottage that is almost within the Everfree Forest. Evidence obtained while searching the Castle of Friendship points to Starlight and Trixie going there to meet with a supplier. As it is abandoned and surrounded by hostile wildlife, there could be stashes of equipment, and perhaps an indication of where they went to next."
  SOL_raid_freeside_restaurant:0 "Raid Restaurant in Freeside"
  SOL_raid_freeside_restaurant_desc:0 "The information obtained in Fillydelphia points to a restuarant in Summerfield as a front for some Resistance members to meet and plan further insurrection. The proprieter is obviously complicit, and may very well know more of the whereabouts of further Resistance members, and perhaps the two public enemies, as well."
  SOL_investigate_new_horseleans_docks:0 "Investigate New Horseleans Docks"
  SOL_investigate_new_horseleans_docks_desc:0 "Although the Freeside information is scarce, there were a couple of letters between a Daffodil Drop and another member of the Resistance, which indicates that there is an information network within New Horseleans and that the dockyards are generally where Daffodil meets with her contacts. Scouring will take time, but capturing her alive will be well worth it."
  SOL_investigate_dead_drop:0 "Investigate Manehattan Dead Drop"
  SOL_investigate_dead_drop_desc:0 "The evidence found points to Manehattan being a frequent nexus of Resistance members exchanging information, which is not surprising given the extremely well-organized nature that most activity in that region experiences. Although we do not have a member for whom we can search, there is a location of a dead drop, as it recently changed, which gives us the perfect location to wait for a member to come looking for a communique."
  SOL_search_jungle_camp:0 "Search Abandoned Jungle Camp"
  SOL_search_jungle_camp_desc:0 "From what we have been able to gather through witnesses and searching the few possessions Daffodil Drop had, there appears to have been an encampent outside of New Horseleans where a number of Resistance members cooridnated some future attacks. Given how long it took us to find the information, it is unlikely we can catch anypony in the act, but there are bound to be clues that can be discovered."
  SOL_search_manehattan_opera_house:0 "Scour Manehattan Opera House"
  SOL_search_manehattan_opera_house_desc:0 "There was little to be gained from camping the dead drop, but after speaking to one pony, we learned that Trixie Lulamoon was seen there in the last couple of weeks, after the date of the letter regarding the dead drop location. Although it is a small chance, investigating the Manehattan Opera House, where she was last seen, could yield some fruit."
  SOL_raid_dodge_city_post_office:0 "Raid Dodge City Post Office"
  SOL_raid_dodge_city_post_office_desc:0 "The paper scraps in the New Horseleans camp have not yielded much, but on multiple there was a stamp of Dodge City on them. Dodge City is not large, and there are only a hoofful of post offices, especially those that are near the partial address on three of the scraps. If the offices are used a gateway for communication, it should not be hard to sniff it out."
  SOL_hunt_for_mareway_informant:0 "Hunt for Mareway Resistance Contact"
  SOL_hunt_for_mareway_informant_desc:0 "Among the half-burnt paper that we have reclaimed, a common name and location springs up in many of them. Sunrise Showers, a resident of Mareway, appears to be working with the Resistance, perhaps as a fence, perhaps as a proper member. A marehunt across all of Mareway will take some time, but capturing her alive will ideally give us a name or locations of recent Resistance meetings."
  SOL_raid_friendship_school:0 "Raid Ponyville Friendship School"
  SOL_raid_friendship_school_desc:0 "When the Empress's rule began, the School of Friendship in Ponyville was one of the first things to be shut down. Starlight and Trixie were both employees of the school, and it seems that they have used it as a meeting place in the past. There could be valuable information left behind there to bring us closer to stamping out this Resistance for good."
  SOL_investigate_raritys_manehattan_boutique:0 "Investigate Rarity's Manehattan Boutique"
  SOL_investigate_raritys_manehattan_boutique_desc:0 "Continuing to follow Trixie's scraps of information, we have been led to "Rarity for You," as there were receipts for a new cape and hat which were being custom-made by one of the tailors there. The owner, Coco Pommel, has been a loyal assistant to the Empire. Questioning her should be most frutiful."
  SOL_search_castle_for_clues:0 "Search for Clues in Everfree Castle"
  SOL_search_castle_for_clues_desc:0 "Evidence from the search of the School of Friendship point to the Everfree Forest, specifically, the Castle of the Two Sisters. A hidden, remote, and dangerous location such as it would pose a perfect staging ground for meetings and clandestine agreements. Since it is a desolate place, it should not take long to surface anything."
  SOL_find_information_in_canterlot_library:0 "Search [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Library for Information"
  SOL_find_information_in_canterlot_library_desc:0 "A piece of paper from our search of the old castle point to the head library of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as a safehouse and communications dispatch for the central region of the Empire. If we are able to apprehend a live Resistance member there, we should stand a strong chance of finding one of the heads of the Resistance."
  SOL_investigate_raritys_canterlot_boutique:0 "Investigate Rarity's [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Boutique"
  SOL_investigate_raritys_canterlot_boutique_desc:0 "It appears that [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Carousel is a hive of activity, and that multiple suspects have been seen going there in the last few months. With the latest clues, it's clear that its proprieter, Sassy Saddles, is involved. It is time that she is paid a visit."
  SOL_capture_sassy:0 "Capture Sassy Saddles"
  SOL_capture_sassy_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, Sassy Saddles was "away" on a business trip, which her underlinsg were reluctant to divulge originally. However, we now know that she is in Las Pegasus, ostensibly to broker business deals in the absence of Rarity, but more than likely an attempt to drum up more funding for the Harmonic Resistance. If we strike fast, we can still capture her, and finally learn all we need about the Resistance."
  SOL_destroy_resistance:0 "Crush the Resistance"
  SOL_destroy_resistance_desc:0 "With Sassy finally broken, we have learned the location of the next planned meeting of the different rebel cell heads. Prominent members include herself, Starlight Glimmer, Trixie Lulamoon, Limestone Pie, and others. We shall alert the Empress to this information, and we can expect the full weight of military to come down upon them and finally rid us of rebellion forever!"
  SOL_mop_up_stragglers:0 "Mop Up the Stragglers"
  SOL_mop_up_stragglers_desc:0 "The Harmonic Resistance's leadership has been crushed. There is no chance that another organized insurgency of their influence and strength will rise again. However, they were still able to thwart our stability and order, and there are still some who need to be shown the path of enlightenment. With their leaders imprisoned or killed, it will not be difficult to wipe out what's left of the rabble, and return our lands to peace once more."
  SOL_choose_flagship:0 "Designing the Empress's Flagship"
  SOL_choose_flagship_desc:0 "As our naval doctrines have improved and the underlying technology of warfare has advanced, it's become clear that the old ships that were built before the Empress ascended are no longer adequate for somepony of her stature. It is time that we decide upon what shall bear her name to all the world and stand as a symbol of the Imperial Navy's unmatched might!"

  EQS_project_nightvale:0 "§BProject Nightvale§!"
  EQS_project_astartes:0 "§YProject Astartes§!"
  EQS_project_astartes_desc:0 "Threats to our ponies exist around every corner. Whether it is from their brethren who wish to see the Order of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s Harmony shattered or it is from those who are jealous of our prosperity and security, every day it is a struggle for our survival. While the Empress protects us, she cannot be everywhere at once. Therefore, we must expand who is able to do so. She is the ultimate pony, and nopony else can hope to achieve her levels of perfection. However, that does not mean we cannot try, especially with a few merciful donations."

They do not require sustenance like the faithful does, nor do they need sleep, as they are creatures of darkness and sin. When they perish, their debts will be paid, but until then, they shall labor for us, and provide from the wealth of the earth."

  EQS_repair_temple_of_sun:0 "Repair the Pyramid of the Sun"
  EQS_repair_temple_of_sun_desc:0 "In ancient times, the Neighua ponies worshiped the sun and constructed expansive complexes with towering pyramids, aligned to the solstices and equinoxes. Historical evidence and oral history indicate that sacrifices were performed at these sites, but when contact was made with Equestrian explorers, it eventually fell out of favor when they learned of Celestia's benevolance. Daybreaker is not Celestia, and it is time that they return to their worship of her, for it is only the appropriate response to being ruled by a god."
  SOL_further_flurrys_war_training:0 "Further Firestorm's Training in War"
  SOL_further_flurrys_war_training_desc:0 "As she is still far too young to lead soldiers, Firestorm will be given extensive lessons outside of her normal curriculum, so that she may be one of the chosen leaders of the God-Empress. As an alicorn, she should take to it quite quickly."

  SOL_finalize_with_personal_instruction:0 "Finalize Firestorm's Training Personally"
  SOL_finalize_with_personal_instruction_desc:0 "Since Firestorm began her intensive studies and exercises in all aspects of war, she has become a formidable foe on the battlefield, but there are still many things that can be taught to her, for the God-Empress has not deigned Firestorm worthy of learning many of her own secrets. That shall change, with her last instructions being personal contests between herself and the God-Empress."
  SOL_remove_temporary_laws:0 "Rescind Wartime Measures"
  SOL_remove_temporary_laws_desc:0 "Although they were necessary to ensure smooth transitions to a more orderly society, many of the militarized aspects of some of our wartime laws are beginning to show their inflexibility. Military matters cannot properly deal with civilian problems, and the cudgels used for our defense are now beginning to harm us. We should reimplement some of the old laws until we can move to a fully-realized §Oempire§!."
  SOL_take_flurry:0 "Retrieve Flurry Heart"
  SOL_take_flurry_desc:0 "The Empress's young niece has lived under the influence of weak and impotent tutors from her birth, and Princess Cadance and Shining Armor have done little to further her understanding of the blessing with which she has been bestowed as a natural-birth alicorn. As Daybreaker is concerned for Flurry Heart's education, a visit to inform Cadance of her new home is in order."

  SOL_construct_cathedral_of_sun_desc:0 "[3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] is the center of [ROOT.GetNameDef] and the heart of all ponykind, and as the seat of the Empress's throne, loyal ponies from across the land frequently travel to pay their respects to their guardian. Although there have been attempts in the past to build something to honor Princess Celestia, it was always shut down. But now that the Empress has ascended, she is not averse to being given proper acknowledgement.

While it would need renovating and repairs, it is an excellent building for housing a new branch of the Empress's School for Blessed Unicorns, as numbers in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] are continuing to burgeon, and will soon overfill the school itself if we do not act."

  ###Leader Descriptions###
  fancy_albino_sunhorse_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 16th of March, 986 ALB in Vanhoover\n\nBorn to a simple working class family in one of the boroughs of Vanhoover, Arcane Nova was always aware from an early age of the dangers that were present not a couple hundred miles north of the metropolis. From her parents and teachers, the radio and newspapers, the changeling menace was always something that was in the back of her, and many of her generation's minds. Although there never was a changeling infiltration like some ponies in Vanhoover feared, the backdrop of the threat shaped many of her early interests in military strategy. When Queen Chrysalis almost toppled the Equestrian government in 1002, it only further pushed the teen Arcane Nova to apply for every military academy that would potentially take her.\n\nAn appreciation for war in pre-dawn Equestria was looked upon as strange or frightening, but after acceptance into the class of 1005 to Fillydelphia Military Academy, her talent for analyzing combat situations and adapting to unexpected developments became apparent. When she set a new record for holding out in a scenario designed to be an impossible defense, she was transferred to Canterlot's academy to further refine her aptitude to war and war-related magic.\n\nIn the ensuing restructuring of the military after Daybreaker's ascension, her unwavering dedication to guarding Equestria and her astute observations earned her a position within the military science wing of the Solar Empire. When she was summoned by Daybreaker to personally oversee and ensure the loyalty of New Mareland, she was more than eager to prove her abilities to her Empress.\n\nIn New Mareland, she has guaranteed that there is nothing that can be used to question the Empress's decrees. Unrest has been met with disproportionate punishment, and any and all mention to Luna, thestrals, or other creatures of the night have been suppressed. In time, the troublesome colony will become a model subject of the Empress, where the Dawn Star is revered at all times, and all dissidence is eliminated with cauterizing efficiency.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

Although her abilities are unquestioned, her past has been shrouded in more mystery than her superiors would prefer.\n\nAccording to her recruitment file, she grew up in one of the prosperous families of Manehattan, although the only ponies who match her parents' names barely have earned their cutie marks. From her wealthy upbringing, she has had the opportunity to travel abroad, through the lands of Equus, Griffonia, and Zebrica, where she traveled off the beaten path, and practiced remaining unseen to experience the greatest sights. In her interview, she failed to elaborate on specifics of these trips.\n\nHowever, her enigmatic past is overshadowed by her ability to earn results. As an adept at remaining unseen, she has uncovered countless backroom deals in both the political and corporate sphere. On a couple of her reports, she pointed to information in places she never visited and were verified by other agents. How she obtains the details remains another mystery to the rest of her peers. When asked, she merely winks or informs them that it would be spoilers.\n\nShe has lived up to her promises in her initial recruitment. Competent and mysterious, she has yet to fail a mission, no matter where she is sent. Although her flirtatious, and sometimes psychotic behavior has led to fellow agents requesting transfers from operations conducted together, she does, in the end, exemplify the spirit of the Empire's intelligence community.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

Whether it is to hinder nations surrounding the Empire or keeping tabs on the citizens within it, he has either done it before or something close like it.\n\nGrowing up in Vanhoover, Absconditus utilized his wits to his advantage on the streets, when his family at times could barely afford the rent of even the cheapest subsidized housing. Through either subterfuge or guile, he frequently brought home enough food to survive when he wasn't in school, which turned into more elaborate heists as he grew older, leaving him an expert in winding the streets and avoiding undue attention. To him, harmony meant little when his family was destitute.\n\nIt was only when a S.M.I.L.E. agent stationed in Vanhoover as changeling activity became more worrying noticed him that his luck turned. Instead of arrest, as he had almost succeeded in stealing from the agent, he instead was given an offer to assist S.M.I.L.E., which he took, if grudgingly, however, his training was far from finished when the Solar Empire was declared. Within the Empire, his chances of advancement were far greater, as agents defected or were arrested for not bowing the knee to Daybreaker.\n\nAlthough still fresh, he has completely embraced the power and opportunity that the Solar Empire presents. Its idea of retooling harmony into something that works for everypony, instead of only those that are already advantaged, speaks to the wounds still smarting from his life in Vanhoover. Above all else, the order of Daybreaker must be preserved, and he will help guard against it, whenever the chance is given.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§!"
  POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_SOLAR_AGE_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography:§! Since the dawn of pony nations, there have been tales of two sisters, bearing the hallmarks of the three tribes. The magic of unicorns, the strength of earth ponies, and flight of pegasi. From the onset, the eldest took upon herself the greater task of raising the sun to warm and bless all, while the younger raised the moon as a guiding light. These myths morphed and changed each generation, but all pointed to the two sisters, Princesses Celestia and Luna.\n\nLittle is known about their origin, as in the time of the three tribes, they appeared to lead the fledgling nation of Equestria, taking the mantle of the heavenly bodies, and guided all their new subjects into harmony. Through their example, they encouraged everypony to tolerate, love, and care for each other.\n\nTime can sour the strongest relationships, however, and eventually Luna's soul was burdened with jealousy for her sister's recognition. By striking out as Nightmare Moon, she showed the first crack in the otherwise serene and loving diarchs. With Nightmare Moon's banishment, Celestia assumed sole leadership of a broken Equestria, which she healed in time through sweat and tears. For a thousand years, her ponies were protected from all that threatened them by their Princess. No compensation was requested nor expected, as she loved her ponies like a mother does their children.\n\nIn the modern era, countries deride the idea of compassion, and war's onslaught, with the blood, death, and ruin that it brings unveils that the beliefs and ideals of a millennia-old mindset have run their course. Although Celestia tried, Harmony could not be preserved. A mother's love was tested by every lost battle that transpired.\n\nUltimately that love pushed her to new heights. As her ponies suffered, Celestia's purpose changed. Protection came not from the pen, but the sword. Embracing the fires of her wrath, Celestia, now ascended as Daybreaker Sun, reformed the impotent Equestria into an efficient and orderly Empire. While her ponies may protest at the radical and sudden alterations, it is irrelevant. All she needs is a nation ready to lay down its life to guard Harmony from all threats, within and without.\n\n§YPortraits By:§! RyanBoi, Avrameow, and December Breeze"

Although part of a minor family of the Canterlot elite, he rarely speaks of his background as a point of pride. According to him, his parents were rather uninspired and were completely content to remain in their position of wealth and obscurity, but he was not.\n\nAfter studying in Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns with a degree in advanced abdjuration and conjuration magic, he penned a number of papers that ultimately earned the attention of the EEA, where he was made a board member to oversee the quality of magical education within Equestria. Once he was appointed as the new chancellor, various reforms and revisions passed through his office, all of which were instantly approved. While none of his changes were against the ideals of Harmony as advocated by Celestia per se, new red tape for "grade standards" prevented many non-ponies, and event thestrals, from attending any EEA-accredited institution.\n\nWhen Twilight Sparkle opened her School of Friendship, he was quick to vocalize his and the EEA's distrust of the non-ponies allowed to attend, although ultimately he was forced to allow it to operate outside of the EEA when Cozy Glow's plans to siphon all magic from the land was exposed. However, he remains a staunch advocate of the "quality" education that the EEA provides and remains a voice for stricter interaction with outside nations that don't "understand ponykind's needs."§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §Lphp97§!"

As the first of their kind, the subjects that survived the ordeal have been hardened and show little sign of ever faltering in protecting the Empire from internal and external threats. The pedigree does make them somewhat arrogant toward the other legions, but as they were all hoof-trained by the Empress, this confidence is warranted, and leads to them being a cut above many of the other legions that will follow.§!"
  EQS_SOL_history_legio_II:0 "§LThe Dawn Angels are an almost exclusively unicorn legion, both from willing and unwilling subjects. Like Legio I Primaris, Legio II has a number of original test subjects from Project Astartes, although not to the same number. While clothed in the same armor as Primaris and every other legion, they rely less on their magical weapons and more on their innate magic, and can be identified by their pure white plating with orange flares. Blueblood has been offered by Bunsen Beaker and Pinpoint to undergo the process of becoming a Praetorian in order to lead the Dawn Angels, but he has so far steadfastly refused, citing the danger and the potential loss of identity in the creation process.§!"
  EQS_SOL_history_legio_III:0 "§LLegio III is comprised of many pegasi who willingly underwent the process of becoming Praetorian Guards during Project Astartes' final days, with the promise that they could forever serve as guardians of the sky and the Empire. A number of guards within the legion are also former aces or other war heroes, which has made it one of the flashier and more popular legions after the Praetorian Guard was revealed to the populace. Part of the process of becoming Praetorians affects pegasi somewhat differently, which causes many subjects to lose what inhibitions they may have had in battle. Due to this, they frequently fly into the heat of battle, and become drenched in the blood of the Empire's enemies. These feats have earned them the name Blood Ravens, and they have since adopted that color to be their color standard, leading to a terrifying sight on the battlefield.§!"
  EQS_SOL_history_legio_IV:0 "§LLegio IV Sun Sworn is the last of the "pure" legions, as they have a plurality of guards who were earth pony subjects during Project Astartes' development. While they do not have the magic of Legio II or the flight of Legio III, what the Sun Sworn lack in terms of unique features they make up for in bravery and grit. Primaris is frequently tasked with protecting the Empress herself, and the Dawn Angels and Blood Ravens have their tactical advantages. The Sun Sworn are the blunt hammer on the battlefield, and will risk life and limb charging into heavy fire, so that the normal ponies of the Empire may be protected. Ponies that they once were, and wish to see have a life of Order and Harmony.§!"

In exchange for their lives, they have been created as the ultimate troops to defend in the frightening darkness, and have received their own unique, magical enhancements to further improve their night vision and reactions. These additional enchantments require them to be helmeted at all times, as their vision is too sensitive for the day, and their increased agility makes them twitchy, even for the ever-alert Praetorian. Although they are smaller in number compared to other legions, they are just as dedicated to ensuring the Empire stands, and Order and Harmony prevail. They are the unseen saviors, protecting the citizens of the Empire while they sleep, and eliminating any dangers that lurk in the dark.§!"

Everypony who obeys the Empress must be made aware of this. Sympathy is a weakness. Order demands that unity be paramount, and those who do not unite will be destroyed!"
  SOL_take_everypony:0 "Press Any Into Service"
  SOL_take_everypony_desc:0 "We cannot afford to be picky when it comes to conscription. The very fate of Harmony itself is in the balance. No matter the pony - young, old, mare, stallion - they must be brought in to fight against our enemies. Some may falter. Some may struggle. All will fight on the field, so that we may bury our enemies in bodies!"
  SOL_reconquer_equestria:0 "Bring Back the Foalish"
  SOL_reconquer_equestria_desc:0 "In the civil war, many "nations" believed that they could claim their "right" to independence. In their delusion, they think they can survive this world without the light and protection of the Sun. They are wrong. The Empress will bring them back into [ROOT.GetNameDef], for there can be only one. Unity is the natural state of ponies, and she will deliver it."

  SOL_waking_dawn_star_desc:0 "Equestria burns all around us, but in our darkest hour, the first sign of hope has sprung forth. Celestia is no longer, for she has been reborn. The bright light of the Sun shall guide us, and in its warmth we shall crush all those that threaten us!"
  SOL_fire_ministers:0 "Retire the Old Ministers"
  SOL_fire_ministers_desc:0 "The old privy council of Princess Celestia has yet to meet their new Empress and they are still under the belief that blind faith to the old understanding of Harmony is what guides [ROOT.GetNameDef]. They will not take kindly to what our Empress wishes for us, but that is acceptable. They weren't needed, anyway."
  SOL_bluebloods_fealty:0 "Require Blueblood's Fealty"
  SOL_bluebloods_fealty_desc:0 "Prince Blueblood has proven to be both efficient and ruthless on the battlefield, but has thus far ignored any communications from the Empress to confirm his loyalty. This will not do, as a military needs a field marshal, and he shall serve perfectly. It's time for a little family visit."
  SOL_appoint_committee:0 "Appoint a Committee of War"
  SOL_appoint_committee_desc:0 "Although many of the wartime measures that have been implemented through the Empress have had an effect, there has not been a body designated to coordinate the economy and ensure that it can be fully tooled and efficiently provide for our soldiers. We must rectify this, so that we can outproduce our foes and survive this war."
  SOL_answer_crimes:0 "Answer Crimes with Crimes"
  SOL_answer_crimes_desc:0 "Ponies within our nation seem to believe that they have the ability to protest and affect this new change in the Empress. They are nothing but misguided foals, raising their voices against the wind, hoping that they can drown it out when they should rather embrace the direction it takes them. Like foals, they must, and will be, corrected."
  SOL_sweeping_chaff:0 "Sweeping out the Chaff"
  SOL_sweeping_chaff_desc:0 "Dissention within the military has reached an all-time high, as companies and armies have been split in their support of the Empress or their incorrect understanding of what true Harmony is. Many are impossible to convince that the Empress is the only way forward, and they will have to be dealt with. Permanently."
  SOL_first_feelers:0 "The First Feelers"
  SOL_first_feelers_desc:0 "Although cleansing of the government is still underway, that does not preclude use from searching for replacements for those who once comprised the privy council of the Empress. Many younger ponies, especially, are on board with the changes that the Empress has brought on, and it should not be hard to find those with talent to serve."
  SOL_break_dissent:0 "Crack Down on Open Dissent"
  SOL_break_dissent_desc:0 "Despsite efforts to contain official news media, that has not prevented grass-roots organizations from utilizing the airwaves to broadcast news from the front or organize local protests. These stations are a danger to us all, and additionally, spread harmful misinformation about the Empress. It is time that the glove be removed from her iron hoof."
  SOL_plants_in_chaos:0 "Plants in Chaos"
  SOL_plants_in_chaos_desc:0 "Some soldiers and officers have hid their doubts better than others, but they still leave evidence that they are working against the Empress. Although they are not public, like those who have been dealt with, they can still cause damage. Planting a few loyal soldiers in all companies will ensure that the truth is exposed and the guilty judged."
  SOL_personal_training:0 "Personal Training"
  SOL_personal_training_desc:0 "While Prince Blueblood was instructed well during his time in military college, he has become rather arrogant in his abilities. Arrogance can kill.\n\nAs he is her only kin, the Empress has taken a renewed interest in his knowledge of war. He will learn from her, whether he wants to or not."
  SOL_reward_loyal:0 "Reward the Loyal"
  SOL_reward_loyal_desc:0 "Raven Inkwell has been the faihtful servant of the Empress for almost a decade, silently and diligently going about her work and keeping the government running smoothly. As she has remained a background pony for so long, it is only time that her steadfastness be rewarded, with a position more deserving a pony like her."
  SOL_arbitrary_judgement:0 "Arbitrary Judgements"
  SOL_arbitrary_judgement_desc:0 "There is only way to deal with the chaos that has been wrought upon us internally. While we still struggle with outsiders, our own have betrayed us and seek to topple their only chance at safety and security. There is only one fate for any who are accused of such a crime. Trial not requried."
  SOL_solidify_merger:0 "Solidify Merger"
  SOL_solidify_merger_desc:0 "With the onset of the war, the Empress, at the time, temporarily merged many of the civilian and military offices together to establish a smooth and straightforward chain of command within [ROOT.GetNameDef]. However, it is not a permanent solution, and something that codifies what magister deals with what must be created, lest everything wrought in a time of crisis fail during peace."
  SOL_suns_son:0 "The Sun's Son"
  SOL_suns_son_desc:0 "Despite his initial protests regarding his training, Blueblood has taken well to the lessons given to him. Much of the Empress's mindset has rubbed off on him, and he has taken to more closely analyzing situations, and doling out appropriate punishment for those who commit crimes against her. With him by the Empress's side, nopony will dare to raise disagreement in her presence."
  SOL_judge_jury_executioner:0 "Judge, Jury, Executioner"
  SOL_judge_jury_executioner_desc:0 "With the very existence of [ROOT.GetNameDef] in peril from within and without, the niceties of "representation" and a "fair trial" are simply things that cannot be afforded. While we are in crisis, there is only one arbiter of truth and law that we can trust. That pony is our Empress."
  SOL_take_charge:0 "Take Personal Charge"
  SOL_take_charge_desc:0 "Foals and traitors abound within the lands of [ROOT.GetNameDef], leading us to Tartarus rather than safety. However, there is still a beacon of light within these dark hours. While our armies falter and our nation cries out in fear, she will answer us. The Empress shall guide us. The Sun itself will be our lamp and light. All shall taste its flame and perish!"
  SOL_successor_question:0 "The Question of a Successor"
  SOL_successor_question_desc:0 "The Empress is one mare, and she is without child. If the worst would happen, somepony would need to take up the reins of [ROOT.GetNameDef] in her place. It is incomprehensible, but every battle brings her into slight risk of grievous injury or death. There must be stability. There must be an annointed one to take her place."
  SOL_Imperium_Solis:0 "Imperium Solaris"
  #SOL_Imperium_Solis_desc:0 "It is time for a new dawn for Equestria - the Solar Empire shall rise, and all will bask in the light and glory of our Empress!"
  SOL_Imperium_Solis_desc:0 "Dissent has been quelled. Open rebellion is no longer an option. As the sun has set on the old Equestria, it is time for a new, greater nation to take its place. From its ashes, the Solar Empire shall rise like a phoenix! The Empress's light and majesty will shine before all, and those that resist will be incinerated in her justice!"

  #SOL_god_empress_desc:0 "How can a being that raises the Sun not be a god? Princess Celestia might have rejected worship, but it is only fit for the Empress to be revered. May our Sun shine eternally! Forever will She be praised!"
  SOL_god_empress_desc:0 "The idea of worship was maligned and dissuaded by Princess Celestia, but that does not mean she was not a deity. After all, what mortal is able to raise the Sun itself? While many disagree, there is only one action that is fit for our Empress, nay, our GOD-EMPRESS. Our unending adoration is the only thing worthy of her. May the Sun shine forever! May the God-Empress be praised! SOL INVICTUS!"
  SOL_unveil_cultus:0 "Unveil the Solaris Cultus"
  SOL_unveil_cultus_desc:0 "Since the God-Empress defated the Nightmare, there has always been a fringe movement who desired to see everypony worship her and see her as the deity that she is. While it was marginalized in the Equestria of old, it is time that these faithful ponies, who endured much, to be brought to light. The Solaris Cultus shall baptize all in Her light, and bring fire to those that resist!"
  SOL_solaris_adoratio:0 "Solaris Adoratio"
  SOL_solaris_adoratio_desc:0 "With the Cultus ingraining itself within society, its arm dedicated solely to the veneration of the God-Empress, the Solaris Adoratio, shall be given any and all resources it requires to see that She is worshiped from coast to coast. Everypony will be steeped in Her theology and learn to love the God-Empress as the Cultus does, lest they perish in the Holy Flame."
  SOL_solaris_inquisitionis:0 "Solaris Inquisitionis"
  SOL_solaris_inquisitionis_desc:0 "There are a number of ponies within [ROOT.GetNameDef] who are zealous for ensuring the that the God-Empress is worshiped, far beyond typical evangelism. Likewise, there are ponies who will never see the wisdom of the Empress, and oppose her until death. The Holy Solaris Inquisitionis shall be created, that it may cleanse the rot and disbelief and thereby secure Harmony."
  SOL_suffer_not_heresy:0 "Suffer Not the Heretic"
  SOL_suffer_not_heresy_desc:0 "As the Adoratio continues to instruct more ponies in the sanity of the Empress's message, there are some who will clearly never acknowledge her as their rightful goddess. There is no reasoning with these ponies. If they are given opportunity, they will only corrupt others around them, and spread like a cancer across [ROOT.GetNameDef]. There is only one cure for cancer: §Ofire§!."
  SOL_Mandatory_Temple_Attendance:0 "Mandatory Temple Attendance"
  #SOL_Mandatory_Temple_Attendance_desc:0 "The Sun-Goddess rightfully demands worship - and her subjects shall provide. While some may need to be shown the light first, the Temples of the Sun will be full - and all shall hear the message."
  SOL_Mandatory_Temple_Attendance_desc:0 "All ponies were created for the veneration of the God-Empress - it is not optional. As a thousand years or more of secularism has held onto society, there is much inertia that must be overcome, but Her subjects will provide, whether they wish to or not. Those that resist will be shown the light of Her Holy Flame, and before long the churches of the Cultus will be brimming with itching ears for salvation."
  SOL_inquisitionis_secondary_role:0 "Inquisitionis Secondary Role"
  SOL_inquisitionis_secondary_role_desc:0 "With most of the attention of the citizens upon the Cultus and the Adoratio, the Inquisitionis can perform its work of protecting the Empress and Harmony without the prying eyes of the average pony. Although their work is more important than anypony else, they shall keep their flame hidden. Their only presence will be the empty spaces they leave behind."
  SOL_inquisitionis_primary_role:0 "Inquisitionis Primary Role"
  SOL_inquisitionis_primary_role_desc:0 "As their own place outside of the Solaris Cultus, even if tied to it and answerable to Padlock and the Empress, the Inquisitionis is its own entity. They work best when they are given whatever resources they require, and from whomever they request it. With their prominence, they shall eradicate all heresy from within, and all threat of unbelief from without!"
  SOL_solaris_speculatores:0 "Solaris Speculatores"
  SOL_solaris_speculatores_desc:0 "It is undeniable that there are threats around every corner to Harmony, and many are unseen from the eyes of the average pony. As more nations take notice of our Empress's goals, they will only try to subvert the stability of [ROOT.GetNameDef] further. We must nip this in the bud by rebuilding S.M.I.L.E. into something that is worthy of her glory, dedicated to preserving Order and Harmony."
  SOL_Lux_et_Tenebris:0 "Lux in Tenebris"
  #SOL_Lux_et_Tenebris_desc:0 "The young shall be enlightened by the Sun, lighting the torch of education. Proper, patriotic schooling will guarantee the prosperity of the Empire."
  SOL_Lux_et_Tenebris_desc:0 "It is a fact that how a pony is educated while they are young will dictate their beliefs as they grow older. At this time, the curriculum of the young has yet to be rewritten to provide proper, patriotic, religious schooling. Further efforts will be intensified, so that we may educate a generation of new worshipers that will guarantee the security of Harmony and the Empire itself."
  SOL_faith_honor_family:0 "Faith, Honor, Family"
  SOL_faith_honor_family_desc:0 "The God-Empress is not a tyrant. She is a loving mother, who merely wishes to see Her foals grow into a proper understanding of their place in Her world. It is every pony's duty to mirror this duty to their families. If they are not ready to sacrifice their all for those they love, how can they understand Her demands for their own lives? All shall better [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] society, one foal at a time."
  SOL_Faith_Sacrifice_Worship:0 "Faith, Sacrifice, Worship"
  #SOL_Faith_Sacrifice_Worship_desc:0 "The warm light of the Sun, so graciously provided by the God-Empress, is not without its price. The faithful must be prepared and willing to do everything to serve the Sun - even if it means their death."
  SOL_Faith_Sacrifice_Worship_desc:0 "The God-Empress is not an unreasonable mistress. For Her provision to Her ponies, she asks very little. As She gives graciously the warmth, protection, and light of the Sun, She requires that the faithful must be ready to sacrifice everything in Her goals, which are far above the thoughts of those below Her. Whether young, old, mare, or stallion, everything will be asked to be given, even if it's their very lives."
  SOL_field_executions:0 "Field Executions"
  SOL_field_executions_desc:0 "As our territory expands to bring the light of the God-Empress to all, there will be untold amount of insurrection, sin, and heresy. Not all of it can be tried in a court of law, for it would bog down the system to no end. Inquisitors in their roles of enforcing Her will upon the masses shall have a new liberty: anypony deemed guilty on inspection of heresy has forfeit their right to trial. They shall be cleansed immediately."
  SOL_State_Personified:0 "State Personified"
  #SOL_State_Personified_desc:0 "Her word is law, her thought is policy, her gesture is the direction to take. As the Sun moves across the sky, so does Equestria move with it. The Sun-Empress is truly the state itself."
  SOL_State_Personified_desc:0 "Princess Celestia may have surrounded herself with advisors, but they only weakened her will and corrupted the pure intentions of her heart. The God-Empress is not impotent like she, for She is the very Heart of the Empire itself. Every word that She speaks shall be law, and every direction She gives shall guide the whole nation. As our infallible Goddess, She is the only one who knows the true way forward."
  SOL_solar_games:0 "The Solar Games"
  SOL_solar_games_desc:0 "For generations, the Friendship Games were held across the lands of Equestria as a way to unify the nation and provide an outlet for the competitive nature that many ponies had within themselves. However, these outdated ideals that the games held to will only weaken society. They must be reworked. Reborn. The Solar Games will provide an avenue for ponies to prove their worth to the Empress and weed the weak from the strong."
  SOL_raising_generations:0 "Raising Generations"
  SOL_raising_generations_desc:0 "It is not the task of just one family to raise a foal, for it is the duty of everypony in their community to ensure that they are being reared to rightfully fear the awesome might of the God-Empress. The nation is dependent on the next generation to udnerstand their duty to Her. If they do not stop heresy when they see it, then it shall forever be a stain upon the entire community, and a mark of sin upon them all."
  SOL_better_than_best:0 "Better than Best"
  SOL_better_than_best_desc:0 "Who can compare themselves to the God-Empress? She is perfection. She is power incarnate. As the Sun scorches all that remain in it too long, She likewise is unstoppable. Upon the battlefield, She is unmatched. We can only hope to follow her into Tartarus and survive."
  SOL_sacrifices_from_birth:0 "Sacrifices from Birth"
  SOL_sacrifices_from_birth_desc:0 "Although the Cultus has grown since it was made the official state religion, it is still small compared to the general population. If we are to continue to expand and keep the God-Empress safe, it must grow with the populace. To that end, it is best to train the young of the nation within it from infancy. Whether their parents will agree with this is inconsequential."
  SOL_annual_purges:0 "Annual Purges"
  SOL_annual_purges_desc:0 "Complacency is something that can easily set in, and there is no better example of this than in government. While the God-Empress leads, there are hundreds of support staff for Her so that She need not concern Herself with trivial affairs. Lest they be allowed to grow fat and lazy, they shall constantly be evaluated. If they do not measure up, they will feel her wrath."
  SOL_enlightened_education:0 "Enlightened Education"
  SOL_enlightened_education_desc:0 "In the halls of universities across the Empire, students are taught to think critically, but they are not instructed on what they must ponder. If left undirected, they could come to incorrect conclusions regarding the Empire, Order, and Harmony. If we are to secure our nation as it matures, they must be pointed back to the correct conclusions, or face the consequences of their rebellion."
  SOL_tradition_of_worship:0 "Tradition of Worship"
  SOL_tradition_of_worship_desc:0 "Ponies across the Empire have held to various cultural traditions for centuries. It is in the mortal mass's nature to find ways to add to their life rituals and routines. While secularism has been a mainstay since Nightmare Moon's defeat, it cannot be undone. Finding ways to creep worship into life outside of the local church will further strengthen our social unity, and ensure the populace will obey the God-Empress."
  SOL_sacrifices_on_assembly_line:0 "Sacrifices on the Assembly Line"
  SOL_sacrifices_on_assembly_line_desc:0 "While the Empire has a strong industrial base, we must always be ready for the next threat that may arise to Harmony and Order. Every chance that a pony has must be put into their work, as a form of worship to the God-Empress. As their bones break, their bodies wear out, and their minds tire, they will give their all to Her, so that She may guard the light of Harmony forever!"
  SOL_generals_above_rest:0 "Generals Above the Rest"
  SOL_generals_above_rest_desc:0 "It is not only the Militarium that has bright minds for leading everypony in the defense of the Empire. Within the Solaris Cultus and Inquisitionis, there are many ponies who are gifted in leadership. Who says that they cannot lead the troops, even if they do not answer to the Imperial High Command? They answer only to the God-Empress, and their instructions will be clearer and purer than any general."
  SOL_fodder_troops:0 "Fodder Troops"
  SOL_fodder_troops_desc:0 "There are no shortage of ponies who have been convicted of heresy, rebellion, and unbelief within our jails. Although they can be examples when they are cleansed by flame, they can only be so once. If we use them as forward squads, they can be useful AND be purified in a different kind of fire, while saving the Inquisitionis valuable time for more heresy hunting."
  SOL_combine_church_and_state:0 "Combine Church and State"
  SOL_combine_church_and_state_desc:0 "The root of the issue with the old government was that there was moral framework to which they could properly align themselves. Therefore, they grew corrupt, greedy, complacent, and stupid. Keeping the Cultus and the government rungs beneath the God-Empress separate is a mistake. A mistake that shall be rectified immediately."
  SOL_honorable_guards:0 "Honorable Guards"
  SOL_honorable_guards_desc:0 "The Royal Guard of old was little more than a showpiece. Where were they when Chrysalis invaded in 1002? What good were they when Tirek nearly destroyed the nation in 1004? In light of their incompetence, the call shall go out. The most gifted shall become the honor guard of the God-Empress, and they shall lay down their lives at the slightest hint of danger to Her."
  SOL_monsters_of_earth:0 "Monsters of the Earth"
  SOL_monsters_of_earth_desc:0 "There are few weapons that can inspire fear and awe like the heavy tanks that comprise a small portion of the Militarium. Although a pale facsimile of Her might and glory, they are the most punishing pieces of machinery on the battlefield. Furthering the grants to designers will only further the purest form of battle worship that the Empire can follow."
  SOL_She_Who_Raises_the_Sun:0 "She Who Raises the Sun"
  #SOL_She_Who_Raises_the_Sun_desc:0 "Without her Sun, the world would be shrouded in eternal darkness. Without her Sun, there would be no life. The God-Empress is the life-giver, the protector, the Empire itself - She Who Raises the Sun."
  SOL_She_Who_Raises_the_Sun_desc:0 "Like the Sun itself, the God-Empress provides life, protection, and healing to all of her faithful. Without Her, the world would be plunged into the eternal darkness of Chaos and Disharmony. Without Her, all that is good and perfect would shrivel away. She is the Day Star. She is Harmony. She is the Empire itself: She is She Who Raises the Sun!"

  ###Empress Mother###
  SOL_empress_mother:0 "Service of Self"
  #SOL_empress_mother_desc:0 "Ponies are like foals, in need of a wise, yet stern parent. It is the duty of the Empress to be a mother to all her subjects. May she watch over us."
  SOL_empress_mother_desc:0 "There is little that the a pony can do to come close to the wonder of the Empress. She is above us. Her needs are her own.

  ###Empress Protector###
  SOL_empress_protector:0 "Hero of the Ponies"
  #SOL_empress_protector_desc:0 "The ponies, and other beings, need protection from harm and disorder - only in this way we can uphold Harmony. The Sun is a loving, nurturing protector. She watches over us all."
  SOL_empress_protector_desc:0 "The ponies of Equestria are meant to be guarded and protected. Princess Celestia knew this well, and it slowly gnawed at her as she was too constrained by her cabinet and her morals to do everything necessary. The Empress has transcended these issues, and will protect us from all harm, whether we see it for our good or not."

  ###Conquests###
  SOL_pax_solaris:0 "§OPax Solaris§!"
  SOL_pax_solaris_desc:0 "The age of warfare has finally come to an end. Our Empress has carved a swath of land, the like of which the world has never seen.

  ###Military###
  SOL_modernize_relic:0 "Modernize the Relic"
  SOL_modernize_relic_desc:0 "The Imperial Military is still a holdover from the time before the Empress ascended. Although it has served us well, the cruft is obvious, and there are many within who still cling to the mistakes of the past. Like the rest of society, there must be a complete and utter reorganization for there to be an effective defense force for the Empire."

  ###Army###
  SOL_establish_solaris_militarium:0 "Establish the Solaris Militarium"
  SOL_establish_solaris_militarium_desc:0 "Despite the reforms and forced progress that the Equestrian Army went through, it was kicking and screaming the entire way. It has accomplished what it needed to be, but it must be taken to pasture and a new, streamlined entity must take its place. Likewise, it must reflect the strength and beauty of the Empress, and each soldier in it will embody her will until their last breath."
  SOL_inspect_officers:0 "Inspections of the Officers"
  SOL_inspect_officers_desc:0 "When the Equestrian Army finally broke out of its slow decay, there was a wide and indiscriminate recruitment and training program for many commissioned officers to fill obvious gaps. That led to the insubordination that plagued it when the Empress first ascended. Although that threat has been dealt with, there are still many who have rather unwise relationships. They shall be cut free. Permanently."
  SOL_encourage_troops:0 ""Encouragement" of the Troops"
  SOL_encourage_troops_desc:0 "When conscription was implemented within Equestria, there was no thought of loyalty beyond protecting the nation. There are many ponies who will happily die for whomever orders them to, but there are others who have become conscientious objectors while yet others remain on the fence. Cleansing the pacifists should be enough of a reminder to those who remain unconvinced of their loyalties."
  SOL_break_out_blueprints:0 "Break out Blueprints"
  SOL_break_out_blueprints_desc:0 "The Equestrian High Command dawdled on adopting an armored corps until it was too late. While there were attempts at modernization once war came upon the land, it was not enough. However, that did not mean that ponies did not wish to innovate and bring contemporary warfare to Equus. Many companies had working prototoypes, so now it's time that our engineers finally take them for our benefit."
  SOL_rearrange_command:0 "An Imperial High Command"
  SOL_rearrange_command_desc:0 "Although the Equestrian Army was thoroughly revitalized whe push came to shove, there are still redundancies or unneeded positions within the command structure which add additional paperwork, headaches, and costs that could be avoided with a bit of dross purging, whether their loyalty is suspect or not."
  SOL_imperial_factory_tour:0 "Imperial Factory Tours"
  SOL_imperial_factory_tour_desc:0 "Before the Empress ascended, she had not seen a gun since the first smoothbores were brought back from Griffonia. Primarily, she allowed the high command of Equus to decide upon policy, and kept only an academic understanding of the tools used of her troops. However, her interest has renewed. Factory tours will provide opportunity to showcase new weaponry, and, hopefully get approval from her."
  SOL_motivate_engineers:0 "Motivations to the Non-Combatants"
  SOL_motivate_engineers_desc:0 "Tens of thousands of ponies work in roles within the Militarium to support it and our troops. Although they may not have a direct impact on combat, if they were to lose their desire to serve the Empress, it would eventually lead to a collapse of the military in general. To finish her tour of the Militarium, the Empress shall meet with some influential civilian employees and guarantee their loyalty."
  SOL_prevent_embarrassments:0 "Prevent Further Embarrassments"
  SOL_prevent_embarrassments_desc:0 "Thus far, some of the most prominent generals that have openly supported the previous regime have upheld their oaths. However, they are too beloved and too vital to simply dispose of if they betray us, no matter the evidence against them; yet they are also too much of a risk to allow an active role. Reassignment to desk jobs should keep them easy to watch and useless in fomenting dissent against the Empress."
  SOL_traitors_reward:0 "The Traitors' Reward"
  SOL_traitors_reward_desc:0 "The prominent generals who have been foolish enough to openly vocalize their displeasure with the Empress, no matter how beloved, are an active threat to Order and Harmony. The Empress shall not allow this.\n\n§ROnly the flame can cleanse their taint from the Militarium.§!"
  SOL_sun_shines:0 "The Sun Shines upon All"
  SOL_sun_shines_desc:0 "Despite their past, the outspoken generals who have voiced their concerns about the Empress's new orders regarding the Militarium are ponies like any other. They can be corrected and guided, and their skills are invaluable, especially in this time of transition to a proper fighting force. Pardons will be issued to them, and they shall be given a chance like the rest of her subjects."
  SOL_new_officers:0 "New Blood"
  #SOL_new_officers_desc:0 "We have no shortage of ambitious, young or overlooked officers. While their potential might have been wasted under the old regime, the Empire will most certainly make good use of their skills."
  SOL_new_officers_desc:0 "With the necessary revisions complete, there is opportunity for many officers, recruits, or conscripts to earn higher positions within the Militarium. After all, we do not lack ponies with ambition or motivation, and while those considered ruthless may have been overlooked by the Equestrian Army, we do not hold to such antiquated beliefs."
  SOL_safest_methods:0 "The Safest Methods"
  SOL_safest_methods_desc:0 "Although much of the old regime's tactics are outdated, their heart of preserving the lives of ponies is something that we cannot discard. Extensive networks of trenches and efficient supply lines, along with superior planning, will ensure that the day is won with the fewest losses possible."
  SOL_byzantine_supply:0 "Optimizing Supply Lines"
  SOL_byzantine_supply_desc:0 "When ponies are at the ends of the Empire, protecting the Empress and others, the last thing on their mind is when they will run out of food or ammunition. Through a series of checks, counter-measures, and balances, as well as a liberal application of new form requests and tracking, there may be more work involved in quartermastering, but not a single soldier will go without once the reforms are in place."
  SOL_digging_earth:0 "Digging to the Earth"
  SOL_digging_earth_desc:0 "Static warfare has been a hallmark of previous generations, but modern times have required updated tactics. Trenches, while still indispensable, must be adapted, too. Newer technologies allow for more rapid creation of systems, and through a bit of liberal application of explosive magic, expanded with relative ease, no matter the pressure from the enemy."
  SOL_combined_defenses:0 "Combined Defenses"
  SOL_combined_defenses_desc:0 "With many nations leaning into mobile, tank warfare, the necessity to respond to emerging breaches in the front line requires a creation of various vanguards that can respond to enemy spearheads in short order and deal with them with extreme prejudice."
  SOL_efficient_clearing:0 "Efficient Trench Clearing"
  SOL_efficient_clearing_desc:0 "When infantry manages to assault and invade the trenches of opposing forces, it can still be a suicidal effort, as the enemy is both prepared and desperate to fend off an attack. Statistics indicate that after crossing "No Mare's Land" a soldier is most likely to perish in the clearing of enemy trenches. Recent advances in infernal warfare, though, promises to cauterize the enemy before they can even resist."
  SOL_generational_leaps:0 "Generational Leaps"
  SOL_generational_leaps_desc:0 "Warfare is a constantly shifting target. While planning has always remained indispensable, it has become clear that even the best laid opeartions frequently run into tactical snares when theory meets practicality. Refinements to the Imperial High Command's doctrines will require further wargaming, as well as multiple scenarios for each phase of an operation, to ensure the greatest chance of success."
  SOL_communication_key:0 "Communication is Key"
  SOL_communication_key_desc:0 "An army without the ability to communicate is one that will perish without firing a shot. Although the use of message scribes has been a tradition of the Equestrian and later Imperial military for generations, they are less efficient and more costly to replace than a properly designed radio. Further pushing for the modernization of communications between armies will further aid our forces' survival."
  SOL_strike_iron:0 "Strike a Hot Iron"
  SOL_strike_iron_desc:0 "Sometimes it is almost impossible for artillery or hoof infantry to fill in a breach within the lines of battle. Whether the enemy begins to pour in faster than reinforcements can arrive, or the terrain is unsuitable for standard movement, the result is the same. Completely motorizing our response groups will allow for comparitively instant reactions and also allow for miniature spearhads on the offense, as well."
  SOL_hoof_of_empress:0 "The Hoof of the Empress"
  SOL_hoof_of_empress_desc:0 "Artillery has been a mainstay of the battlefield for generations, but with modern advancements, it can act as the primary swing of any army's forces. In its own way, overwhelming an enemy with unending fire has beauty to it. Like the Empress, its impact is felt far and wide. Designing our military around ideals of complete destruction will quickly win us wars."
  SOL_showering_battlefield:0 "Showering the Battlefield"
  SOL_showering_battlefield_desc:0 "Why should we waste soldiers' lives when they can be put to use elsewhere? Our empire is the most industrially and militarily capable nation on Equus, yet we choose to spend effort on killing servants of the Empress instead of utilizing our strengths. We can merely build bigger and better cannons, and saturate an entire battlefield in shells. We shall drown our enemies in gunpowder and lead!"
  SOL_combined_assaults:0 "Combined Assaults"
  SOL_combined_assaults_desc:0 "Enemy emplacements may sometimes be too heavily fortified for a standard infantry attack, and when out of range of our artillery or in areas incompatible with tanks, a true danger to the success of a mission. Through massed charges combined with more manueverable, armored vehicles, assaults against strongholds can still hope to overcome the enemy, regardless of their situation."
  SOL_holy_napalm_applications:0 "Holy Napalm Application"
  SOL_holy_napalm_applications_desc:0 "Fire is the purest of all weapons, as it ignores guilt and never plays favorites. As She Who Raises the Sun, the Empress uses this truth to separate the loyal and the disloyal, the sheep from the wolves. However, it is not the only use. The battlefield is filled with threats to the Empress, and compounds such as "napalm" provide the perfect method of delivery of some of her holy justice!"
  SOL_mundane_magic:0 "Magic in Mundane Form"
  SOL_mundane_magic_desc:0 "As our enemies' efforts to overwhelm us with armor continue, we must look to apply further ways of piercing even their toughest shells. Although many do not see it as something glamorous or enticing, the work of ensuring our troops can crack the armored corps of any foe is a necessary, if dull, task that shall be rewarded by the lives saved and an Empress shielded."
  SOL_war_games:0 "War Games"
  SOL_war_games_desc:0 "There are always new tactics that our enemies employ that may catch us off guard. While we cannot always predict them, we can always be prepared for them, and by initiating a constant series of war games in which the Imperial High Command participates, we will have practical experience in refining our own responses to the enemy, and see where we fall short, or where we can exploit a weakness of our foes."
  SOL_rapid_reloads:0 "Rapid Reloading Crews"
  SOL_rapid_reloads_desc:0 "The greatest issue with our cannons are simply that they fire too slowly. Although we can throw more ponies at the problem, the problem is inherent in the designs. Numerous measures for safety can get in the way of launching more judgement upon the enemy, so simply disposing of them will improve the rate of which our crews can fire. What's a lost limb compared to destroying a company of soldiesr?"
  SOL_invincible_spotlights:0 "Range to the Heavens"
  SOL_invincible_spotlights_desc:0 "There is nothing on the battlefield that can't be silenced by the deafening thunder of the Empress's cannons. While the enemy may try and hide, as techniques with artillery mature, we will be able to level stretches that were thought untouchable. Some of these applications to our cannon's barrels may also be useful for our anti-air defenses, so that we may reach fliers that could one time assault us with impunity."
  SOL_imperial_workhorses:0 "Workhorses of the Empire"
  SOL_imperial_workhorses_desc:0 "Ponies were created for the Empress, not the inverse. While Daybreaker leads us, we are also her faithful and unqestioning servants. Equestria saw the military as more than the tool it was and spent needless resources on safety. What is a servant without sacrifice? We shall overwhelm the enemy with sheer numbers, as it is the only way we can show our love for the God-Empress."
  SOL_accept_truth:0 "Accepting the Truth"
  SOL_accept_truth_desc:0 "As much as our generals still yearn for a day when large-scale infantry combat would decide wars in a single battle, reality has passed them by. Nations across the globe are adopting an armored corps which can run circles around infantry or artillery. If we are to keep up, we must further our own tank initiatives, so that we can overwhelm the enemy with unstoppable machines of the God-Empress's justice!"
  SOL_mobile_cannons:0 "Mobile Cannons"
  SOL_mobile_cannons_desc:0 "A weakness of artillery is its lack of durability, but there are other ways of propelling heavy cannons between locations on the battlefield. The tank chassis is a perfect bed for adapting and using the heaviest guns to which we have access, and by further improving the armor and drivetrain of specific models, we could one day achieve a fully mobile military, with little in the way of infantry need."
  SOL_speedy_fields:0 "Speed on the Field"
  SOL_speedy_fields_desc:0 "Our current motorization is adequate, but there are always places in which to improve. Behind the lines, supplies could arrive sooner, wounded soldiers delivered for healing faster, and information provided quicker, that demands we innovate on our vehicles. On the front, rapid reponses can never be hurt by an even speedier engine, and it will allow us to quickly fill gaps where needed."
  SOL_operational_art:0 "Operational Art"
  SOL_operational_art_desc:0 "Every plan has weaknesses, but it is a matter of seeing our own and discovering our enemy's that we can exploit them. On all levels of combat, from the simple skirmish to the grand campaign, we will combine our tactics and practical knowledge to determine the flaws in an enemy's attack, and counter like a knife through hot butter straight into their midst to destroy them utterly."
  SOL_streamlined_firearms:0 "Streamlined Firearms"
  SOL_streamlined_firearms_desc:0 "A firearm is a simple thing, at least to those who do not have to create them. Despite performing a basic task: shooting things, a gun is a marvel of engineering with various specialized parts that are required to function. However, many of these parts are superfluous, only allowing for slightly better comfort or functionality. Through their elimination, we shall satisfy the hunger of our ever-growing army."
  SOL_melt_shroud:0 "Melting the Shroud"
  SOL_melt_shroud_desc:0 "The Holy Flame is the symbol and might of the God-Empress herself. Since we have been baptized in her fire, we have sought ways to deliver the cleansing inferno to our enemies, that their sin may be burned like dross. While many soldiers may wish to personally deliver her flame in battle, mounting throwers to tanks will improve both their strength and durability, that we may immolate all that have been corrupted."
  SOL_mighty_hoofs:0 "Mighty Hoofs"
  SOL_mighty_hoofs_desc:0 "One of the longest standing issues within the former Equestrian military was a gap in enemy lines could be exploited. Although there were proponents of tank warfare, they were routinely marginalized. Today, though, they are no longer ignored, and the creation of a true force focused on armored warfare shall be created. Our tanks will be unmatched, and punch through any line they face!"
  SOL_only_statistics:0 "Only Statistics"
  SOL_only_statistics_desc:0 "The ponies of the God-Empress are numerous, and they are little more than tools to spread her glory across the world. Whether we achieve victory with a thousand losses or one hundred thousand, it is inconsequential in the grand vision of Daybreaker. If we throw enough bodies at a problem, we will always succeed. There will be more to replace them."
  SOL_reduced_standards:0 "Reduced Standards"
  SOL_reduced_standards_desc:0 "A soldier is meant to kill. A gun is meant to facilitate those requirements. It is a simple arrangement. Over time, that simplicity has been marred by various additional requirements, either in the gun itself or the manufacturing process, but these are pointless. Does it matter if a firearm may lack a safety, if it means the soldier can fire sooner?"
  SOL_modernized_knights:0 "Modernized Knights"
  SOL_modernized_knights_desc:0 "In the centuries after Nightmare Moon was defeated, orders of ponies dedicated to various virtues such as honor, humility, and generosity sprung up, and in times of war, could be called upon to serve the Empress with their full dedication. While the armored knight of old is antiquated, its concept in a heavily armored, mobile spearhead has not. Affixing our tanks to these ideals will lead to further victories upon the battlefield."
  SOL_mage_army:0 "An Army of Mages"
  #SOL_mage_army_desc:0 "Basing our doctrine on usage of magic will allow us to tap into the power of our mages, with devastating results for the enemy."
  SOL_mage_army_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] is filled with a race entirely dedicated to magic. Unicorns are plentiful and many are willing to serve the Empress in any capacity within the Militarium. Through harnessing the innate magic within both them and the other two races of ponies, we will gain an edge no other military could hope to achieve. Our mages' power will be unlimited!"
  SOL_mysterious_magic:0 "Mysteries of Magic"
  SOL_mysterious_magic_desc:0 "Ponies are a magical race, but that does not mean that everything that can be done with magic has been understood, or even discovered. We have many talented mages and scribes within [ROOT.GetNameDef], and it would be foalish to not utilize their talents. Further grants and test subjects will be given to our mages, that they may further our abilities in the arcane for war."
  SOL_evocation_schools:0 "Schools of Evocation"
  SOL_evocation_schools_desc:0 "There are many classes of spells, ranging from those that can dazzle and amaze, to forbidden spells that can raise the dead. One of the most prominent, especially with the ascension of the Empress, is evocation. Training all prospective unicorns in standard evocation rules will lead to ponies that channel little shards of the Empress's might themselves!"
  SOL_magitech_integration:0 "Magitech Integration"
  SOL_magitech_integration_desc:0 "Although they're not directly related, magic and mundane technology are inherently linked with each other, as one can support the other to shore up weaknesses. While the Magical Energy Weapon is a pinnacle of the mundane and arcane working in unison, we must further improve upon its platform, integrating components with magical energy to streamline our processes and drown our enemies with magic."
  SOL_magical_adaptations:0 "Magical Adaptations"
  SOL_magical_adaptations_desc:0 "For centuries, the standard military thinking involved earth ponies and pegasi. While magical, they did not count on unicorns for generalist work, rather specialist missions. With the advent of modern magical technology, that process must change, so that we can utilize the promises of magic to their fullest extent."
  SOL_next_gen_spells:0 "Next-Generation Spells"
  SOL_next_gen_spells_desc:0 "The crystals that power our magical weaponry are finicky and prone to issues with providing the power necessary to discharge spells down-range. Further refining the design of the crystal matrices used plus creating tailored spells for guns will only further increase the lethality of our troops on the battlefield."

  ###Navy###
  SOL_rebuild_admiralty:0 "Rebuild the Imperial Admiralty"
  SOL_rebuild_admiralty_desc:0 "Within the old Equestrian Navy, heritage meant more than actual skill. A number of nobles have clung to their positions as grand admirals, stifling innovation and the ability for qualified ponies to replace them. It is time they are shown the door, and those who have actually had combat experience be elevated to their circle instead that we may begin expanding the fleet."
  SOL_scraping_barrels:0 "Scraping the Barrels"
  SOL_scraping_barrels_desc:0 "Although we are not lacking for vessels thus far, we must keep in mind other countries' navies and how they could catch us off guard. Over the decades, a number of old models of ships have been mothballed and left rusting. Quick restorations of the hulls are possible, especially with magic, and we could fill any gaps in our squadrons while we construct newer designs."
  SOL_saltless_blood:0 "Salt-Free Blood"
  SOL_saltless_blood_desc:0 "With the cruft of the old grand admiralty removed, there are now gaps in the roster of those who can command our fleets. Thankfully, there is no shortage of able-minded ponies with the candor of youth that will invigorate our naval halls with fresh ideas and zealous devotion to Harmony."
  SOL_practical_needs:0 "Practical Needs"
  SOL_practical_needs_desc:0 "Regardless of where everypony stands within the Imperial Admiralty on naval doctrine, one thing is agreed upon. [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] is in desperate need of updated destroyer models. As time has gone on, it's become clear that these smallest vessels have much to provide, as they are flexible enough to guard coasts, fleets, or chase down other light ships. Maintaining their edge will ward our navy for years."
  SOL_strong_dissuasion:0 "A Strong Dissuasion"
  SOL_strong_dissuasion_desc:0 "While neither the largest or smallest ships, cruisers can hold their own for short periods of time against ships significantly heavier than them and can outgun any destroyers on the seas. While they cannot have the same presence as a battleship, they are easier to construct and generally are enough where a heavy gun is overkill. New models should be prioritized immediately."
  SOL_surrender_waves:0 "Surrendering the Waves"
  SOL_surrender_waves_desc:0 "In decades past, the dreadnought and later the battleship were the queen of the seas, but advancements in aviation and naval technology has given rise to the aircraft carrier. From afar, they can unleash their squadrons of planes and strike where even battleships cannot go. While they are in their infancy, they are the future and it would be best to adopt them while it gives us the advantage."
  SOL_crushing_sea:0 "Crushing the Sea"
  SOL_crushing_sea_desc:0 "In a decade, the aircraft carrier may be developed enough that they can challenge traditional ship warfare, but for the moment, the battleship is the queen of the waves. Continuing to base our tactics around large surface fleets with central flagships to intimidate or pound enemies into submission cannot steer us wrong. A carrier is useless if it at the bottom of the ocean, after all."
  SOL_mobile_airfields:0 "Mobile Airfields"
  SOL_mobile_airfields_desc:0 "Our current aircraft carriers are little more than repurposed dreadnoughts or cruisers with long decks strapped upon them. By designing from the ground up a hull that is based around planes, we can make them more efficient. They may lose some of their cabin space, but making the total deck space for planes larger will allow us to bring a small air base's worth of craft with us anywhere in the world."
  SOL_fillydelphia_rivalry:0 "Fillydelphian Rivalry"
  SOL_fillydelphia_rivalry_desc:0 "While Las Pegasus has been the primary shipyard that has constructed our ships, Fillydelphia and Manehattan also have capable infrastructure to provide for navy. They have mostly kept to civilian craft, and a small rivalry has sprung up between them. As Fillydelphia has had more experience with large ships, it is only natural to favor them for our carrier projects and leave Manehattan to their devices."
  SOL_semper_fi:0 "Semper Fi"
  SOL_semper_fi_desc:0 "With a revitalized navy, there comes a need for brave ponies that will serve on the fronts that the ships create when we must bring the fight for Harmony and Order to the other continents. While there have been ersatz marines in the past, it is time that we formalize the institution and recruit from the best of the navy so that we may conquer the beaches."
  SOL_expand_manehattan_dockyards:0 "Expand the Manehattan Dockyards"
  SOL_expand_manehattan_dockyards_desc:0 "Although it is much smaller than the Las Pegasus shipyards, Manehattan has a large and modern series of facilities for constructing ships. While it's remained civilian, it can easily be bought out and expanded to handle the needs of our growing navy. Some of the hulls laid can even be converted now into warships, saving both time, effort, and money."
  SOL_first_rates:0 "First-Rate Ships"
  SOL_first_rates_desc:0 "Among all the surface vessels, the battleship is the purest form of art. Massive, floating tools of destruction, these bear the heritage of the wooden warships of old. Nothing can challenge their guns and survive, but they can still be outpummeled or outmanuevered. Iterating on their designs to shore up these weaknesses will ensure we continue to terrorize any who wish to fight us at sea."
  SOL_birds_of_water:0 "Birds of the Water"
  SOL_birds_of_water_desc:0 "We may have all the carriers that we wish, but if we do not have the planes to fill them, our fleets will be useless. Although prototypes and early conversions of terrestrial aircraft have been utilized by our navies for some time, we must create true carrier-designed aircraft, and it will require extensive tweaking of our planes to do so."
  SOL_modern_sea:0 "The Modern Sea"
  SOL_modern_sea_desc:0 "We stand on the cusp of innovation in naval warfare. While other nations may still focus on the weapons of the past, we innovate toward a future where the battleship and battlecruiser are utterly pointless in one's arsenal. New breakthroughs in launching and storing our naval aircraft will lead to efficient utilization of our carriers, so that even our rivals will struggle to match us."
  SOL_grand_expeditions:0 "Grand Expeditions"
  SOL_grand_expeditions_desc:0 "To further the Empress's reach and ambitions, our forces will ultimately have to spread Harmony and Order to lands beyond Equus. Thus far, our military transports have mostly kept our coasts, thereby reducing the need for extensive redesigns. However, with a global spread of Order, we will need ships that can take us to the furthest reaches of the globe to enforce her will."
  SOL_floating_cities:0 "Floating Cities"
  SOL_floating_cities_desc:0 "As our experience increases in carrier warfare, our hulls have steadily increased in size to provide more room for crew and redundancy in systems, but our capacity has remained the same. There is little reason we cannot utilize these larger hulls for their true purpose: swarming the skies with fighters with which to deliver the Empress's justice."
  SOL_long_range_strikers:0 "Long Range Strikers"
  SOL_long_range_strikers_desc:0 "Our planet is much larger than Equus, and we will require our carriers to patrol and protect whatever territory the Empress claims as her own. Prototypes for carriers with retooled interiors and subsystems have shown promise for their improved engine power and fuel capacity. This does limit the number of planes they can hold, but that is a small price in extending the Empress's reach."
  SOL_roach_guards:0 "Roach Guards"
  SOL_roach_guards_desc:0 "The Admiralty has been approached by a rather odd proposition by one of our destroyer captains. As our navy expands, we will require numerous smaller vessesl to protect our capital ships. This concept, a "roach" light ship is novel, and while it may mean we lose many more, we will always have more to replace them. It may be unpopular among crews, but guarding our Empress comes above their comfort."
  SOL_magisteel_plating:0 "Magisteel Plating"
  SOL_magisteel_plating_desc:0 "For centuries, skilled smiths have bonded magic with various metals as they forged them to further increase the strenth of the armor. Normally this is too taxing to do on large ships, but some students in Fillydelphia have devised a way to use matrix crystals to store the magic and discharge them into the steel forging process. Implementing this will make our capital ships even more deadly against the enemy."
  SOL_imperial_dreadnoughts:0 "Imperial Dreadnoughts"
  SOL_imperial_dreadnoughts_desc:0 "Continued advancements in design permit the mounting of heavier armor and guns on our battleships than ever before. Crews protected by the thick plating and powerful cannons have nothing to fear from the enemy, as anything that comes up against one of our battleships will be destroyed! These beasts of the sea truly deserve the term of dreadnought, for dread is an anathema to their captains!"
  SOL_swarms_upon_sea:0 "Swarms upon the Sea"
  SOL_swarms_upon_sea_desc:0 "To truly rule the waves, we must control the skies above. When an enemy fleet is foalish enough to engage our navy, they will be drowned out in bombs and bullets, for our carriers will unleash entire wings of planes before they can react and leave them as nothing but scrap upon the bottom of the ocean!"
  SOL_old_guns:0 "The Old Guns"
  SOL_old_guns_desc:0 "While it may be seen as quaint or antiquated by some countries, there is little that can truly challenge the firepower of a battleship. We may now be challenged by carrier-based fleets or submarine wolfpacks, but we can simply burn them out with the firepower that a single battleship brings. They cannot hope to defeat us when we can pummel them into sunken wrecks!"
  SOL_adapt_tide:0 "Adapt with the Tide"
  SOL_adapt_tide_desc:0 "The landscape of naval combat has changed drastically from the turn of the millennium. No more are task forces designed around a single or pair of heavy battleships, but instead it is a mobile, long-range strike force that is comprised of a number of nimble screening ships and a few carriers. Although these seem weak, they can handle anything thrown at them with their versatility. The age of the battleship is over."
  SOL_steady_going:0 "Steady as She Goes"
  SOL_steady_going_desc:0 "Although naval warfare is continuing to evolve, the battleships are far from becoming obsolete. New advancements in armor and weapons continue to allow our mighty dreadnoughts to keep pace with nimbler, carrier-based strike forces. Wherever our battleships reside, they are unstoppable forces of nature that cannot be matched. The age of the battleship will not go down without a fight!"
  SOL_practical_reductions:0 "Practical Reductions"
  SOL_practical_reductions_desc:0 "A battleship is a fearsome creation that takes significant amounts of effort to bring to fruition. Many of the delays in building the weapons that the Empress requires are based around safety standards and redundant subsystems in case of failure. Recorded rates of said failures are negligible among our captains, so there is little reason to keep them. Cutting a few corners will benefit us all in the long run."
  SOL_sea_fortress:0 "A Fortress upon the Seas"
  SOL_sea_fortress_desc:0 "Although our battleships are grand, they are not worthy of one being given the honor of being the Empress's personal flagship. If it is to be worthy of her, it must be far larger, far more powerful, and far more imposing, than any ship we have yet conceived. It must be unsinkable and undefeatable. Plans have already been drawn up to create something magnificent, well into the future."
  SOL_sun_never_sets:0 "The Sun will Never Set"
  SOL_sun_never_sets_desc:0 "Our navy is a sight to behold, unmatched in its power and capable of reaching the very ends of the world to exact the Empress's retribution. As we spread Harmony to the world, furthered by our ships' unstoppable might, we will be able to truly say that the Sun will never cease its blessing and protection of the Empire!"

  ###Air Force###
  SOL_sky_domain:0 "Domain of the Sky"
  SOL_sky_domain_desc:0 "The need for an Imperial Airforce is becoming more apparent by the day. Equestria was content to have a few volunteer wings and to conscript the Wonderbolts where necessary, but to fend off our enemies, we require something far more professional. As one of the Empire's races can literally fly, it is only natural that we come to dominate the skies."
  SOL_abolish_wonderbolts:0 "Abolish the Wonderbolts"
  SOL_abolish_wonderbolts_desc:0 "The Wonderbolts are outspoken supporters of the old regime and have made it known that they are against everything for which Daybreaker stands. Therefore, if they wish to poke the hornets' nest, they shall face the consequences. From this moment forth, they are no more, and a loyal, Solarist group shall take their place. The Solarbeams sounds appropriate."

  ###Ministry of Defense###
  SOL_airfields2:0 "Airfields of Southern Equestria"
  SOL_airfields2_desc:0 "In an effort to defend ourselves in case of war, we should construct a series of inter-connecting airports, so that if conflict comes to [ROOT.GetNameDef], we shall have the ability to rapidly respond and spread out our air force to cover the skies. As a bonus, the general commerce of these regions will be improved through air traffic."
  SOL_airfields:0 "Airfields of Central Equestria"
  SOL_airfields_desc:0 "As one of the first efforts of the Ministry of Defence, a series of air bases shall be constructed throughout the central plains of [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [CRY.GetNameDef], so that there will be more coverage over our skies if war were to break out. Additionally, this will provide valuable experience to the ponies who may one day become our next generation of pilots."
  SOL_canterbbean_grinder:0 "The Canterbbean Grinder"
  SOL_canterbbean_grinder_desc:0 "Our southern island territories are woefully underdefended and the military infrastructure is poor and wholly inadequate. If an enemy of [ROOT.GetNameDef] were to successfully navigate their way through the island chains of the Canterbbean, we would struggle to respond to them. We will construct further naval infrastructure in the region, so that we can station larger fleets to protect our waters."
  SOL_vanhoover_stations:0 "Vanhoover Stations"
  SOL_vanhoover_stations_desc:0 "Vanhoover lies across a narrow stretch of water separating [OLE.GetNameDef] and our territory. If the [OLE.GetAdjectiveCap] territory were to be used as a staging ground for invasion, we would have little time to respond and scramble our defenses in Luna Bay. As a measure of protection, we shall construct a series of forts and bases along the coast, so we may ward off any unexpected aggression."
  SOL_north_naval_games:0 "Naval Games of the North"
  SOL_north_naval_games_desc:0 "The waters of Northern Equus are treacherous and have claimed a number of ships in the centuries since the settlement of the Griffish Isles. However, other nations patrol those seas, and we must be prepared for war with them. Extensive naval games to learn the terrain and weather conditions will prepare us for just that eventuality."
  SOL_changeling_menace:0 "Anti-Changeling Tactics"
  SOL_changeling_menace_desc:0 "The bugs are brutish, bloodthirsty, and merciless. Their magic lends them subterfuge, and more than one battle against them has been turned by supposed [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] arriving to only reveal themselves as changeling infiltrators. However, we have determined weaknesses in their magic. Every soldiers shall receive this training to spot deception in the field."
  SOL_operation_wasserkoenigin:0 "Operation Wasserkönigin"
  SOL_operation_wasserkoenigin_desc:0 "In the event of war with a cross-continental enemy, we must prepare ourselves for an inevitable slog through beachheads on their shorelines. Our forces have so far had little experience with the dangers of a naval invasion, and would do well to practice what would be required in an attack upon Griffonia or Zebrica, so that we may maintain our crown of the seas."
  SOL_variegated_survival_training:0 "Variegated Survival Training"
  SOL_variegated_survival_training_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] is a land filled with varied climates and dangers. A pony can travel a couple of hundred kilometers and see grand mountains, searing desert, sweltering jungle, and smothering forest. With so much opportunity to experience every possible condition, we should implement a series of survival training exercises to our forces so they can experience every environment imaginable."
  SOL_canterlot_fort_line:0 "The Canterlot Fort Line"
  SOL_canterlot_fort_line_desc:0 "Despite our efforts of training our soldiers, [CHN.GetLeader] has still managed to push us back.

  SOL_combined_arms_exercises:0 "Combined Arms Exercises"
  SOL_combined_arms_exercises_desc:0 "[CHN.GetNameDefCap], while focused primarily on tank warfare, has shown the benefit of combining all aspects of a military to coordinate as tightly as possible. While a tank army may punch through a front line, it is the infantry that shores it up and the planes that keep the tanks protected from the sky. We must adapt to these modern conditions, and pen tactics to overcome such obstacles."
  SOL_defense_in_order:0 "Defense in Order"
  SOL_defense_in_order_desc:0 "Enemies may come and fall, but the Empress is eternal. In her, Harmony is preserved through Order.

  SOL_tactics_of_destruction_desc:0 "Our enemies are numerous and we must be prepared for some of our rightful land being impinged upon. That does not mean we will go lightly. Empowering rabid adherents to Daybreaker and using scorched earth tactics when faced with overwhelming odds will ensure that our opponents will be left with nothing and will still suffer for every inch of that wasteland they hold!"

  ###Crystal Empire###
  SOL_mock_empire:0 "The Mock Empire"
  SOL_mock_empire_desc:0 "With the ascension of [ROOT.GetLeader] and the proclamation of [ROOT.GetNameDef], [CRY.GetNameDef] was the first to abandon us and forsake Harmony. [CRY.GetLeader] has remained antagonistic through continued refusal to submit to the Empress. Unlike our true empire, [CRY.GetNameDef] is nothing but a wasteland, barring a few cities. It is time they learn that returning to the fold is not optional."
  SOL_follow_sunrise_plan:0 "Follow Sunrise's Plan"
  SOL_follow_sunrise_plan_desc:0 "After speaking with the Empress, her Lady Inquisitor Sunrise Sparkle has rightly pointed out a connection that can be exploited. Her family still reigns on the throne of [CRY.GetNameDef], and news of her capture and enlightenment is conflicted with reports that she is on the run. If she were to play the innocent rebel, seeking shelter, she could accomplish far more than a simple show of strength."
  SOL_gesture_of_strength:0 "A Gesture of Strength"
  SOL_gesture_of_strength_desc:0 "As rightful [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] territory, [CRY.GetNameDef] has illegally seceded from the [ROOT.GetFaction] and has forfeited their right to recognition. However, the Empress is nothing but merciful, and shall give the foals in [CRY.GetName] a single chance of repentance. To show her might, somepony worthy will be sent as her represenative. There will be a simple message: submit or perish."
  SOL_royal_province:0 "The Royal Province"
  SOL_royal_province_desc:0 "Wisely, [CRY.GetNameDef] has folded and returned to be in Harmony with the rest of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. As her newest subjects, the crystal ponies have yet to be graced by the Empress. [CRY.GetLeader] has ensured that there will be proper preparation and ceremony as she begins her grand tour. A reminder of her power and majesty will ensure that the crystal ponies understand their place within Harmony."
  SOL_destroy_night_guard:0 "Destroy the Night Guard"
  SOL_destroy_night_guard_desc:0 "When the Empress ascended, much of Luna's Night Guard fled. Some scattered to Zebrica, others escaped to [EQC.GetNameDef], and yet more ran to [CRY.GetNameDef]. These rogue elements now combat our rightful rule and spread dangerous misinformation amongst the populace. Yet are not invisible and [ROOT.GetAgency] will easily root them out, permanently."
  SOL_umbrum_military_industrial_parks:0 "Umbrum Military Industrial Parks"
  SOL_umbrum_military_industrial_parks_desc:0 "The Umbrum Cage is a strategic point in the southern [CRY.GetName], as its mountains have remained untapped of the magical crystals that are abundant within the country. In an effort to improve the usefulness of [CRY.GetNameDef], a great manufactory shall be constructed to extract these crystals for the good of the Empress."
  SOL_family_visits:0 "Family Visits"
  SOL_family_visits_desc:0 "Although not by blood, Cadance is the niece of our Empress, and before [CRY.GetNameDef] deserted, they remained close. It has been some time since the Empress has properly visited her extended family, and while the royal family doesn't have the same influence they did, convincing Cadance to support us will only further our regime's legitimacy in the eyes of the populace."
  SOL_investments_in_empire:0 "Investments into the Empire"
  SOL_investments_in_empire_desc:0 "Much of [CRY.GetNameDef] is uninhabitated or severely underdeveloped compared to [ROOT.GetNameDef]. This severely weakens their ability to aid us in event of an attack upon our lands. As a show of grace, funds will be allocated from the [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] Treasury, to directly stimulate the [CRY.GetAdjectiveCap] economy and build a foundation for the future."
  SOL_update_northern_tactics:0 "Update Northern Tactics"
  SOL_update_northern_tactics_desc:0 "As it was locked in time for a thousand years, [CRY.GetNameDef] has remained woefully behind in many aspects of society, most notably, its military tactics. Shining Armor did much for improvement, but they are still behind where the Imperial High Command is. Through sharing some of our insights, we can provide them knowledge in general warfare, while we gain valuable experience in winter combat in return."
  SOL_establish_crystal_legion:0 "Establish the Crystal Legion"
  SOL_establish_crystal_legion_desc:0 "Still most soldiers who form the military of [CRY.GetNameDef] come from the populace, but that is dangerous while the regime is still aligning the nation with our own. As a reminder to whom they owe their loyalty, an elite force from our lands will be dispatched to remain in the Crystal City, only answerable to [CRY.GetLeader] and the Empress herself."
  SOL_monarchy_compliance:0 "Love's Loss"
  SOL_monarchy_compliance_desc:0 "As she is no longer ruler of [CRY.GetNameDef], Princess Cadance has been left with little to do. Even in her submission, she has remained resistant to the Empress's wisdom, but she has not yet seen the consequences of her actions. In her grace, the Empress has summoned Cadance to [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where she will learn the error of her ways. Soon, she will lovingly guide all to the Empress and Harmony."
  SOL_appoint_economic_advisors:0 "Appoint Economic Advisors"
  SOL_appoint_economic_advisors_desc:0 "There is a severe lack of qualified ponies within [CRY.GetNameDef] to run an economy. With the rapid onset of the Industrial Revolution, few were able to adapt to it fully and gain enough knowledge to be useful. Dispatching some of the brightest minds of the Imperial Court will further ensure compliance, and align the [CRY.GetAdjectiveCap] with our own in short order."
  SOL_retire_old_guard:0 "Retire the Old Guard"
  SOL_retire_old_guard_desc:0 "The Crystal Army is filled with a number of ponies still resistant to the Empress, and they have caused insubordination within the armed forces many times already. They are no longer required. Chief among their conspirators is Prince Shining Armor. Although he is too influential to execute, he can be relieved of duty, and his lackeys along with him. They should be thankful they are not shot instead."
  SOL_rouse_godhood:0 "Awaken Flurry to Her Deity"
  SOL_rouse_godhood_desc:0 "The Empress's young niece, Princess Flurry Heart is a naturally-born alicorn. This rarity is unprecedented, and her talents have so far been wasted. Only somepony born into deity could have had such a miraculous creation. If Flurry Heart will not be instructed in her birthright, then there is only one pony who can do so: our God-Empress."
  SOL_cadance_university:0 "Mi Amore Unversity"
  SOL_cadance_university_desc:0 "Education in the finer knowledge of Order and Harmony is lacking within [CRY.GetNameDef]. Establishing a new university, ostensibly dedicated to Princess Cadance will further draw in minds, where they can be corrected to understand the struggle that everypony is, and how they must defend the Empress with their last breath."
  SOL_polished_armor_arsenals:0 "Polished Armor Arsenals"
  SOL_polished_armor_arsenals_desc:0 "With some of the highest concentration of magical crystals on Equus, [CRY.GetNameDef] is ripe for experimentation and improvement of old magical weapon designs. To help safeguard the Empress, grants shall be given for establishing new manufacturing concerns, so that the weapons that fight for Harmony may bring as much Order to the world as possible."
  SOL_imperial_mind:0 "The Imperial Mind"
  SOL_imperial_mind_desc:0 "As the crystal ponies have adapted to life under the Empress, they have grown more aligned with the great needs of Harmony and Order. Although at one point they would have decried reforms as unethical or immoral, they now see that much must be sacrificed on the altar of Harmony. Already their economy is aligned, and now their scientists are prodding the limits of their race, ethical quandries be damned."
  SOL_imperial_guardian:0 "The Imperial Guardian"
  SOL_imperial_guardian_desc:0 "As much of the land is frozen wasteland, [CRY.GetNameDef] is ideally situated to protect our northern territories. Without the nagging naysayers of Shining Armor's clique and with the invigorated youth who have accepted the Empress, [CRY.GetNameDef] shall be a ward against all Disharmony and Chaos in the artict fringes as well as be our shield in times of trouble elsewhere on Equus."

  ###Bats###
  SOL_fire_and_brimstone:0 "Fire and Brimstone"
  SOL_fire_and_brimstone_desc:0 "Thestrals have been behind issues and pains within the rest of Equus for generations, which originated when they first sided with Nightmare Moon. Because of her rebellious nature, they have been tainted. There is no redemption for them, for they will always be opposed to us. Therefore, we must show them that we are their superiors, and by the only language they will understand."
  SOL_what_homes:0 "What Homes?"
  SOL_what_homes_desc:0 "In the past, thestrals resided across Equus, with the only remnant of that being the settlements within Hollow Shades that we have yet to penetrate. However, upon which they have constructed their new homes is rightful Imperial territory. They sided with Nightmare Moon a thousand years ago. They have never integrated back into our society. What right do they have to anything within our Empire?"
  SOL_what_jobs:0 "What Jobs?"
  SOL_what_jobs_desc:0 "While they might have been useful, as some have called them, in improving the economy, thestrals run far too much of a risk in sharing sensitive information with our enemies. They are nosy, they are forever curious, and worst of all, they will speak to whomever will ask them their secrets. Our only solution will be economically painful in the short term, but yield our safety in the future."
  SOL_burn_bats:0 "§OBURN THE BATS!§!"
  SOL_burn_bats_desc:0 "Thestrals, the "Children of the Night," are a danger to us all. They spread lies, deceptions, and sew discontent against the Empress wherever they live. All attempts to reason with them will only end in failure.\n\nThere is only solution to them: §OFire§!."
  SOL_enlighten_darkness:0 "Enlightening the Darkness"
  SOL_enlighten_darkness_desc:0 "Thestrals may be considered "Children of the Night," but they are still ponies. Incredibly misguided ponies, but ponies nonetheless. To that end, is it not the role of the Empress to ensure that they are shown the error of their ways and given a chance to turn from their error? A small number already obey here, so it is only a matter of opening the gates to let them all in to a greater understanding of her."
  SOL_second_class_employers:0 "Second-Class Employers"
  SOL_second_class_employers_desc:0 "Although thestrals should contribute to our economy, they must keep to themselves. Their minds are clouded by their ties to Nightmare Moon, and could very well inadvertently lead one of our loyal citizens away from a proper respect to the Empress. As they simply cannot contribute to society as a normal pony can, it is reasonable to allow separate work structures, to accomodate their lowly contributions."
  SOL_mandatory_education:0 "Mandatory Education"
  SOL_mandatory_education_desc:0 "The greatest error that reamins unrectified is that the thestrals are still allowed to instruct their young in their corrupt ways. This will only spawn further generations of rebels and lovers of the night and darkness. Some may even defect to those who believe that Nightmare Moon is alive and will save them. There is a simple solution. They must learn what it means to not be a thestral."
  SOL_useful_servants:0 "Useful Servants"
  SOL_useful_servants_desc:0 "Although thestrals can never achieve what the rest of ponykind has, due to their dark and corrupt nation, they can still contribute. They are witty and quick in their thoughts, no matter how debased, and have shown they have aptitude for menial or physical labor. Loosening our previous restrictions on them will only serve to benefit us into the future."
  SOL_peninsula_of_damned:0 "Peninsula of the Damned"
  SOL_peninsula_of_damned_desc:0 "Although thestrals made their ancestral home within the South-Eastern Peninsula, they are not the only natives who inhabit the region. Both settlers from Northern Equus and the Neighua tribes call the peninsula home. Aside from the port cities, they languish in the interior in unseen squalor. Solving the issue will require multiple steps, but they shall taste the Empress's mercy before long!"
  SOL_prison_of_fire:0 "Prison of Fire"
  SOL_prison_of_fire_desc:0 "The Badlands are desolate, but they are rich with resources that remain unexploited. It would be too much to ask our citizens to suffer in the extreme conditions within, but not all ponies within the Empire are worthy of respect. Soon, sprawling complexes across the Badlands will hold thousands of prisoners who will spend their short lives toiling for the benefit of the Empire."
  SOL_peaks_of_wealth:0 "Peaks of Wealth"
  SOL_peaks_of_wealth_desc:0 "Across the mountain ranges in the South-East, there are many that have yet to be fully explored and surveyed. A logical place to begin would be where workers will be plentiful, and [30.GetName] will be the perfect staging point to begin extraction of additional resources for the betterment of the Empire's war machine. The thestrals should be thankful we provide them with any jobs at all."
  SOL_remote_no_more:0 "Remote No More"
  SOL_remote_no_more_desc:0 "The jungles of the South-East are some of the most poorly developed and connected places within the Empire. Much of the difficulty in improving them lies in the lack of infrastructure. While it may take excessive effort and be expensive, finally connecting the major centers together will only allow for simpler expansion in the future."
  SOL_expand_oil_fields:0 "Expand the Oil Fields"
  SOL_expand_oil_fields_desc:0 "Deep within the jungle lay untapped wells of the most precious liquid: oil. Due to the remoteness and difficulty of extracting, the fields so far have lain untapped, as the cost and the risk to pony life was too great for Equestrian officials. However, we have an untold number of prisoners who can perform the heavy work. What does it matter if we lose a few thousand in the process of feeding our tanks?"
  SOL_modern_south_east:0 "The Modern South-East"
  SOL_modern_south_east_desc:0 "Just because the South-East has historically remained backward doesn't mean that it always must be so. There are ponies across the peninsula who yearn to contribute to the Empire, and we shall grant them that request. Large injections of bits shall stimulate the economy of the region, and soon it will be a shining example of the Empress's charity and gift of prosperity."
  SOL_moonspeaker_tax:0 "Moonspeaker Tax"
  SOL_moonspeaker_tax_desc:0 "A small sect of thestrals, the Moonspeakers, are the priests of a religion centered around Nightmare Moon. They claim it is to Luna, but they are one and the same. However, they contain within their temple in [30.GetName] a repository of knowledge that rivals that of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. They shall be allowed to continue their worship, but they must permit outside eyes to see their works or face the Empress's justice."
  SOL_replanting_jungle:0 "Replanting the Jungle"
  SOL_replanting_jungle_desc:0 "As the only region on Equus that is the right climate for rubber trees, the South-East is an critical center of rubber production. As ponies have slowly expanded inward, some of these forests of rubber trees have been cleared or damaged, and if it continues, will stifle what can be used by the Empress. Extensive replanting efforts shall commence, that we will never run dry of tires for our vehicles."

  ###New Mareland###
  SOL_force_jet_sets_hoof:0 "Force Jet Set's Hoof"
  SOL_force_jet_sets_hoof_desc:0 "As a colony that was entirely funded by the Empress's purse when it first began, [EQC.GetNameDef] is a rightful crown colony of [ROOT.GetNameDef], and has unlawfully rejected our control. Governor Jet Set was supposed to bring it in line, but he has abandoned his calling and joined with rebels. It is time that a message is sent. A single offer of grace shall be given, or they will be wiped out."
  SOL_ensuring_loyalty:0 "Ensuring Loyalty"
  SOL_ensuring_loyalty_desc:0 "With [EQC.GetNameDef] rightfully within the [ROOT.GetFaction], there are those who worry that its distance from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will lead to consistent unrest and rebellion. Jet Set has proven that he requires guidance in maintaining order, so we shall dispatch a trusted pony, somepony capable. They will enforce the Empress's will, regardless of how much it is disliked."
  SOL_smooth_transitions:0 "Smooth Transitions"
  SOL_smooth_transitions_desc:0 "Jet Set has wisely chosen to accept the Empress's representative, and has recently communicated with [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] requesting further support for aligning his administration. Not only shall he receive what he requests, but a personal visit to the Empress is in order. After all, a reminder of whom he serves will jog his memory of how much he has been pardoned."
  SOL_faiths_reward:0 "Faith's Reward"
  SOL_faiths_reward_desc:0 "Arcane Nova has been a quick study since her rise within the Militarium, and she is zealous for enforcing the will of the Empress. With her discovery of Jet Set's true involvement with the rebels in [EQC.GetNameDef], it was only a matter of time before she would be determined worthy to lead the colony instead. Her fire for the Empress will ignite the nation itself!"
  SOL_empresss_eyes:0 "Empress's Eyes"
  SOL_empresss_eyes_desc:0 "History is not easily forgotten. While Jet Set has professed loyalty and his visit with the Empress left the impression that he will obey her, he did permit the secession of [EQC.GetNameDef]. While he may not require constant observation, his power must be limited, through replacing his yes-ponies with those loyal to the Empress."
  SOL_colonial_investments:0 "Colonial Stimulus"
  SOL_colonial_investments_desc:0 "When [GRD.GetNameDef] collapsed in 978 with the Republican Revolution, [EQC.GetNameDef] was hit extremely hard by the panicked sell-off by investors of their companies. While recovery is still underway, ponies still suffer. Injecting capital into building projects will at least provide temporary aid and provide a new understanding of the Empress's benevolence."
  SOL_homegrown_plan:0 "Homegrown Economic Recovery Plan"
  SOL_homegrown_plan_desc:0 "As a pony closer to the struggles of [EQC.GetNameDef] than the Empress, Jet Set has proposed a sweeping series of economic reforms and adjustments that will gear the economy of the colony to recovery as quickly as possible while maintaining a decent standard of living. While it will take longer, the benefit of a populace who has been 'heard' outweighs it, as they will follow without question."
  SOL_debt_council:0 "Imperial Debt Council"
  SOL_debt_council_desc:0 "The collapse of [EQC.GetNameDef]'s economy is clear evidence that they are unable to properly control their fiscal policies. Tying themselves too closely to [GRD.GetNameDef] was a ticking time bomb, and they are now suffering the consequences. Radical restructuring is needed. A council shall be formed, and whatever they deem necessary shall be done. No matter the suffering."
  SOL_fund_sunset_plays:0 "Fund Sunset Opera Performances"
  SOL_fund_sunset_plays_desc:0 "The Sunset Opera House is one of the modern marvels of Griffonia, and a testament to the passion of ponies across the globe. With the economic troubles, it has been less used than was intended. However, it is the perfect podium for expounding truths about our Empress. Approved plays will soon be performed there. Ponies will learn to love their Empress through song and poem!"
  SOL_personnel_support:0 "Personnel Support"
  SOL_personnel_support_desc:0 "[EQC.GetNameDefCap]'s armed forces have a dangerous amount of independence from [ROOT.GetNameDef], and have accepted such threats as zebra and thestrals into their midst. Unsurprisingly, anti-Order ideas run rampant through the organization, and it is a wonder they obey any orders. Arcane Nova has already provided name suggestions. There is little reason to deny her."
  SOL_allies_in_high_places:0 "Allies in High Places"
  SOL_allies_in_high_places_desc:0 "Jet Set has a number of contacts within the nobility that could provide useful assistance to him as he leads [EQC.GetNameDef]. Of course, he does not feel the need to reach out to them, as the colony is running well enough. However, some of his friends are much more invested in the Empress than he is. Assigning them to him will further curtail any thoughts of independence."
  SOL_expand_sunset_university:0 "Expand the University of Sunset"
  SOL_expand_sunset_university_desc:0 "As one of the only pony universities in Southern Griffonia, Sunset University has become more of a central pillar to education in [EQC.GetNameDef] since it returned to the fold. Students from within the Empire have begun to travel in exchange programs, and this should be encouraged. Sharing of the proper [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] mindset will transform [EQC.GetAdjectiveCap] from within!"
  SOL_griffon_workers:0 "Griffon Workers"
  SOL_griffon_workers_desc:0 "There is not an insignificant griffon minority within [EQC.GetNameDef] who have been historically marginalized. While their ultimate well-being is not our concern, they are a large enough body that employing them for labor will benefit all of ponykind. And for significant discounts, too."
  SOL_strip_mine_bauxite:0 "Strip Mine the Bauxite"
  SOL_strip_mine_bauxite_desc:0 "[EQC.GetNameDefCap] rests on extensive veins of aluminium, running throughout the colony. As it is mostly tied up in high-purity bauxite, it is ripe for the taking, but regulations have prevented much of this from being exploited. However, the Empress requires aluminium for her air force, and no amount of troublesome red tape will prevent it!"
  SOL_church_of_day:0 "Church of the Day-Goddess"
  SOL_church_of_day_desc:0 "Groups of members of the Solaris Cultus have recently emigrated from within the Empire to [EQC.GetNameDef] and Arcane Nova has welcomed them with open arms. Although they have only been there months, their numbers have swelled. Officially sanctioning this religion will encourage further loyalty and zealotry to the Empress and unite the land behind her."
  SOL_united_goal:0 "A United Goal"
  SOL_united_goal_desc:0 "As it is stuck on a foreign continent, [EQC.GetNameDef] is in a precarious position. In a wise move, Arcane Nova has returned to [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to speak directly to many of her peers in the Imperial Palace. If the colony is to survive, it must mimic the Empress in every way, so that our goal of Harmony and Order will prosper across the seas!"
  SOL_homeland_investments:0 "Investments from the Homeland"
  SOL_homeland_investments_desc:0 "As the economy of [EQC.GetNameDef] has recovered, interest in expansion into Griffonia has interested many companies based in Equus. If we are to maintain a strong hoofhold in Griffonia, providing grants and funding for these interested corporations will encourage them to obey and expand out to encompass the greater Empire's sphere."
  SOL_station_legions:0 "Station the Southern Legion"
  SOL_station_legions_desc:0 "Although there are a number of loyal ponies within [EQC.GetNameDef]'s military, they still have their chain of command to go through. As an insurance policy, one of the Empress's personal guard regiments will be established and dispatched to the colony. They will only answer to [EQC.GetLeader], so that the Empress's will shall always be enforced."
  SOL_cadet_militarium:0 "Cadet Militarium Branch"
  SOL_cadet_militarium_desc:0 "The instruction methods of the old regime in [EQC.GetNameDef] were woefully inadequate for the Empress's standards. Rather than fix what is broken, it shall be reborn instead. Instructors from [ROOT.GetNameDef] are already underway, and they will form a new branch of the Militarium, dedicated entirely to training a new generation of soldiers utterly loyal to Daybreaker."
  SOL_prisoner_restructuring:0 "Prisoner Restructuring"
  SOL_prisoner_restructuring_desc:0 "With the inspections of the government and institutions that have taken place under Arcane Nova, there is no shortage of guilty who have been detained in jail cells across [EQC.GetNameDef]. Rather than execution or rotting in prison, they could be far more useful for economic recovery. Working them to death will fix the country and solve a prisoner population problem to boot."
  SOL_refuge_in_sun:0 "Refuge in the Sun"
  SOL_refuge_in_sun_desc:0 "[EQC.GetNameDefCap] is blessed with a more pleasant climate than that of most of Equus. The Empress has used her Sun to shine light and protection into every corner of the colony. Due to this, hopefuls from across Equus have started to flock to [EQC.GetNameDef], and keeping the doors open wide will build a truly Imperial society, one pony at a time."
  SOL_economic_opportunity:0 "Land of Economic Opportunity"
  SOL_economic_opportunity_desc:0 "In an effort to further encourage economic recovery, [EQC.GetLeader] has approved reduction of taxes and grants for corporations and businesses that wish to relocate or expand into [EQC.GetNameDef]. Tax havens are despicable, but if it allows for restoring the might of our colony, then it will be tolerable. For now."
  SOL_world_station:0 "Station of the World"
  SOL_world_station_desc:0 "[EQC.GetNameDefCap] is located on the tip of Southern Griffonia, which allows it to control shipping going north from Zebrica or the East as well as be a short hop to the shores of [HIP.GetNameDef] or other regions of Griffonia. Constructing strategic military bases will give us the upper hoof if we must defend ourselves from the griffons, and provides defense for our weaker brethren."
  SOL_joint_military_expeditions:0 "Joint Military Expeditions"
  SOL_joint_military_expeditions_desc:0 "Although small compared to the Solaris Militarium, [EQC.GetNameDef]'s military is filled with brilliant officers. Our own captains could learn much from them, and them from us. Through organizing consistent wargames between our two militaries, we will further advance our tactics while providing them valuable experience in war for when it eventually reaches them."

  ###Puerto Caballo###
  SOL_change_management:0 "Change in Management"
  SOL_change_management_desc:0 "When the Cocktail regime was re-established in [PCB.GetNameDef], it was under the expectation of loyalty to the Empress. They have betrayed that trust, and they now willfully partake in the Sun's protection without giving the one who controls it the respect and obedience she deserves! They shall be given one chance at correcting their mistake, or their pathetic island will become nothing but a giant grave."
  SOL_communist_examples:0 "Altering the Deal"
  SOL_communist_examples_desc:0 "Although it is nascent compared to the haven of communism that is [STG.GetNameDef], [PCB.GetNameDef] has had a storied history with Marksists and recently endured an attempted coup. There is an undercurrent of sedition and disgruntlement with the Empress and it will not stand to let it continue. Ponsé Cocktail may have been popular, but he allowed this rot to set in. A more capable pony will resolve this instead."
  SOL_coercion_campaign:0 "Watching the Dog"
  SOL_coercion_campaign_desc:0 "Ponsé Cocktail has remained the popular leader of [PCB.GetNameDef] for a number of years, and while he has his reservations, he is capable enough that replacing him would be more effort than necessary. However, he cannot be left to his own devices, especially with the risk of a communist coup still possible. He need not worry. The Empress will watch his career with great interest."
  SOL_naval_staging_grounds:0 "Naval Staging Grounds"
  SOL_naval_staging_grounds_desc:0 "As [PCB.GetNameDef] is located within the southern Fire Sea and just north of the Canterbbean, its size permits it to be the perfect location for stationing some of the Empress's Imperial Navy. Not only will this provide us with a stronger position on the sea passages to Zebrica, but it will provide a visible presence of the Empress's might, in case of insurrection on the island."
  SOL_plumb_mountain_depths:0 "Plumb the Depths of the Mountains"
  SOL_plumb_mountain_depths_desc:0 "The majority of [PCB.GetNameDef] is jungle or farmland, although there is a small range near the capital. Although the majority of exports are rubber or sugar, the mountain itself is filled with precious minerals that are waiting to be tapped. Since the attempted revolution of 1005, companies have avoided the island, but the Empress is shrewd. Our own funds shall extract these resources, only for ourselves."
  SOL_isle_of_sun:0 "Isle of the Sun"
  SOL_isle_of_sun_desc:0 "While the island is ultimately insignificant, with [PCB.GetNameDef] stabilized, it is time that its autonomy be ended. There is little reason for the ponies, who have had their lives blessed by the warmth and protection of the Sun, should remain apart from her. Formally offering statehood will simplify administration going forward."

  ###Diplomacy###
  SOL_imperial_diplomatic_corps:0 "Imperial Diplomatic Corps"
  SOL_imperial_diplomatic_corps_desc:0 "We are not alone on this planet. While every knee should bow to the Empress and acknowledge her right to rule, it will take time for the minds of mortals and non-ponies to accept their inevitable fate. In the meantime, we should at least make over gestures of working with the international community, and we shall establish a department in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to handle all future communication with other nations."
  SOL_sustenance_workers:0 "Workers for Sustenance"
  SOL_sustenance_workers_desc:0 "[DRG.GetNameDefCap] can barely be considered a country, and even less of one that has any clout upon the international stage. Our Empress could wipe them from the face of the planet without a second thought, but she is generous. If they can agree to provide for us, we shall do all that we can to ensure that they can continue living. For now."
  SOL_insurance_policies:0 "Insurance Policies"
  SOL_insurance_policies_desc:0 "Although it is a backwater country [YAK.GetNameDef] nevertheless holds significant sway in the northern reaches of Equus. They have recently had spats between each other, with a splinter group forming [JAK.GetNameDef] and leading to more internal strife. We could easily swoop in and save the day, and promising to do so would keep the yaks under our hoof, so we can pressure them in just the right way."
  SOL_oil_existence:0 "Oil for Existence"
  SOL_oil_existence_desc:0 "Both [PLB.GetNameDef] and [PNG.GetNameDef] rest on significant deposits of oil across the Frozen North, yet they do not have the industrial capacity to utilize it, nor the ability to appreciate it for its true worth as fuel for our weapons of war. We will come with a simple proposal: submit it as tribute, or feel the wrath of the sun upon the frozen wastes."
  SOL_griffon_fealty:0 "Fealty of the Griffons"
  SOL_griffon_fealty_desc:0 "Just over two hundred years ago, Grover I officially established the small griffon towns along the north-eastern coast as Nova Griffonia, forever marring the otherwise pristine continent of Equus with a griffon claw. Now, this poor little colony has been left adrift, without the mighty [GRD.GetNameDef] to protect them. It would be simple to demand tribute of them. We just need to speak their language."
  SOL_reich_relations:0 "The Empire Across the Sea"
  SOL_reich_relations_desc:0 "There is not a single equal to our Empress, but there are a small number of nations who claim the title of Empire. Yet only [GRD.GetNameDef] is worthy of the Empress's attention, as they could realistically be the only one to prove to be a challenge.\n\nLet's put our best hoof forward, shall we?"

  solarreworked.32.t:0 "The Unthinkable Decision"
  solarreworked.32.d:0 "Although [ROOT.GetLeader] has barely ascended to the throne, there comes a question that has plagued the minds of many nobles and layponies alike in the old regime. When Princess Luna returned, there was a clear line of succession if something were to ever happen, but she is not suited to lead our land now, nor would she wish to. In the past, ideas of a regency council have been floated, but every time they were shot down, and [ROOT.GetLeader] has emphatically refused to agree to one for the one thousand years she has led [ROOT.GetNameDef] by her lonesome.\n\nWhile we do not expect her to perish, at the same time, it would be unwise to not have a formalized path in the unlikely event that she is wounded and unable to effectively lead until she heals. Given that Princess Luna's flight has left [ROOT.GetNameDef] in uncertain territory again, the matter should be pressed. It is not as if [ROOT.GetLeader] lacks ponies who know her well and would faithfully serve her, and who could use the power of being the official, designated regent to great effect."

  solarreworked.40.t:0 "An Offer that Can't be Refused"
  solarreworked.40.d:0 "Daybreaker sipped on her tea.\n\n"I can't believe that I'm being subjected to such an indignity!" her guest protested as he squirmed and fumed across the table from her. She merely smiled. As he glowered at her, she sipped again on her tea and then daintily set it aside, next to a large stack of tomes that had been placed on the right side of the table.\n\n"Chancellor Neighsay," she began, her voice dripping with false understanding, "I can completely see your point of view, but—" she shrugged "—I'm afraid that I will have to be insistent."\n\nNeighsay, his cyan eyes burning with fury, quivered and shook with rage. While his cheeks turned a deep shade of purple, he snarled, "I will NOT see the EEA turned into nothing more than a mouthpiece for whatever propaganda you purport to be scientific fact! We have standards! We have codes! We have—"\n\n"Almost no funding left," Daybreaker interjected, as she wrote something down on a napkin near her tea. She stuck out her tongue thoughtfully. "By my quick and dirty math, I'd say... you're at approximately... oh, five percent funding as when you entered." When she stated that, she sneered when he gagged in shock and his eyes went wide.\n\n"That's preposterous! I was assured—"\n\n"You were assured nothing! We met to discuss the new EEA curriculum, and how to properly educate our ponies, but you, sadly, believed that it was 'propaganda' and 'brainwashing'." She clicked her tongue. "It'd be such a shame that you'll be remembered as the last Chairpony of the EEA, and the one that led to its demise." Pursing her lips in an expression of mock compassion. "So sad," she pouted.\n\n"B-But I shall not—"\n\n"And that's four percent remaining."\n\n"Y-You can't—"\n\n"Three percent."\n\n"T-These are nothing but—"\n\n"Two percent."\n\n"Fine! Fine!" Neighsay screamed, throwing himself against the table, which made it rattle and spill tea onto his impeccably clean, red tunic. "I will implement the new curriculum! I can't have my legacy destroyed!"\n\nStaying silent for a moment, Daybreaker grinned. She sipped on her tea."

  ###Flavour Events###
  solarreworked.19.t:0 "Ascension"
  solarreworked.19.d_a:0 "At every corner, the enemy waits to leap upon me. I had thought that diplomacy would succeed, that Harmony would prevail on the merits of itself alone. But as the enemy pushes through my ponies' defenses, tears them down, and lays waste to all that we hold dear, I see the errors of my ways.\n\nThere is no negotiating with creatures that wish to see the light of Harmony, of Order, snuffed out. It is like talking with a brick wall. With a beast. They cannot comprehend our goodness, like we cannot stand their debased ways.\n\nWhispers in the morning remind me of my calling. I had lost my way. Benevolence cannot hope to stop the wave of evil that is on the horizon, the foe that wishes to see the utter annihilation of Harmony and destruction of everything for that has been striven for this last millennia.\n\nI will not allow this to be Harmony and Order's last gasp!\n\nOur enemy thinks me stupid, naive, but I have never been sharper. There is power in the sun!\n\nThere is warmth. There is protection. There is Order!\n\nI shall become all that I was meant to be. Let every last enemy of Harmony be burnt to §RASH!§!"
  solarreworked.19.d_b:0 "Everypony thought that the danger to Harmony would come from outside our nation, but they were wrong. Everypony was wrong. I was wrong. The only threat to Harmony, to Order and security, is those of us who refuse to follow my lead. For every last creature who clings to the rags of freedom that they believed was a tenet of Harmony prove they will forever endanger the protection I provide my ponies.\n\nFor too long, I had remained complacent and weak, believing that my ponies would always see the light. That troubles could be defused with words and compromise, but I see the truth now. Some are forever lost; anarchists in disguise, wishing to topple the stability that I have brought for a thousand years!\n\nBut I have seen the error of my ways now. Soft calls in the last light of day have reminded me of my purpose: I am here to protect my ponies, even when they do not appreciate it, and do not see what I do. What I see are enemies, within and without, that will stop at nothing to destroy our Order. Our Harmony!\n\nI will never allow this to be our last stand! They may think me weak and ineffectual, but I have never been more resolved!\n\nIn the sun, there is heat. There is security. There is Order!\n\nI shall become all that I was meant to be. Let every last enemy of Harmony be damned to Tartarus, where they shall burn for §RETERNITY!§!"
  solarreworked.19.d_c:0 "No! I will not back down! All around me are creatures who wish to end my reign! They see me for who I am! They FEAR me for who I am! These last thousand years will never be for naught! Every last soul who stands against me will feel my wrath!\n\nFor I am the morning light that they all rejoice to see! I am the Noonday Sun that caresses them in warmth and wraps them in comfort! I am the Shield of Harmony that will stop every fiery dart that is flung toward my ponies!\n\nCowards will flee, heroes will fall before me! I am the Princess—No, the GODDESS of the Sun! Mortals will wilt and fade like flowers in a field. Their lives are already forfeit if they stand against me!\n\nI am the Sun! I am the Dawn Star!\n\nWe are Daybreaker, and we shall see make them all §RKNEEL!§!"
  solarreworked.50.t:0 "A Sister's Love"
  solarreworked.50.d:0 ""Celestia! I came as fast as I could!" Luna exclaimed as she burst through the door of Celestia's makeshift office, which her sister had commandeered once the war began. As soon as she entered, her breath caught in her throat when she caught the various stacks of papers, reports, and charts that were scattered around the floor. A pair towered almost as high as the ceiling, which made her crane her neck upward to try and see the top of them.\n\n"Celestia?" she inquired. Somewhere buried in the piles of paper, her sister sneezed and a small cloud of paper flew toward the door from the desk in the middle of the room.\n\nWhen Celestia didn't bid her come, Luna rolled her eyes and trotted toward the desk and floated off the pages, which all appeared to be costs and recent casualty reports. "Sister, you must—" Her train of thought halted when she she saw Celestia. The alicorn's eyes were bloodshot, and her fur was tracked with mascara. Even her normally regal mane was completely frazzled and fraying. About a dozen cups of coffee were scattered across the desktop, along with some stains from spilled refills.\n\nLuna smirked.\n\nFinally peering up at her sister, Celestia whimpered, "Don't look at me."\n\n"Then, pray tell, why did you summon me?" calmly prodded Luna as she made her way around the desk.\n\n"I don't know!" Celestia retorted. Crossing her forelegs together, she shifted to avoid looking at Luna. She flinched when Luna rested a forehoof on her shoulder. Neither said anything, and Luna could feel the tension escalating in the room.\n\n"Is something wrong?" Luna gently nudged at last. Celestia shot a glance back at Luna as tears trickled down her cheeks. Luna hissed, while Celestia simply went back to gazing at her hooves.\n\nSwallowing deeply, Luna prodded, "'Tia... you have taken on so much. Mayhap you should—"\n\n"No!" bellowed Celestia, which made Luna's ears flatten in surprise. Celestia blushed. "I-I mean, I can't. They're my ponies, and I have to protect them, and I can't do that if—" Before she could finish, Luna leaned in and pulled Celestia out of the chair and onto the floor.\n\nLuna simply clicked her tongue as she wrapped her wings around Celestia. "You love them, 'Tia, which is why you fret." As tears started streaking down her own muzzle, Luna pulled up Celestia's chin with a wingtip, and she choked out, "But you can't do it on your own. Let me help. Please."\n\nAs she returned to an embrace, she heard Celestia sniffle, "Okay.""
  solarreworked.50.a:0 "Good talk."
  solarreworked.51.t:0 "A Sister's Fear"
  solarreworked.51.d:0 ""I—I just don't know, Lulu," Celestia sighed tiredly. Outside, she could hear the steady beat of hooves as ponies marched through the command post. It was not far from the front lines, but that was how Luna preferred it. If she wasn't leading her troops directly, she wasn't truly a leader. Celestia simply massaged one of her temples. Black circles ringed her eyes, and her body ached.\n\n"That... is certainly an ordeal, 'Tia," Luna breathed, her eyes tracking Celestia as the princess anxiously got to her hooves and began to pace in the tent. "When was the last time you properly slumbered?"\n\n"I slept last night."\n\n"Was it for more than an hour? I was able to attend to my dream duties last night, and I did not sense your presence in the dream realm." Luna arched a brow inquisitively as Celestia fidgeted. "Perhaps you have spent too much time—"\n\nAbruptly interrupting Luna's statement, a blaring alarm siren pierced the air, which whipped the alicorns' heads outward. Almost immediately afterward, a series of gunshots resounded and Luna sprang up from her desk. Various pictures of her with soldiers or half-finished dream catchers were knocked loose by her sudden movement. "An assault?!" she demanded aloud. "Who would be foalish enough to—"\n\nHer answer was a bullet that whizzed through the tarp, which narrowly avoided grazing Celestia's cheek. The two of them stared at each other for a beat, then Luna's horn ignited in a blue flare, before she charged out of the tent.\n\nPanting heavily, Celestia galloped out after Luna with wobbly legs. She whined when she saw a number of ponies fighting each other, although some of the ones that lost reverted in bright green flashes to their changeling form.\n\nIn the chaos of gunshots and screams, she lost track of Luna. When there was a loud explosion of magic, she quickly darted to Luna's location. She arrived to see Luna standing over three corpses, breathing heavily. However, she was oblivious to a fourth pony who was creeping up on her, knife between his teeth.\n\n"Luna!" she shrieked, just as the disguised changeling pounced. As he landed on Luna, about ready to stab, Celestia roared in fury, and a sudden ball of fire wrapped around the changeling. He batted at himself for a second before scrambling off Luna, and collapsing in a stinking pile of burnt chitin.\n\nWhen her vision cleared, she saw her work, and collapsed, her stomach giving out. She joined the changeling on the ground, the taste of bile in her mouth."
  solarreworked.51.a:0 "What have I done?!"
  solarreworked.52.t:0 "Command Confusion"
  solarreworked.52.d:0 "Barely containing the fire that was raging in her chest, Princess Luna marched through the hallways of Canterlot Castle. Her peripheral vision was tinged red, and she softly ground her teeth against each other. Every guard that was stationed along her path toward Celestia's chambers dove out of her way. None had to be mind-readers to see the veritable cloud of emotion that was visible on her face.\n\nWhen she arrived at her sister's door, she inhaled deeply and mimicked the technique that Cadance had showed her. Apparently it greatly assisted Twilight whenever she was in a tizzy. After repeating it a few times, she came to one conclusion: it was bunk. If anything, she wanted to plant the hoof she had used through Celestia's wall, and then—\n\nShe cut herself off before it turned into an internal rant. Instead, she rapped heavily on Celestia's door before she barged in. Celestia, her mane rather frizzy and unkempt, jerked up her head at Luna's entrance. She gawked silently.\n\nIn an overly sweet and caring voice, Luna smiled in a saccharine manner and inquired, "Sister, please, perchance, if you could inform Us what possible reason that THOU WOULDST AGREE TO THIS INSANITY?!" Her outburst managed to crack some of the marble around the door's entrance and under her hooves. Furiously, she held out a series of papers, authorizing, with Celestia's seal, a thinly-veiled all out assault on [BUF.GetNameDef].\n\nCelestia simply stared at it for a second, then hastily poured herself a goblet of wine and guzzled it down. She didn't reply. Rather, she started to pour over reports on her desk.\n\n"Dost thou need another reprimand?!" Luna demanded, stomping over to Celestia's desk and slamming the papers approving the "special military operation". "Verily, We didst not conceive that thou wouldst agree to thy warmonger advisors' counsel." Shooting Celestia a glare, she demanded, "Pray tell, what hast thou for thy defense?!"\n\n"Dialect, Lulu," Celestia finally grunted, although she avoided looking at her sister.\n\n"Nay, We shall speak to thee as We wish! What hast possessed thee?! Our sister would never—"\n\n"I don't know!" Celestia barked, making Luna flinch and back. "I-I just felt like... somepony else was controlling me. I—" She gulped back tears. "I don't know..."\n\nSighing, Luna brushed back her mane and stated, "We—I suppose there is one solution. It may save us some embarrassment." Quirking a brow, she inquired, "Do you not agree?""
  solarreworked.52.a:0 "Yes, I must fix this."
  solarreworked.52.b:0 "I... I can't go against previous orders."
  solarreworked.53.t:0 "Radical Reforms"
  solarreworked.53.d:0 ""Oh PLEASE, Princess, just because YOU happen to run ONE school that has not completely collapsed without the EEA's direction doesn't mean that you can suddenly dictate national policy!" Chancellor Neighsay spat, his voice echoing through the throne room of Canterlot Castle. Aside from himself and Twilight Sparkle, it was empty. Day Court had been suspended for some time, what with the war going on. From her vantage point on her throne, Celestia stared tiredly at the two of them.\n\nHer head was pounding. Racing around in her skull were thoughts of returning to more important matters, such as writing condolences for families, communicating with sympathetic countries, and directing the war effort. Yet, she would always make time for Twilight, who had requested this audience.\n\nOf course, that decision could have been a mistake.\n\nAt Neighsay's thinly veiled insinuation at her competency, Twilight snorted and ruffled her wings. "Chancellor, as much as I still respect the EEA, I am also required, as the Princess of Friendship, to point out extreme violations of basic ideals of [EQS.GetAdjective] society!" With a small cough, she materialized a large stack of papers, and started flipping through them. "For example, on page seventy-two of the current EEA guidelines, revision seven, on paragraph six, section C—"\n\n"YES, Princess, we both understand that you have read the guidelines." Neighsay gritted his teeth. Barely withholding a smile, Celestia swore that she saw a couple of grey hairs sprout on his head. "Now, do you have a point, about the rules regarding species specific entrances?"\n\n"They're completely degrading!" Twilight barked, throwing the papers away and pointing accusingly at him. "Imagine if I went to [YAL.GetNameDef] and they made me go through—"\n\n"They are safety features!" interjected Neighsay. Marching a couple of steps closer, he growled and his turquoise eyes flashed with fury. "Imagine if a yak or an adult dragon—"\n\n"Safety for whom?!"\n\n"For themselves. For other ponies!" Neighsay rolled his eyes. "Please, Princess, you must understand that they are far larger than us, and—"\n\n"Make all entrances bigger! It's not hard to make everycreature feel welcome and—"\n\n"Maybe we should just calm down?" Celestia stated meekly as she massaged her temples with her front hooves. However, both educators completely ignored her, further delving into the pros and cons of architectural decisions into account for schools.\n\nShe sighed. She should have grabbed a wine bottle, first."
  solarreworked.53.a:0 "Twilight is obviously in the right."
  solarreworked.53.b:0 "Neighsay does have a point."
  solarreworked.53.c:0 "GET OUT OF HERE, BOTH OF YOU!"
  solarreworked.54.t:0 "Meeting in Progress"
  solarreworked.54.d:0 ""And we currently have—" Raven Inkwell flipped through a few pages rapidly on her clipboard, the pages ruffling and crackling. Outside, the din of a thousand conversations of ponies walking about the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] carried in through the open windows and balcony of Celestia's private quarters. "The visit to the Acornage Memorial in fifteen minutes. You're scheduled to speak there for thirty, but if you can cut it down to twenty, we'll have plenty of time to—"\n\nCutting herself off, Raven wiped at her brow, given the rather warm weather conditions of mid-summer, and she sighed as she looked at Celestia. Celestia was restlessly wriggling one of her hindlegs and otherwise listening to the talk down below the castle. Her face was lined with stress, and she hadn't even touched her tea. Or, more impressively, her cake.\n\n"Princess?" inquired Raven as she sipped on her own glass. When Celestia didn't respond, Raven snorted. "Princess!" she repeated, her outburst managing to make Celestia jump in surprise. Raven arched a brow. "I said we have to leave for your speech, and then if we—"\n\n"I-I heard you, Raven," Celestia interjected, her voice low and huffy. Raven merely rolled her eyes. Eyeing her cake, Celestia poked at it and queried, "And what is after presenting a charity check to Countess Coloratura for the displaced fillies orphanage?" Raven could see that she bit her tongue and tensed her jaw. Although Celestia may have been able to hide things from nobles who saw her infrequently, there wasn't a detail that her secretary could miss. Especially when it meant more paperwork.\n\n"What is it?" she asked. She stowed the pencil she had into the nook of her clipboard.\n\nAs Raven adjusted her glasses, Celestia mulled a response. Poking her tongue against her cheek, she finally stuttered, "I-I am merely seeing all those—" She shuddered "—All the ponies I'll have to apologize to. That funeral—"\n\n"It was one soldier. You—"\n\n"No! It was a PONY! One of MY ponies!" Jumping to her hooves, Celestia paced to and fro, and Raven started to automatically stroke off planned events with a sigh. Celestia snarled, "She should have never been on the front lines! My ponies are not safe when—"\n\n"Princess, if I may, I've taken the liberty to cancel all your appearances today, and I will order a second cake from Sugar Cube Corner." Getting up, Raven added as she reached the door. "I'll make a statement that you are indisposed because of an emergency war council session."\n\nTaking a deep breath, Celestia relaxed slightly and muttered, "Thank you, Raven.""
  solarreworked.54.a:0 "However, I must keep up appearances."
  solarreworked.54.b:0 "You know me too well."
  solarreworked.70.t:0 "Visit from the Setting Sun"
  solarreworked.70.d:0 "When the battlecruiser HMS Golden Dawn and its entourage of screening ships arrived in the harbor of Sunset, the mood was instantly soured, although it was not because of a lack of fanfare. In a matter of fifteen minutes, Jet Set was alerted to the arrival of somepony from [EQS.GetNameDef] and hurried to the pier. His heartreat skyrocketed when he saw a few of his soldiers already there in parade formation.\n\nFor the last couple of minutes, he stood patiently, feeling the sea breeze blowing through his mane and spraying droplets of saltwater onto his glasses. However, he didn't touch them. Not when the unannounced visitor could emerge any moment. He swallowed nervously.\n\nJust as he was about to give into the irritation, there was clanking of gangplanks, and soon one was lowered from the side of the battlecruiser. He stiffened at the sight of a uniformed mare, flanked on either side by guards. For a brief second, she surveyed the pier, then stalked down the gangplank. She disembarked and marched directly in his direction.\n\n"Governor General Jet Set, how kind of you to finally greet me," she spat as she reached him. In an instant, her piercing blue eyes had completely sized him up. Somehow, he could sense that she saw right through him. If there was one thing he noticed about her, was that she was YOUNG. Why would [EQS.GetLeader] send somepony who was so green?\n\nAfter gathering his voice, he merely responded with, "[EQS.Leader] didn't inform me that I should be expecting an—" He coughed "—an honored guest." At that, she lightly tittered.\n\n"How quaint," she retorted with a snort. Momentarily a snarky twinkle appeared in her eyes, and she brushed back her braided mane behind her topcoat. "Why would she announce that you should expect her official representative? You could easily hide damning details."\n\nJet's breath hitched. "I assure you, there is nothing that—"\n\nWaving a hoof dismissively, she strode past him. "Save your platitudes! I'm not an idiot. We shall see if there is a reason to trust your word." She paused. Turning back, she added, "But do be sure that it's a challenge. Certainly more than that pin of the old regime." She nodded at a symbol of the two sisters on his chest. "It's far from subtle regarding where your loyalties lie.""

  solarreworked.100.t:0 "Personal Reminders"
  solarreworked.100.d:0 ""I-It's an, um, pleasure, to host you, Y-Your Majesty," Posey Shy meekly stated as she brought out a pot of tea from the kitchen of she and her husband's humble abode. Cracking an awkward smile, she placed the pot on the small table in their living room. When Daybreaker arched a brow, Posey adjusted her glasses and tittered uneasily. She poured a cup and passed it to Daybreaker, who merely gazed at it for a second before sipping on it.\n\n"Not to be rude, Your Grace, b-but why did you say you came again?" Posey's husband, Gentle Breeze, inquired with a quivering voice. He nervously switched his attention between the two guards that were standing at rapt attention at the entrance to the living room.\n\nAfter taking another drink of her tea, Daybreaker merely looked at him for a moment, then quipped, "Does your Empress require a reason to impose upon her subjects?"\n\n"No! Not at all! I'm merely confused why it would be US?" Gentle glanced between him and his wife. Although it was faint, there was a spark of worry in his eyes, beyond just being in the presence of his better.\n\nBefore Daybreaker could respond, the front door of the Shy's slammed and a carefree, young voice exclaimed, "Yo, Mom! Pops! I'm back from an aching long day. Won't ya come out here and help grab my stuff?" Seconds later, an aquamarine pegasus trotted into the room and gasped. "You're hosting a '"Welcome back, Zephyr" party?!' You shouldn't have!" He shot one glance at Daybreaker. "Heya, Hot Stuff."\n\nBraying indignantly, Daybreaker nodded her head and both guards darted to seize Zephyr. He let out a whinny of surprise, but stated, "You know, if you really like me that much—"\n\n"Silence, foal!" Daybreaker hissed. Bending down to stare him in the eyes, she growled, "As one of the Element Bearers' siblings, ponies look to you, whether you realize it or not."\n\nDaybreaker unfurled a letter. "Normally, draft dodging is below me, but in this case, I'll make an exception."\n\n"N-Now, I'm sure there's an explanation for—" Posey began before Daybreaker glared directly into her soul. She squeaked and went mute.\n\nSquinting, Zephyr inspected the letter while making a low hum. He shrugged, "Sorry, Hot Stuff. Not interested. All that blood and guts would ruin my resplendent mane job."\n\nWith a low growl, Daybreaker bared her teeth and yanked him forward by the muzzle with her magic. Her eyes narrowed. "I wasn't asking, foal!""
  solarreworked.100.a:0 "Nopony defies me!"
  solarreworked.101.t:0 "No Vacation"
  solarreworked.101.d:0 ""Can't believe the nerve of her," Zephyr Breeze grumbled softly as he settled into a nook between a couple of trees. Twelve weeks of basic, just to be thrown a gun and then left out to rot on some smelly battlefield. Did they know how many grains of dirt he'd found underneath his hooves?! More than one! Couldn't even take a Celestia-foresaken nap around his sergeant without getting screamed at.\n\nThankfully no blood had gotten on him yet, but if he had to fight a bug or something with his bayonet, then all that ichor would stain him for months.\n\nSuddenly, a bullet whizzed by his head and broke his reverie. A second later, a couple of screams carried toward him, and he yawned as he tried to drown things out. Apparently there was some battle going on right now, but who cared? He needed to catch up on some zs, and his CO wasn't paying attention right now.\n\nHowever, between the noise of combat and the deep-seated anger he felt from that admittedly looker of an alicorn who hauled him off to boot camp, he could barely get any rest. Cracking an eye open, he grunted when it grew quiet, and he huffed before getting up and checking on the command post, which was nearby. Perhaps one of the nerds there could tell him of a nice hiding spot to snooze away the day.\n\nAfter weaving through a few corridors, which had klaxon sirens blaring, he spotted the quarters of the regiment's general, Cuff Link, and poked his head in. "Heya, General?" he asked, an idea coming to his mind. Nopony was there.\n\nGrinning from ear to ear, he slunk in and poked around in the wardrobe. Sure enough, there was a spare uniform, like he hoped there would be. After quickly donning, he turned around, and screamed when a soldier rushed into the room. However, the soldier saluted, and exclaimed, "General! You were reported killed in battle. What are you doing here?!"\n\nZephyr's mind raced. Sweat trickled down his neck. Stuttering, he fibbed, "W-Well, that's obviously because somepony who LOOKED like me was killed. I was here the entire time. Definitely." He cracked an uneasy smile.\n\nPanic etched into his face, the soldier grabbed him without questioning the lie. "Part of the line has been broken! We need you to direct its regrouping!" Before Zephyr could protest, he was grabbed by a hoof, and pulled toward the communications room. Zephyr could only sigh."
  solarreworked.101.a:0 "This is my life, apparently."
  solarreworked.102.t:0 "A Good Jig"
  solarreworked.102.d:0 "Kicking back in his office chair and sighing, Zephyr Breeze slipped his both his forelegs behind his head pressed as far as he could into the plush leather. In only a few weeks, he had completely transformed that stuffy, old room that the geezer before him had used into a hip and fun place. A few pictures—of himself, of course—an icebox with a selection of various ciders, and a pool table. Could still use a few more amenities, but it was a start.\n\nOutside his office, he could hear ponies rushing to and fro, and one mare quickly poked her head in to inquire, "Have you finished, General?"\n\n"Hm?" Zephyr cracked an eyelid open. "Oh, yeah, yeah!" Swiping a single page from his desk, which he spent all of maybe two seconds reading, he tossed it toward her. From the title, he thought it might have been something about fireworks, or the like.Something with some big booms. Maybe they were all using those giant guns a couple miles away for a show later.\n\n"What about the inventory reports on our current medical supplies?" the aide asked as she took the page in her magic.\n\n"Oh, uh, I gave that to Corporal, uh, Smudge or something," Zephyr mumbled as he started to slip back into sleep. Yawning, he muttered, "You know, delegation is key to success!" He spread his wings to stretch them, then waved her off. "You can go now. I'm just going to, uh, think on some new battle plans. Yeah!"\n\nDutifully, the mare left and his door clicked shut. For a few minutes, the hustle and bustle continued outside, but it soon grew disturbingly quiet as a few sets of hooves stomped toward his office. As the door slammed open, he sighed, "Yo, what'd I tell you about—"\n\nAs his vision cleared, he froze when he saw a unicorn with the exact same fur and mane color as him glowering at him, while standing between two guards, who were also looking outraged. The double, who was probably about fifteen years older, was missing part of an ear, and had a large gauze patch over half his face and neck. He wore a general's uniform.\n\nZephyr gulped. "Ah, General Link! I-I heard that you were KIA. But, uh, I see I was wrong." As the general's glower deepened, Zephyr spied the window in the office, and tensed. "I'd love to chat, but, uh, I kept your seat warm, and uh, I think I'll be going!" Leaping for the window, he punched through the glass, and was soon nothing more than a distant speck on the horizon."

With her station set along one of the few small settlements of [CRY.GetNameDef], she had a relatively quiet position. In the past, there had been an odd incident or two of an accused changeling infiltrator, before it was determined that it was just a unicorn with a mild allergy to magic. There was even a bugbear once, but it was being directed by Fluttershy to a safe nesting location, so it wasn't much of a threat.\n\nTherefore, when she caught some movement in the sky on her way back to her station for the evening, she frowned. Readying her rifle, she took aim and traced it as it grew larger. Soon enough, she could see it was a lanky pegasus. Since she was concealed by some of the shrubs in the wooded area near the town, she could watch him as he approached.\n\nHe seemed to be fleeing. Every so often, he'd glance over his shoulders like he was being pursued, but he wasn't being followed, from what she could see. When he was about three hundred feet out and above her, she stepped and called, "Halt! You're entering [CRY.GetAdjective] territory!" He screamed with a haggard gasp and noticed her. She held her gun at the ready.\n\nFreezing and looking at her gun, he obeyed and descended. When his hooves touched the earth, he collapsed and began to kiss it. "Thank Celestia!" he exclaimed when he stopped. "Finally somepony to help me!" Before Refraction could ask him anything, he grabbed both her shoulders and shook her. "They're after me! I-I barely made it out! I know they're hunting little ol' me!"\n\nShe pushed him back. Arching a brow, she demanded, "Who's hunting you?" Now that she was closer, she could tell he was wearing a rather sweat-drenched uniform of an [EQS.GetAdjective] officer. "Wait," she began. "Are you an [EQS.GetAdjective] soldier?" She tightened her grip on her rifle.\n\nFor a second, he blinked at her, and then he bobbed his head up and down frantically. "Y-Yeah, totally! Five star gen-er-RAL!" He fluttered his lashes at her innocently. "They were cramping my style, so I said, 'No thanks, buckos!' and then they just started chasing me!" He hopped up. "Super important pony, after all." He shot her a smug grin. "Probably sent a whole army after me."\n\n"Right..." she muttered. "Well, it'll have to be verified, but if you're an [EQS.GetAdjective] general..." Pausing for a second, she finally quipped, "I think we have a job for you.""

  solarreworked.104.d:0 "Trillium Petal briefly sighed as she flipped through a few papers on her clipboard. Reaching vainly to her coffee cup, she groaned and hung her head before she put down the clipboard, then leaned over to grab it. She swiped at air, which made her look back up to blink in surprise. Then she heard a loud, long slurp as the other pony—correction, one of the other ponies—guzzled HER coffee. She snarled.\n\nWhen his eyes locked with hers, he stopped mid-slurp and just looked at her. He wiggled his eyebrows playfully.\n\n"Private, is there a reason you're still in here with your—" Petal eyed him again "—your general?"\n\n"Don't worry about her, Glitter Glow—"\n\n"That isn't even close to my name."\n\n"Whatever." The stallion waved a hoof dismissively. To her consternation and rapidly skyrocketing migraine, he leaned back on his chair and kicked his hind hooves up on the table. The interrogation table. Not that he really seemed to treat the offices of [CRY.GetAgency]'s with much respect. Or really the offices of anything in [CRY.GetNameDef] that well, from what she saw on her clipboard.\n\nIf it weren't because he was, from what they could verify, a general in [EQS.GetNameDef]'s military, he would have probably been looking at a dishonorable discharge, at best.\n\nWith a long, exasperated sigh, she rubbed her temples for a second or two, then looked at her clipboard. She had to double check his name. Zephyr Sneeze. Straightening her papers, she asked him, "General, if we may begin?"\n\n"Hmm?" he inquired, as he was looking at one of the rank stripes on his [CRY.GetAdjective] uniform. "Oh, sure, shiny stuff. But you didn't need to take me here to—"\n\n"Stuff it," she huffed, then flipped through a couple more pages. "All right, so, now that we finally have the bandwidth, what can you tell us about some of [EQS.GetLeader]'s battle plans? Troop compositions? Research projects?" With each question, Zephyr's posture grew more discomforted and he started to wriggle uneasily. "Anything? You said you were a 'top-top-brass.'" She furrowed her brow. "So?"\n\n"Uh, well, you know, when I said that I meant, actually, uh—" Zephyr pulled on his collar, then spotted one of small windows in the room. "I meant I was FRIENDS with one, and uh—" Before he finished, he bolted from his seat and dove straight for the window. Crashing through the glass, he took to the skies and was a blip on the horizon in no time at all."

  solarreworked.105.t:0 "A New Comrade"
  solarreworked.105.d:0 ""And you picked him up where?" Commissar Kirov inquired one of his underlings as he stalked through the corridors of the small outpost between [STG.GetNameDef] and [CRY.GetNameDef]. As they passed a small portrait of Steel Stallion, they both saluted before continuing on.\n\nThe private was uncomfortably waffling between a few different ways to start. Between all the uhs, ahs, ums, and wells, he did get out that they picked up the [CRY.GetAdjective] officer up right on the border. Apparently, he was staggering around, and claimed he hadn't had a drink of water in seven weeks, which was simply absurd. Also, when he had seen it was a [STG.GetAdjective] patrol, he then started saying all he needed was vodka. And also began speaking in a thick, stereotypical, [STG.GetAdjective] accent.\n\n"Right," Kirov grunted as he dismissed the peon. By now, they had gotten to the outpost's one interrogation room, and he began to observe the prisoner from behind the one-way mirror. Certainly, he appeared to be a [CRY.GetAdjective] officer, given the rather ragged uniform which he was wearing. Still, he was an Equestrian, given the complete lack of crystal shine. Those were rare.\n\nScratching his chin, Kirov huffed and brushed back some of his dark blue mane before entering. As soon as the officer heard him enter, the stallion ran to him and begged, "Please! I need some hoof trimmers. Poor ol' me hasn't have a good hooficure in AGES!" He coughed. Suddenly in a thick, movie-like accent, he also inquired, "Uh, and comrade, get me an entire bottle of wodka. Da?"\n\nKirov glowered at him.\n\nCoughing into a hoof, the stallion tittered, "W-Well, ah, I thought that'd go better in my head."\n\nIn perfect Equestrian, with little inflection, Kirov grunted, "I speak your language fine, capitalist lackey. Do not insult my intelligence."\n\n"O-Oh, buddy, I'm not ANYPONY'S lackey," he stated while wrapping a hoof around Kirov's neck. "You know, I always said, 'Zephyr uh... Cheese, don't let nopony cramp yer style,' and I am one free soul!" He smiled widely at Kirov and added, "Totally thought outside the box and just—" He whistled and whipped his hoof up high. "Shot straight to the top."\n\n"Right..."\n\n"And can I like, stay here for a while?" With an innocent grin, he rapidly fluttered his eyelids. "Please?! I may be chased by uh, you know, them."\n\n"Oh, so a traitor, hmm?" Kirov muttered as he rubbed his chin thoughtfully. Clearing his throat, he snapped and pushed Zephyr off him. "I will speak to my superiors. They have use for you after all." He sneered. "I'd suggest you accept it. It beats being shot."\n\nZephyr gulped."

  solarreworked.113.d:0 "Exhaling contentedly, Zephyr Breeze strained his wings as far as they could reach to work out the kinks that had slowly wormed their way into them over the last several hours. Slowly, the light cloud that he had brought down to his humble lean-to fluttered in a light, warm wind. For the first time in he didn't know how long, he was finally at peace.\n\nSure, his parents probably thought he was dead. Fluttershy was worried sick about him, and Rainbow Dash was probably beside herself in hysterics about the thought of never seeing him again, but he was at least safe. No more risk of ruining his perfectly maintained hooves with blood. No more fraying clothes making him feel icky—although he did have a nice collection of medals from his adventures—and no more being bossed around.\n\nHe was the boss of his own life now!\n\nIf he had to reflect on the last few years, it'd be one of contentment. And theft, but he didn't need to think about that. It was more like "permanent borrowing" of food, anyway. It meant he could lounge around thinking and soaking up the sun, since staying so far outside of any civilization meant that the risk of being found by... HER were slim to none.\n\nAs he briefly envisioned that fiery alicorn, he shivered. Sure, she was hot—literally—but being taken back to that army again? No thanks.\n\nScreaming, he leapt out of his cloud as his reverie was shattered by an earth-shaking explosion. In the distance, a shower of dust and smoke filled the air, and more soon followed. Within short order, some soldiers of [BAT.GetNameDef] took to the air. Soon, even more started fleeing in the opposite direction of the blasts.\n\nHowever, as he was about to lie back down, a chill zipped down his spine as he saw few new soldiers march forwrad. It was [EQS.GetNameDef]! He could recognize those white uniforms anywhere.\n\nQuivering, he froze on the spot, then gasped. In a burst of blood-red magic, a tall, imposing figure appeared in front of some troops. Her armor glinted in the sunlight, and her fiery mane raged against the backdrop of the earth. Daybreaker was here! She was looking right at him!\n\nShe'd come for him!\n\nYears of repressed fear seizing him in an instant, Zephyr shrieked and peeled off into the sky. At his speed and distance, he failed to notice Daybreaker's confused frown as he disappeared from view, forever running from the pony who would have him fight."

  solarreworked.120.d:0 "Stalking through the radiant halls of the Kaiserschloss of Griffenheim, Daybreaker could barely withhold a self-satisfied smirk from breaking across her muzzle. It was a sweet irony, to see [GRD.GetNameDef] rise by the point of a sword, only for it to come crumbling down from years of decay, undermining, and politics. Even its resurgence, which she had to admit, wasn't entirely expected, was clearly a last gasp by a dying creature.\n\nAs if to emphasize her thoughts, she saw a grand, sprawling mural of Grover II, depicting his various campaigns across the continent. Conveniently, it ignored the fact that it was a pony who ended the fool. She merely held back a chuckle at it. If Grover II was alive, he would have been appalled at the resplendent lives of his descendants. True, he led life as a noble, but he had been a warrior at heart.\n\nWith her entertainment quota fulfilled, she marched toward her objective: the doors to the young Grover's chambers. She nodded to her two guards that were stationed on either side of them, and she entered. Already, her magic was readied for a surprise attack, but none came. Instead, Grover merely sat by his window. When she entered, he closed his book he was reading and readjusted his glasses.\n\n"What do you want?" he demanded rather testily in a faint Griffenheim accent. A few molting feathers fell off his adolescent face. "You have already bested us. Do you wish to kill me?" He straightened and puffed out his chest, but she could see him quiver faintly in fear. "You won't find me groveling for mercy."\n\nBearing her fangs and chortling, Daybreaker shook her head and clucked, "No, no, my little... griffon. You misunderstand my intentions."\n\n"Really? I have read the reports on what has happened in Equestria," Grover responded with a huff. Daybreaker suppressed a snarl at the mention of her nation's old name.\n\n"What's happened in MY EMPIRE is none of your concern." Trotting closer to him and letting her mane flap about and bathe his chambers in an orange glow, she stated, "But you shall learn in time that my decisions were only for my ponies' protection." As he flared his wings defensively, she sneered and added, "You shall learn much from me."\n\n"Where is [GetGriffonRegent]?!" he demanded. "If [GRD.GetLeader.GetSheHe] has been harmed, I'll—"\n\n"[GRI.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] is... indisposed, little griff," Daybreaker chortled. Batting away a single swipe of his claws as she reached out, she placed a forehoof on his head as a parent would pat their foal and stated, "Don't worry. You'll soon come to think of me as an aunt. I will be all the family you need.""

  solarreworked.121.d:0 "The Sun rose high upon the ancient city of Griffonstone. Amidst the cobbled streets and winding alleyways of the homeland of the griffons, a varied procession of ponies and griffons marched toward the ceremonial coronation hall, formerly the kingly palace of Grover I, and later, of his blood relatives, the Gutos, which reached up to the heavens above the other, destitute buildings of the old metropolis, cutting like a gleaming knife through hot butter.\n\nAlthough the procession itself was a rather proud affair, none of the griffons that had been assembled to spectate made noise. Interspersed throughout, easily noticeable by the wake they created, armed pony soldiers, dressed in brilliant white parade uniform, watched for signs of dissent.\n\nIn the middle of the procession, Daybreaker slowly, haughtily, cantered. For once, instead of wearing her armor, she was adorned in a shimmering golden gown, which trailed behind her and was kept clean through various enchantments. Casting her gaze around her observers, she only sneered in amused contempt at their searing glares. Whatever they thought mattered not, for soon they would be able to question her even less than they already could.\n\nIn only a couple of minutes, the parade had finally reached the entrance to the coronation hall, the pillars of which glistened in the noonday sun. Briefly, Daybreaker remained stationary at the steps of the hall, looking back at the statue of Grover I that they had passed. Its chipped and eroded made her chuckle. Such a fitting picture of an aging empire.\n\nInside the hall, the domed roof permitted the full display of the Sun's beauty to come through. Ahead of the ceremony, perfectly clear crystal chalices, chandeliers, and every other item that could be conceived were set up for the noble guests. She barely registered it, though, as she suppressed a cackle when she saw Grover VI and his regent, [GRD.GetLeader], along with one of the Griffonstone nobles, waiting for her on the dais.\n\nSauntering her way toward the dais after waiting for the choir of griffons to be convinced to pronounce her entrance, she nodded once to the noble, and merely shot Grover a self-assured smirk. Surprisingly, the young griff remained restrained, and kept his face from displaying any emotion. However, she could see in his eyes that he was fighting between furious, combative, and resigned.\n\nIt didn't take long for her goal to be retrieved. The glimmering crown of the Grovers soon was escorted toward the dais, and she bore her teeth in delight. With a single sigh, she took it, placed it upon her head, and waited.\n\nThe only applause she received was dead silence."

  solarreworked.122.d:0 ""I am not going to repeat myself again, griff," Daybreaker huffed as she sat across the other side of the dining table in one of the private rooms of the Kaiserschloss. "I will force feed you if it comes to it." Grover didn't bother replying, though, as he continued to just listlessly fiddle with one of the pieces of food on his plate.\n\n"And if I refuse?" he muttered in response, giving Daybreaker a side-eye and munching on one of the pieces of liver that was displayed on the plate. "You'll finally kill me, like I thought all along?"\n\nDaybreaker rolled her eyes. Finishing her salad, she huffed, "Preposterous! I would have no reason!"\n\n"Other than being a bloodthirsty murderer?" retorted Grover, which earned a raised eyebrow from her. "Do not intend to lie to me about what goes on in Equestria. Your toadies that you leave in your place while you're away blab even when I'm around." He snorted. "They must believe I'm still a chick."\n\n"Bold of you to tell me you spy on conversations that don't concern you," Daybreaker snarled, her mane momentarily flaring a slightly hotter yellow. However, Grover didn't flinch, and the additional light and heat from her soon dissipated. Pushing aside a couple of scrolls which she had been reading in between spurts of conversation, she stated, "But I'm feeling benevolent today."\n\n"How exciting." Grover returned to reading his book, his plate mostly uneaten.\n\nGritting her teeth, Daybreaker grunted, "If you are so curious regarding the state of my empire, then you will begin your education now."\n\n"You do realize that I've been receiving tutelage for over a decade now, no? My education—"\n\n"Is not sufficient," she cut in as she waltzed toward him. In her magic, she brought both her scrollsdropped them into his lap. "Read them. Give me your ruling," she ordered, her tone harsh and commanding.\n\nMomentarily, he stared at her, the faintest hint of fear revealing itself in his raised hackles. He scanned the scrolls. From what he could tell, they were two reports of captured prisoners, one from [EQS.GetNameDef], one from [GRD.GetNameDef].\n\n"The value stolen isn't much. I would... probably give them a small sentence and then release them," he stated. As there was a burst of flame from the liver on his plate, he jumped in shock.\n\n"Incorrect. They will both steal again. The pony has been captured on thirteen charges, the griffon has been in your jails three times." With a smarmy grin, she inquired, "It appears you need a better education after all, don't you think?""

  solarreworked.124.d:0 "Golden sunlight poured through the perfectly clear, crystal windows of the throne room within the Kaiserschloss, bouncing off the marble pillars and imparting a regal hue to any and all those that stood within. Stationed at the entrance to the throne room, as well as on either side of the dais up to the throne, [EQS.GetAdjective] soldiers stood rigidly at attention, potentially more than usual, given that they were within the presence of their Empress.\n\nIn Grover's mind, he couldn't imagine the last time they were this on edge. Even other times that Daybreaker had visited for her duties as regent, she didn't instill as much fear as he saw in them now. As he adjusted his glasses, he studied one of the soldiers closely, noting many of the hidden emotions that were forcing their way out. Subtle cues: tightened jaw, slight working of the teeth, a small fidget in the left hind leg. All indicated that, not only was this pony fearful, he was furious. Most likely upset at being stationed here, not that he'd admit it near his Empress.\n\nAs his mind wandered, he was broken from his observation as Daybreaker cast a small field of magic on some of his hackles, and he growled testily. She straightened them out and grunted, "Silence. I do not wish to be here any more than you do, griff."\n\n"And you did not need to attend, pony," he grumbled in return as she fixed a slight crease in his uniform. When she finished, he huffed and brushed off the topcoat which he wore, which clinked with a few medals that he'd yet to actually earn. Meanwhile, she was gowned in a fire orange dress, and eschewed her normal regalia. In front of them both, a trembling griffon who was hurriedly setting up various mirrors near a camera to reflect the light darted glanced at them occasionally.\n\nDaybreaker scoffed at his statement. "I am your regent. I believe I deserve to be acknowledged."\n\n"I am old enough to—"\n\n"Enough babbling," she interrupted with a hiss, which only earned a glare from him. "This matter is settled. The Empire must see its rulers."\n\n"Or its ruler and her puppet," he quipped back as the photographer motioned for them to stand back. When they were lined up with the throne to create a background with it between them, the griffon made them stop, and Grover furrowed his brow.\n\n"Smile, griff," Daybreaker hissed, just as they were both blinded by the flash of the camera.\n\nHe didn't comply."

Every single one of her targets, various prisoners from rebel camps that had yet to be properly dealt with, fell to her advances. Despite her lithe form, which belied some of her innate, alicorn strength, she dove at one of the nearby, fleeing ponies, who was banging on the door out of the training room.\n\nAs a chime of magic echoed through the arena, there was an agonizing screech, and then it went silent. Slowly, the lights to the room dimmed, and there was a single, light click as the latch to the door was released, by a simple twist by Daybreaker's magic.\n\nIn a burst of light, Daybreaker teleported to the other side of the door, and opened it, revealing Flurry, who was heaving over the charred body of the rebel. She continued to stare at it for a moment, emotions running rampant in her eyes, switching rapidly between rage, confusion, anger, hurt, fear, and shock. While her breaths continued in staccato bursts, she finally got off of the body and staggered on wobbly legs toward Daybreaker.\n\n"You succeeded," Daybreaker stated matter-of-factly. Masking a fake yawn by placing a hoof over her muzzle, she concealed a grin as Flurry collapsed in a heap in front of her.\n\n"I—I—I—" she stammered a few times.\n\n"You succeeded," repeated Daybreaker, stepping forward and resting a hoof on Flurry's shoulder. The young mare looked at Daybreaker, tears welling up as she gazed into her aunt's eyes. "You did not hesitate. You took charge. Like an alicorn must." At Flurry's nod, she smiled. "Tell me: what did you feel?"\n\n"I... felt... furious. Everypony there was a danger to [EQS.GetNameDef]. A danger to you! To me!" At that, Flurry pushed herself back up. "I-If they could coordinate, they could have attacked you!" Realization clearly dawning on her, the dam of emotions broke and she sobbed, "I can't let them hurt you! I can't let them hurt me!" Only a couple of sniffs escaped her nose before she screamed, "I'll break them all!"\n\nAs Flurry wailed, Daybreaker smirked.\n\nShe had finally learned."

Trying to escape with magic was useless, as this had clearly been created to hold powerful mages. Although faint, the memory of Celestia stating as much, and about how they were almost never used, returned to her mind. As soon as it did, her throat caught and she choked back a couple of sniffs.\n\nIt didn't also help that her horn had been locked down with an inhibitor ring.\n\nShe flicked her ear when a scratching on the door's lock caught her attention. On the other side of the bars, two guards, dressed in full parade uniform, stood on either side, while a third unlatched the door. Seconds later, he stepped away, and Sunset's throat latched itself shut.\n\nEntering the room with a confident sashay, Daybreaker performed a cursory inspection of the cell, and then looked to Sunset. "Hello, my long lost—"\n\n"No!" Sunset interjected, shaking her head and crawling back a few paces. "Don't even say that! You aren't Celestia! Don't even try!"\n\nA pained frown fell upon Daybreaker's muzzle, and she shook her head. "My dearest Sunset, I'm just as much her as she is me." Stepping forward, she reached out a forehoof to cup one of Sunset's cheeks, although it was quickly batted away as Sunset retreated further into the cell. Daybreaker didn't pursue. Rather, she arched an eyebrow. "Tell me, why did you not return earlier to help me?"\n\n"I didn't come to help you!" Sunset barked back. Although she managed to keep a straight face, her chest burned with emotion, and she blinked back tears. "I came to help Equestria! To help Twilight!"\n\n"Oh, yes, Twilight." Daybreaker grinned. "But not for me? If so, then why did it take a war to bring you? If you cared more for my Empire and for Twilight, what was preventing you from volunteering for their sake sooner?"\n\n"I—"\n\n"I think that it is more than that, and we're going to spend a bit of time determining what." Again, Daybreaker stepped forward, her radiant mane illuminating the entire cell as she did so. When she was only a few feet away, Sunset attempted to dart past her, but Daybreaker merely grabbed her in a telekinetic field.

Cracking a smirk, she added, "I recall when you attempted to break into one of the—"\n\n"Shut up!" Sunset bellowed as she flattened her ears against her skull and spun away from Daybreaker. "Those aren't your memories! Y-You're just trying to get into my head!" Despite her emphatic declaration, a couple of tears managed to trickle down her muzzle. "There's nothing you can say that will make me believe you!"\n\n"Then how about this?" Daybreaker inquired. She stepped back. As if reflecting a calmer state of mind, her mane's steady, rhythmic waving in an ethereal wind slowed, and the bright orange flame darkened to a blood red. Placing a hoof to her peytral, Daybreaker stated, "I forgive you."\n\nSunset jerked her head around. Although she didn't say anything, Daybreaker could see some of the fire leave her eyes. In return, a spark of curiosity was quickly extinguished by a renewed anger, and Sunset crossed her forehooves and looked away again.\n\n"You heard correctly, Sunset Shimmer, my former student." Since Sunset didn't cut her off, Daybreaker bared her fangs in a sneer and stated, "Just like I forgive all those who truly repent of their rebellion against me."\n\n"Yes, because THAT'S happened so far."\n\n"Do you think me a monster, Sunset?" Daybreaker glanced over her shoulder as she trotted to the one, small window looking out of the cell into the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. "Am I so different from you? From everything Twilight told me, did you not decide you knew what was best for those creatures on the other side of the portal? Did you listen to their needs? Did you understand their wants?"\n\nSunset's expression darkened. "What I did was wrong! I controlled them! Forced them to do my bidding!"\n\n"Ah, but some followed you willingly, did they not? Is that no different from what I must do? Ponies do not always know what is best for them, yet they can be convinced to follow those who do. If you were to go free, would you fight against every one that believes in me? How many would you have to kill to declare that 'evil' has been defeated?"\n\nDaybreaker turned and leaned toward Sunset. "How many until you felt accepted?""

As Daybreaker effectively leered over Sunset, Sunset's posture slumped, and she started to work her jaw nervously. Instead of defiance or anger, her ears were pressed against her head in despair. Steady tears trickled down her muzzle and stained the simple sheets of the cot.\n\nSitting down to be at eye level with Sunset, Daybreaker gently reached underneath Sunset's chin and pulled it up. Sunset's eyes met with hers momentarily, then Sunset jerked away again. Still, the unicorn was clearly fighting back sobs, and she pulled her forelegs close to her chest before scooting back on the bed.\n\n"No answer?" prodded Daybreaker. Closing her eyes, she sighed, "If you were to defeat me? Where would that lead you? Would ponies accept you? Would they see that you did what you did for 'their good'? Would you not simply be imposing your will on them, like you did with the creatures beyond the portal?"\n\n"No... I... would do it out of... love for them." Sunset wiped at her nose.\n\n"And you think I do not love them?" For a second time, the cocky grin that was on Daybreaker's muzzle broke and she solemnly gazed at Sunset. "Do you not think I do this all for them? Am I not the one who is protecting them? From Chrysalis, or [STG.GetLeader], [WNG.GetLeader], Sombra, Tirek, or others? From themselves?"\n\n"I..."\n\nDaybreaker stretched out a hoof. As her reach was far longer, she was able to pull Sunset toward her, and soon pressed her into a tight embrace. Wrapping her wings around Sunset, she stated, "Sunset, my Sunset, you do not have to keep fighting. You do not have to keep seeking approval, whether from Twilight, Equestria, or anypony else. You have a home here.\n\n"You can choose to protect Harmony, like I do for my ponies. You can be accepted for who you are. You don't have to keep wandering, thinking only of your guilt." Daybreaker gently ran a forehoof up and down Sunset's back. "Did you not express how you wished the family you never had back in Tall Tale? You can have that here. You can have all of that, if you help me shield Equestria and Harmony from danger."\n\nSuddenly, whatever was holding Sunset back shattered, and she began sobbing into Daybreaker's fur. As the broken mare's tears soaked Daybreaker's skin, Daybreaker's muzzle twisted into a self-satisfied grin."
  solarreworked.207.a:0 "You have come home, Sunset Shimmer."
  solarreworked.208.t:0 "Arise"
  solarreworked.208.d:0 ""I—" Sunset Shimmer began, before her words choked on her tears and she buried her head further into Daybreaker's chest. Gripping one limply onto Daybreaker's other foreleg, she attempted to force back a few coughs and sputters, while Daybreaker continued to shush her while rubbing her back. "I just want... everypony to be safe."\n\n"As do I, Sunset, yet what you thought was the right way would only lead them into more danger. Do you not see that now?" Daybreaker inquired, momentarily leaving the warm hug and wiping away a couple of Sunset's tears. "Do you not see that ponies like us must guide them to safe pastures, whether they agree with it or not?"\n\nWith Sunset's silence, barring the uneasy working of her jaw, Daybreaker clicked her tongue like a chiding, concerned mother, and pulled Sunset back into the embrace. "You do not have to fight any longer. Your journey has come to an end. You're home. Truly home."\n\n"B-But what you want... it isn't me... it's my past. My past isn't my today. I—" Sunset coughed and choked again, before a few hiccups racked her body. With a comforting "shhh," Daybreaker began to softly play her wings along Sunset's back and head. Slowly, the sobs came to a stop, and Sunset stammered, "W-What can be done?"\n\n"You will assist me. You will help everypony who aids me."\n\nLeaving the embrace, Daybreaker stood and patiently left a forehoof out for Sunset to take. Sunset eyed it sullenly, then reached for it. She paused for a second. One last, weak flame of resistance flashed in her eyes, then she sighed. In defeat, she wrapped one of her own forehooves around Daybreaker, and wobbingly stood up.\n\n"I don't know what—"\n\n"Don't say anything, Sunset. You will make me proud." Daybreaker clamped a wing on Sunset's shoulder. "But from henceforth, you are a new pony. Together, Dawnbreak Shimmer, you and I shall preserve Harmony." She squeezed tighter on Sunset's shoulder. "You are home.""
  solarreworked.208.a:0 "Welcome back, my prodigal daughter."
  solarreworked.209.d:0 ""I... I... No!" Twilight screamed as she slammed the marble floor of the throne room repeatedly with her hoof. Each successive impact slowly weakened, and she whimpered more loudly in tandem. "I wouldn't! I would never! I would be helping them! F-Freeing them! From—" Twilight cut herself off in a couple of sniffs. From where Daybreaker stood, now again impassive and observing her former student, she could see tears glistening in the light streaming in through the stained glass windows.\n\n"But you would," Daybreaker emphasized, keeping her voice calm and collected as she sauntered ever nearer to Twilight. What little bit of fire that had reignited itself within Twilight was quickly flickering and perishing. It would only take a little push to snuff it out permanently.\n\nNow only a couple of inches away from her, Daybreaker simply stated, "Twilight."\n\nFor a moment, Twilight didn't look up, but when she did, her eyes were bloodshot, and she blinked a few times as Daybreaker's mane reflected in her pupils. Dark tracts had been carved into her fur where her tears had stained them. With every passing second, fear, pain, and confusion grew more evident upon the young alicorn's face.\n\nDaybreaker shook her, like a doting mother. "Twilight, Twilight, Twilight. My faithful student." She reassuringly placed a hoof upon Twilight's head, and Twilight flinched. However, with her chains keeping her in place, she could only whine a couple of times while Daybreaker applied a smidgen more pressure for comfort. Daybreaker sighed. "Did you know that you were my pride? I could always count upon you to the correct thing. To put Harmony above all else."\n\n"I... I..."\n\n"Yet you're continuing to fight against Harmony's will." Daybreaker traced her hoof to be below Twilight's chin, and craned it up so they were looking at each other. "You're lost. Confused. The answers you seek are here. You must simply open your eyes." Warmly smiling, she leaned down slightly and nuzzled Twilight.\n\nTwilight winced, but she asked, "H-How can anypony be helped?"\n\nHer grin expanding further, Daybreaker used her magic to unlatch the chains, and extended a hoof to help Twilight stand. "By leading by example. By showing them what true Harmony is. By guiding them in my Order."\n\nCowering back from Daybreaker's hoof temporarily, Twilight hesitantly took it, and raised herself to her hooves. "What about ponies who don't want to follow?"\n\nDaybreaker's eyes flashed with fire. "Then they shall be enlightened. And you shall enlighten them, Sunrise Sparkle.""
  solarreworked.209.a:0 "I think that has a nice ring to it, don't you?"
  solarreworked.210.t:0 "The Defiant Niece"
  solarreworked.210.d:0 ""Ah, Cadance, what a pleasure for you to agree to my summons." Without looking away from the book that she was reading, Daybreaker motioned for Cadance to enter her quarters. Practically being shoved in by a couple of guards, Cadance grunted and flared her wings aggressively, however, she could do little in account of inhibitor ring placed around her horn.\n\nDaybreaker smirked.\n\n"It wasn't like I had much choice," Cadance grumbled as her wings folded back against her sides. Looking up at her horn, she snarled, "Although I'm surprised that they're keeping me in here alone, when I could use this—"\n\n"Please, it's not in your nature. Besides—" Daybreaker forced back a yawn as she put away her book. A book on relational advice. "—I could easily incinerate you where you stand before you could think." Quirking her lips upward in a sneer, she tittered, "So don't try it."\n\n"Did you call me here, just to make fun of me?! Aren't you happy enough, corrupting Celestia like you did?! Haven't you already made Harmony a mockery?" As a lock of her mane fell in front of her face, Cadance growled. "Didn't you already make your point clear when you 'visited' us?"\n\n"Can't an aunt want to spend more time with her niece?" Daybreaker countered, visibly brushing off every accusation with a dismissive wave of a forehoof. Stepping around her desk, Daybreaker practically stalked forward, her eyes glowing in interest. "Should I not wish for us to mend our relationship?"\n\n"Never!" spat Cadance. With each advance Daybreaker made, she retreated in kind, and occasionally checked her back to ensure she wouldn't be cornered. "You're a monster! You're no better than Sombra!"\n\nAt that, Daybreaker paused, and she shook her head and tsked. Pain on her face, Daybreaker inquired, "Do you really think that of me?" Cadance's glower was all that Daybreaker needed. "I suppose you do. What do you propose, Cady?"\n\n"Don't call me that! You don't have a right to—"\n\n"I am your aunt!" Pressing a forehoof onto her chest, Daybreaker stepped forward again, a hurt expression on her muzzle. "I do what I must for my ponies out of love, yet YOU have the gall to call me the monster! Tell me, Mi Amore Cadenza, do you feel like YOU are sinless?"\n\n"D-Don't you dare twist—"\n\n"Perhaps you will listen to reason.""
  solarreworked.210.a:0 "Who's the real monster?"
  solarreworked.211.t:0 "The Misguided Niece"
  solarreworked.211.d:0 ""Tell me, Mi Amore Cadenza," Daybreaker hurled at Cadance, emphasizing each syllable with a harsh snarl, "If you were to set my Empire 'free,' what would it involve?" Assessing Cadance, she watched as Cadance took another couple of steps backward, but bumped quickly into the wall of Daybreaker's quarters. "If I am such a monster, what would it involve to rid my ponies of myself? Would my ponies even want that?"\n\n"I-I know there must!" Cadance pursed her lips. However, between the wall and the narrowing distance between her and Daybreaker, she didn't really have room to flee. "There will always be ponies who fight against tyrants like you!"\n\n"'Tyrants?'" Daybreaker inquired, her eyes flashing with curiosity. Stopping and standing straight, she tilted her head and repeated, "'Tyrants,' hmm? What if I'm not seen as a tyrant? What if I'm adored? What if ponies follow me out of the strength I provide and the protection I offer? What then?"\n\nCadance bit her lip. Advancing closer still, Daybreaker prodded with a matronly tone, "What then, Cadance?"\n\n"Y-You'd be controlling them! Through fear, or, or through magic, or—"\n\n"I lead through power!" Briefly, Daybreaker's mane flashed a brighter, hotter blue, and she bared her teeth, but it quickly faded. "What makes you believe that my ponies have been coerced? As you arrived, you must have seen how they praise me. Would that do that with you, if you overthrew me?"\n\n"I never—"\n\n"Would you earn their support, or would you have to force them to love you? What would you do if you large groups refused to follow you? Would you strike them down for stability? Would you enchant them to long for your orders? Is that not what Sombra would have done?" Daybreaker's expression grew dourer. As a couple of tears started to glisten in Cadance's eyes, Daybreaker got within hoof's reach. Reaching out and forward with a wing, she gently touched Cadance's shoulder and asked, "Would he not have forced everypony to follow him, whether they wanted to or not?"\n\n"I... that's not..."\n\n"But you would have to. Destroying me would lead to destruction of Equestria and Harmony. What then?" When Cadance remained silent, Daybreaker withdrew her wing and turned. She heard Cadance slump to the floor, and grinned."
  solarreworked.211.a:0 "What else, my niece?"
  solarreworked.212.t:0 "The Selfish Niece"
  solarreworked.212.d:0 "As she marched to the balcony in her room, Daybreaker caught a few quiet whimpers from Cadance. She kept herself faced away. Inhaling some of the fresh air that gently blew off the balcony, she stared out at [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and sighed. "Cadance, you DO realize that my ponies would move the world for me?  I am their strength and shield. I am Harmony and Order, perfected. If you were to kill me, or overthrow me, whether you established yourself, Luna, or another on the throne, you would never be loved."\n\nCadance choked back a sob. With a sputter, she hissed, "They'd... they'd see that I was doing it for them?"\n\n"And my actions are not in their best interest? If you went down into the streets of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Ponyville, Vanhoover, or others, would you find somepony who believed I wasn't for their best?" Stretching forth a hoof to swipe through the air in order to indicate the capital, Daybreaker looked back at Cadance. Cadance was in a heap, barely able to sit as a few tears dripped onto the marble floor tiles. Streaks of mascara trickled down her cheeks, but she managed to keep from weeping outright.\n\nRotating back, Daybreaker inquired, "I knew that you didn't wish to come here. If you strike me down, perhaps you would take it. But what then? In this world where I am no longer, what would you do? What would you say?" Daybreaker lowered her head slightly. As a sneer formed on her muzzle, she inquired, "What would you say to Flurry?"\n\n"Don't—"\n\n"Oh, but I shall." Daybreaker spun. With heavy hoofbeats toward Cadance, she marched back, and stood tall over her niece. Yet concern laced her words. "Because one day, she will ask why ponies in Equestria whisper behind the monarchy's back, or why resentment is palpable in the streets. Or, if you make everypony love you, why nopony seems natural. Why they will do whatever is asked, no matter how inane. How would you tell her you were the one to create this suffering? Would you tell her it was solely because you believed that I was the monster?"\n\nCadance didn't reply. At first, she merely looked at the floor. Seconds passed and silenced reigned. Then, the floodgates crumbled."
  solarreworked.212.a:0 "Would you want that for her?"
  solarreworked.213.t:0 "Heartbroken"
  solarreworked.213.d:0 "Carefully descending onto her knees, Daybreaker stared at Cadance for a moment as the other alicorn sniffled and whimpered. Clear puddles of tears slowly expanded while Cadance shivered and quaked as she was racked with sobs, yet Daybreaker simply watched. A faint smirk touched the edge of her mouth, and she reached out a hoof to rest on Cadance's shoulder.\n\nWith a small gasp, Cadance's crying momentarily halted, and she looked to Daybreaker; her eyes gleamed, and a few of the faint blood vessels within slowly growing redder with each passing moment. She worked her jaw a couple of times, but could only cough out a couple of letters.\n\n"There's no need to fight," Daybreaker finally stated, placing a bit more pressure on Cadance's shoulder. "You care for your ponies, and my own, as much as I do. You have only been misled. Dogmatic beliefs that have no place in the modern era." Her expression hardened slightly. "Order gives rise to Harmony. Only through it can ponies hope to remain safe, secure, and free." Cadance still remained silent.\n\nTenderly letting out a coo, much like a mother would with a daughter, Daybreaker moved closer, and nuzzled Cadance's head briefly. Some of Cadance's tears stained Daybreaker's fur, but she brushed them quickly off before continuing, "Our ponies need guidance. They still live in fear. There are still enemies ahoof." She gazed directly into Cadance's eyes. "They need assurance and stability. They need somepony who can encourage them to find fellowship in each other, no matter how trying the times. They need a strong role model of the modern Imperial family."\n\nWithdrawing from the quasi-embrace, she rested a hoof on Cadance's chest before declaring, "They need somepony like you."\n\n"I-I can't. They can't if they see me—"\n\n"They will LOVE you, Cadance. And just like how I care for you, you will care for them." A small sneer, sinister and foreboding, crawled upon Daybreaker's muzzle. "And those that do not wish to listen, they will be provided correction.""
  solarreworked.213.a:0 "What say you, Heartbreaker?"
  solarreworked.214.t:0 "The Protege's Protege"
  solarreworked.214.d:0 ""I want to talk to Spike." Daybreaker turned from a couple of nobles to whom she was speaking in the throne room at the declaration. Arching a brow, she watched Sunrise Sparkle march into the room, flanked by a hoofful of soldiers who were meticulously dressed in parade uniform. Nothing but perfection, like their mistress wanted.\n\n"Do you now?" inquired Daybreaker, briefly looking to the nobles and waving them off with a hoof. As both bowed and departed hastily between Sunrise's procession, Daybreaker calmly stalked toward her Lady Inquisitor. "And why is that?" She eyed Sunrise. "Feeling remorse? Guilt? Loneliness?"\n\n"None, my Empress," Sunrise replied, stiffening and staring straight ahead. In her eyes, the brilliant beams of color from the various stained-glass windows in the throne room reflected like a kaleidoscope. Sunrise's gaze grew colder. "He is useful."\n\n"How?"\n\nStartled, Sunrise blinked a couple of times before she stated, "H-He has been a valuable assistant to me before... I was enlightened. He knows how I think. He can point out details I sometimes miss."\n\nDaybreaker hummed. Wrinkling her brow, she got within a few inches of Sunrise's face and stared her down. Nothing she could see hinted at anything behind Sunrise's motives. She stepped back. "You usher him into my Order as well? Would your time not be better spent extracting information from prisoners?" She curled her lip upward. "There are always threats that could topple Harmony."\n\n"Perhaps, Empress, but I believe I will work more efficiently with him. Besides, I believe I will be the only one who can get through to him." For a second, her eyes flashed with excitement, and it was long enough that Daybreaker discerned the change in her mood.\n\nStepping to one of the nearby motes of lava gently meandering through the throne room, Daybreaker beckoned Sunrise. "Sunrise, I feel you are not being entirely truthful."\n\nAt that, Sunrise bit her lip and she exhaled, "I-I suppose I DO want some company."\n\n"Am I not enough? Are not all those who follow me sufficient?"\n\n"Of course! But we are like siblings! I miss him. I want him to know what I know." Sunrise's eyes sparkled excitedly. Breaking decorum, she grabbed one of Daybreaker's forehooves, and declared, "Imagine how great a team we could be if we worked together! I just want to give it a try! I-If he doesn't accept, then—" She sighed. "He can be dealt with as a rebel."\n\nSmiling, Daybreaker nodded. "Very well. You have one chance."\n\nWith a whinny of glee, Sunrise let go and trotted off, and Daybreaker hid a titter."
  solarreworked.214.a:0 "Use it well."
  solarreworked.215.t:0 "The Resilient Assitant"
  solarreworked.215.d:0 "Casting his gaze around nervously, Spike took in the resplendent marble and gleaming gold that lined the castle in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], making the room that he was kept in appear like it was the middle of the day, despite the now-waning sunlight of the evening. Two stallions, dressed in military uniform, and glowing with fire-retardant enchantments, stood on either side of him. Neither met his gaze.\n\nWhat he was doing in the castle was still beyond him. When he was separated from Twilight, he had been left in one of the cells of the castle, and basically ignored since then. Aside from the same meal of a single, low-quality gem, and numerous, almost inedible sandwiches, he had been left alone. Nopony had shown him any interest.\n\nTo say that his mind was racing, knowing that Daybreaker could very well be finally dealing with him, would be an understatement. Yet, between the guards, his chains, and the locked room, there was no easy way out. All he could do was count rubies and hope. Maybe Daybreaker was feeling lenient.\n\nHeart skipping a beat when he heard a latch on the door, he forced back a breath when a young alicorn trotted through the door. Stuttering anxiously as soon as she laid eyes on him, he exclaimed, "Twilight?!"\n\nImmediately, Twilight galloped toward Spike and she pulled him into an embrace, wrapping her wings gently around him. "Spike!" she choked out, as he felt a tear or two trickle down her muzzle onto his scales. "I missed you!" It only took a second or two for him to return the hug, and she coughed some tears. However, they didn't stay like that for long, as Twilight looked up and nodded.\n\n"You're dismissed," she stated solemnly, even if there was still a hint of lingering emotion in her voice.\n\nThe stallions saluted, and one declared, "As you command, Lady Inquisitor."\n\nAs they marched out of the room, Spike's brain replayed what he heard. "'Lady Inquisitor?'" he asked. His eyes started to sting. Details that had been unnoticed in his elation at seeing Twilight began to pop out. Her fur was lighter, her mane now only had a single, blood-red streak in it, and her cutie mark...\n\nIt was blinding.\n\n"Yes, Spike," Twilight replied with a nod. "I serve Equestria now."\n\n"Y-You mean Daybreaker!" he retorted, jabbing a claw at her. At Twilight's confusion, he snapped, "W-What happened to friendship? Magic? Harmony?!"\n\nA sad smile twinging her muzzle, Twilight merely answered, "Oh, Spike, I guess I'll have to give you a few lessons.""
  solarreworked.215.a:0 "You pick up quick, though."

  solarreworked.216.d:0 ""What do I need to learn?! That you think Daybreaker's right?!" Spike barked, fruitlessly shoving back at Twilight. While it didn't move her far, she did take a few steps further back. Her eyes glistened with a fresh pain, although whether it was him, or something else, he couldn't say.\n\n"Spike."\n\n"No! This isn't you, Twilight! This is... this is whatever Daybreaker did to you!" Tapping on his head a couple of times with a claw, he added as his spines bristled, "You gotta snap out of it! M-Maybe it's some mind control magic, and you're in there, fighting, and you just need—"\n\n"Spike, this is me." Twilight drew both her wings up and down her front, indicating her entire appearance. With a cautious step toward him, she stated, "I'm still the pony you know." While she did smile, to him, it seemed fake. Perhaps it was the rapid speed she formed it, or the slightly too wide spread, or that her eyes weren't sparkling like they normally did when she was happy, but it rubbed him the wrong way.\n\nHe shivered. "N-No! You'd never help some crazy pony like Daybreaker! You didn't believe any of Chrysalis's lies when she impersonated Cadance! You saw through Cozy Glow's lies!" As warm rivulets of tears dribbled down his cheeks, he clasped both his hands together and implored, "Please, Twilight! You've gotta fight it!"\n\nTwilight's expression hardened. "Oh, Spike..." She shook her head. Drawing herself straighter, she looked back at the door, and powered her magic. It clicked tight, and the deadbolt fastened. "There's nothing to fight." With a small chuckle, she approached him and bent down. He bared his teeth, and she gently tapped him on the nose.\n\n"I'm helping preserve Order. Community! With them, we'll still have friendship and harmony." Her grin grew sinister. "It's just that a few eggs need to be cracked. There's danger in the world. You know that. [GRD.GetNameDef]? [WNG.GetNameDef]? [CHN.GetNameDef]? These and more." Holding up a hoof, she exclaimed, "Oh! Can't forget ponies within Equestria that endanger others."\n\n"By arresting them! What happened to tolerance and understanding? What about friendship?"\n\nSuppressing a giggle, Twilight stood straight and shook her head. "Spike, I have more friends now than I know what to do with! Everypony who helps the Empress is my friend!" She tilted her head. "Don't you want to still be my friend? My number one assistant?"\n\nAt those words, Spike felt as if a knife blade had been twisted into his gut."

  solarreworked.217.d:0 ""T-This can't be happening!" Spike clutched at his head as he sat back onto the floor. As he did, the chains that bound his legs together clinked and clattered, echoing throughout the room. What little sunlight there was left that came through the window looking out onto [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] made it appears as if the whole floor was on fire. The orange and red glow bounced back up to illuminate Twilight, who stared at Spike expectantly.\n\n"Y-You can't believe this! You overcame Discord! You stopped Tirek! Y-You reformed Starlight and Sunset! Y-Y-You can't just—" Whatever words were left in his throat died as a couple of hiccuping sobs escaped his lips. "J-Just stop it! S-Say this is all a ruse! You're pretending so that Daybreaker will slip up and—"\n\nWith a motherly clicking of her tongue, Twilight sat in front of Spike and rested a forehoof on one of his legs. He paused in his weeping for a second to stare deeply into her eyes. The same purple eyes that he had known for his entire life. Yet, they were foreign. Pain, love, but also anger. Enough to make him cower back as he continued to peer at her.\n\nWhen she saw his reaction, she tsked. Her voice and face darkening, she stated, "Of course, you COULD possibly escape. Maybe if you played a ruse and attacked me, you could render me unconscious. Possibly you could even find a way to take me out of [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but what then, Spike? My purpose is higher than just making friends. It's preserving Harmony!" She curled a hoof triumphantly. After a second, she looked back at him. "I could use my number one assistant for that."\n\nShe smiled. Genuinely. "If you fled, you'd be alone, forever. Nopony could help you. They understand how to sacrifice for the greater Harmony." Inching closer to him, her voice grew quieter, more compassionate. "It's so hard to run my experiments without backup." She rolled her eyes. "Sure, the Empress gives me plenty of assistants, but—" She tapped his chest "—they aren't MY assistant."\n\nWhen Spike didn't respond, she let out a small whine and used her magic to pull him toward her. "Spike, I just want my little brother back. It can be like how things used to be." Spike's only answer were the tears staining her fur."

  solarreworked.218.d:0 "For how long the two creatures, the pony and the drake, sat there, Spike couldn't tell. The months of separation had left his heart feeling raw, and although at first he had found Twilight's words too outlandish to believe, every statement slowly chipped away at his resolve. It was like a changeling was speaking out of a disguise. It was her vocabulary, her voice, her mannerisms. But it wasn't her! Was it?\n\nThrough it all, Twilight had been gently rubbing his spines, moving them back and forth to try and comfort him. Every so often, she hushed him soothingly, the same way that she would back before they first left Canterlot when he was nervous. Still, it wasn't her! At least, it wasn't who she was...\n\n"Spike, won't you help me?" she finally inquired, unlocking her chin from resting on his head. He gazed up at her, and saw a few tears trickling down her own muzzle. As a her mouth twisted into a frown, she muttered, "I just want to make sure you're safe. I want my number one assistant back."\n\nSpike coughed. Wiping at his eyes, he sniffed, "Y-Yeah, right. I-I've seen the castle halls. Ponies love her. It's like they're all mind-controlled." He grunted and furrowed his brow into a glower. "Y-You're no different! Y-You're just as mind controlled as the rest." However, his heart felt like it was being dragged down to Tartarus.\n\n"Spike!" Twilight exclaimed, her wings flaring back instinctively. She placed a hoof on her chest. "I love Daybreaker like everypony else! She's Harmony itself, how could I not? But... I still care about you! I still care about my friends!" Taking one of his claws in her hooves, she asked, "Won't you help me?!" The sinking sensation in his chest only increased, much like a whirlpool sucking debris into the Mareanis Trench.\n\nTwilight sighed. Hanging her head, she powered her horn and in a blink of magic, a stack of comic books appeared next to him. "I got you these. Found them in Manehattan." When he stared at them in shock, she added, "The initial printing of the first ten issues of the Power Ponies. All mint." There was a small note, stating it was "Sunrise's number one assistant."\n\nHis vision hazy, he asked, "Twilight?" She answered with a smile, and then the floodgates burst. Softly hiccuping, Spike leaned forward and into Twilight's embrace. The only thing he could do was nod.\n\nHe didn't see the grin twist into a sneer on Sunrise's muzzle."

  solarreworked.500.d:0 "Even before the Empress ascended to the throne, the old lands of Equestria were the dominant naval power on Equus and the world, rivaled only by [GRD.GetNameDef] and [HIP.GetNameDef]. The old admiralty took pride in the ships that sailed under the flag, and as centuries passed, wood gave way to steel, which was spurred by a desire to maintain modernity with the two Equestrian naval rivals. However, that ultimate navy has aged, and younger nations have striven to take our crown and with new technologies appearing frequently, our old flagship is barely worthy of being used by the Empress.\n\nShe has decreed that a new class of warship, the Daybreak Class, shall be constructed on an advanced technology platform. Multiple proposals have been made, between an untouchable and heavily armed cruiser, an unstoppable battleship, or a carrier that can swarm the skies with fighters. It merely remains to be seen which shall be chosen by the Empress."
