Yet every day, more ponies flock across the Celestial Sea to our lands, and the space with which we can house them is ever dwindling. To combat this, [ROOT.GetLeader] has announced a grand vision: one day, a New Mareland stretching across all of the Discovery Coast, and south to the heartland of the cursed [WNG.GetAdjective]s. In accordance with the Empress's desires, everypony within [ROOT.GetNameDef] will be safe and secure, and may live out their days in comfort.\n\nThe griffons have worn out their welcome. It is time for the age of the pony to begin."
