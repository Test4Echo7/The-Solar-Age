  news.solarage.1.d_a:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today marks a new chapter in Equestrian history as Princess Celestia has officially dissolved the Equestrian government, disbanded the diarchy, and declared herself sole ruler of Equestria. In response, her sister, Princess Luna, reportedly attempted to halt her ascension and was forced to flee Canterlot after a short, magical clash. Reports indicate that she fled to Manehattan, where she has formed a rival governemnt and has promised to resist Celestia's efforts to "destroy everything for which Equestria once stood." Both sides have mobilized. Equestria's future appears uncertain."
  news.solarage.1.d_b:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]At the break of dawn in Canterlot, gunfire and magical blasts filled the sky, as a coalition of nobles, republicans, and liberals have declared rebellion against the rule of Princess Celestia. The Princess has officially disbanded the government, dissolved the diarchy, and vested sole executive power with herself. As she hosted her coronation as Empress of the new Solar Empire, groups of rebels attempted to halt it. The Eastern seaboard has seceded and mobilized loyalists. In response, Celestia has responded with force. Time can only tell what will be come of Equestria's future."
  news.solarage.1.d_c:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Fires have consumed much of the Equestrian countryside as ponies have turned against each other. Princess Celestia has officially dissolved the Equestrian government, disbanded the diarchy, and declared herself sole ruler of Equestria. Although she had tried to secure her rule, her excessively repressive acts have spurred the unions and working class to mobilize around a socialist republic. In response to both, nobles, republicans, and liberals seceded around Manehattan. All sides have mobilized forces. Battles involving all have left thousands dead. Equestria's future looks dark." #Currently unused until a peasant rebellion is programmed in

  news.solarage.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]As the sun reached its zenith over Canterlot, Princess Celestia held a grand speech from Canterlot Castle, proclaiming that Equestria as it once was no longer exists. Dressed in golden armor, she declared herself as Daybreaker Sun, Empress of the new Solar Empire. Over the last few months, she has reshuffled her government and efficiently crushed open dissent. The fate of Princess Luna is unknown, although increasing reports of renewed thestral repression indicate she has either fled or been captured.\n\nWith her rule secured, Daybreaker has promised that she will, quote, "Protect her ponies from all harm: pony, changeling, griffon, or any that threaten Harmony."""

  news.solarage.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Reports are still streaming in from the land of Equestria, as armies led by the Solar Empire's Empress Daybreaker and the Lunar Empire's Empress Nightmare Moon clashed today with both alicorns at the helm. From eyewitness accounts, the fighting between both sides quickly tapered as the sisters challenged each other in magical combat. The sky filled with beams of blue and red magic as both alicorns strove for dominance, carving desolate tracts in the battlefield by themselves. In a speech to her troops, Daybreaker has claimed victory and proudly pronounced Nightmare Moon's injury. The Lunar Empress has yet to comment."

  news.solarage.20.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today marks a new point in history across the world. Only a few hours ago, [ROOT.GetNameDef] was rocked with a blast that glassed the landscape for tens of miles in all directions. Witnesses from across the nation report that a blinding beam of light descended from the sky, cutting through any clouds, and vaporized anything caught within the blast.\n\nSettlements that were near the impact have been completely erased, with nothing left but ash and a smattering of the strongest buildings surviving as skeletons. So far it is unsafe to travel to the affected area, as temperatures are still lethal for anything living.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] proclaimed that it is because of their conflict with [EQS.GetLeader] and has vowed that [ROOT.GetNameDef] will fight to its last to resist [EQS.GetLeader.GetHerHis] tyranny."

Those closest to the impact site that survived were knocked from their hooves or swatted from the sky and left scarred and deformed with third degree burns.\n\nWhere the city once stood there is nothing more than piles of ash, charred and skeletal buildings, and superheated dirt that has been completely turned to glass and obsidian. Across the stretch of the megalopolis, fires continue to rage. Reports indicate no survivors but [CHN.GetLeader] has been confirmed to have escaped.\n\nAs of yet [CHN.GetLeader.GetSheHe] has not made a statement, but the Wehrmacht has promised to continue their fight against [EQS.GetNameDef], now to the bitter end."

Since her defeat in the civil war between [EQS.GetNameDef] and [NLR.GetNameDef], she has been purportedly held captive within [EQS.GetLeader]'s dungeons and used as a showpiece of [EQS.GetLeader]'s might and justice. In the following hours, Nightmare Moon has been given control [BAT.GetNameDef]'s military and government and has promised that she will avenge her humiliation and the thestral oppression by [EQS.GetLeader]. [EQS.GetLeader] has condemned her, and sworn complete immolation of [BAT.GetNameDef] as retribution."
