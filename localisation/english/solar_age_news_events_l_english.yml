Reports indicate that she fled to Manehattan, where she has formed a rival governemnt and has promised to resist Celestia's efforts to "destroy everything for which Equestria once stood." Both sides have mobilized. Equestria's future appears uncertain."

The Princess has officially disbanded the government, dissolved the diarchy, and vested sole executive power with herself. As she hosted her coronation as Empress of the new Solar Empire, groups of rebels attempted to halt it. The Eastern seaboard has seceded and mobilized loyalists. In response, Celestia has responded with force. Time can only tell what will be come of Equestria's future."

However, eyewitness reports from sailors in the bay near Moonspeaker Hollow claim that the [EQS.GetAdjectiveCap] military stormed the city and began to torch everything in sight. Additionally, there was little coordinated resistance from the already-battered thestrals.\n\nAs word of this atrocity has spread across Zebrica, [EQS.GetLeader] has declared that they are lies spread by thestral sympathizers or the few remaining Chiropterran agents at large.

There has been little comment from [EQS.GetNameDef], but rumors indicate that soldiers marched into the cities throughout Chiropterra and burnt them to the ground. Current casualty numbers are unknown, but for an operation of the scale that occurred, estimates are high.\n\n[EQS.GetLeader] has publicly declared that the Chiropterrans have been purified and that the land of Chiropterra has been made whole once again. In the wake of the torching of the cities, a convoy of military vessels and transports were seen docking in Firstport, with the flagship bearing the standard of [EQS.GetLeader].

Before her coronation, Grover VI was brought before the attendees, so that he could deliver a speech proclaiming his forebears' inability to maintain stability within the Empire requiring an outsider solution. After the coronation, the crowd burst into jeers and boos, which were quickly silenced by the pony garrison that had been brought from the Solar Empire.\n\nAddressing her new subjects, Daybreaker promised them security and safety, if they would obey her like her ponies.

Where [153.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] had been is nothing more than a crater, filled with burning wreckage of the Palace of the Soviets. Hundreds of blocks of housing have been obliterated, with nothing to indicate that ponies once lived in the thriving industrial town and worked for the good of the [FROM.GetNameDef] proletariat.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] has already taken to the radio to denounce the "heinous acts" of the [EQS.GetAdjectiveCap] capitalists and fascists and has sworn that [FROM.GetNameDef] will fight to the last pony for the dream of a free working class. Although it has been suppressed, reports that have slipped out indicate that the destruction of [153.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has dealt a heavy blow to the [FROM.GetAdjective] war effort, as most of its leadership was killed, and many of its factories lost in the strike. Every day, the hope of a liberated working class grows dimmer and dimmer."

Ships that were heading to harbor within the city and that were far enough away report a giant beam of light falling upon the city, blooming out across the horizon. When the light finally faded, nothing remained of the city except some sporadic fires and a few cadavers of buildings lucky enough to not be incinerated in the blast.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] was away for trade negotiations at the time, and was spared the horror of seeing [FROM.GetLeader.GetHerHis] city leveled by an unstoppable force. Hundreds of thousands of zebras lost their lives in an instant, and only the shadows of their final actions can be seen on the rubble that is still there. Even more refugees have fled to the surrounding regions, some severely injured from the intense heat and thereby straining medical supplies in their new homes.

Although the day was cloudy, the light sliced through the cover like it was mist, and engulfed the center of the city while melting to slag many of the centuries old residences that surrounded the oldest seapony pools. What is left of the royal palace is nothing more than a half-extant husk, almost cleanly separated by the width of the magical pillar.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the mountain itself appears to have become destabilized, as landslides and rockfalls have become commonplace and buried districts that survived. The Harmonizing Heights have been leveled, and hippogriffs and seaponies alike mourn the loss of one of their great, cultural blessings. Evacuations and search parties have ramped up as the mountain threatens to collapse at any time, and [FROM.GetLeader], who was governing in Seaquestria at the time, has returned to aid in the emergency response.

Across Northern Zebrica, creatures could see the bright beam of magic descend from the sky to land somewhere within [FROM.GetNameDef]'s territory. Those closest to the border confirmed that it was aimed at [712.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Unlike other uses of this weapon, the pillar of light lasted for almost ten minutes, rather than one or two.\n\nLittle information from [FROM.GetNameDef] has surfaced, but it can be assured that [712.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has been vaporized. The mountain itself into which it was built has been flattened according to aerial photography, and the forests around it that were not turned to ash immediately are an inferno. Extreme heat from the impact zone has already radiated through most of Northern Zebrica, raising temperatures by degrees in neighboring nations. As [FROM.GetNameDef] has yet to make an official statement, it can only be assumed that their leadership is alive, but if any nation could survive, it is [FROM.GetNameDef]."
