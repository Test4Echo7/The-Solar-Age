Princess Celestia has officially dissolved the Equestrian government, disbanded the diarchy, and declared herself sole ruler of Equestria. Although she had tried to secure her rule, her excessively repressive acts have spurred the unions and working class to mobilize around a socialist republic. In response to both, nobles, republicans, and liberals seceded around Manehattan. All sides have mobilized forces. Battles involving all have left thousands dead. Equestria's future looks dark." #Currently unused until a peasant rebellion is programmed in

  news.solarage.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Reports are still streaming in from the land of Equestria, as armies led by the Solar Empire's Empress Daybreaker and the Lunar Empire's Empress Nightmare Moon clashed today with both alicorns at the helm. From eyewitness accounts, the fighting between both sides quickly tapered as the sisters challenged each other in magical combat. The sky filled with beams of blue and red magic as both alicorns strove for dominance, carving desolate tracts in the battlefield by themselves.
