In response, her sister, Princess Luna, reportedly attempted to halt her ascension and was forced to flee Canterlot after a short, magical clash. Reports indicate that she fled to Manehattan, where she has formed a rival governemnt and has promised to resist Celestia's efforts to "destroy everything for which Equestria once stood." Both sides have mobilized. Equestria's future appears uncertain."

The Princess has officially disbanded the government, dissolved the diarchy, and vested sole executive power with herself. As she hosted her coronation as Empress of the new Solar Empire, groups of rebels attempted to halt it. The Eastern seaboard has seceded and mobilized loyalists. In response, Celestia has responded with force. Time can only tell what will be come of Equestria's future."

In response to both, nobles, republicans, and liberals seceded around Manehattan. All sides have mobilized forces. Battles involving all have left thousands dead.

The fate of Princess Luna is unknown, although increasing reports of renewed thestral repression indicate she has either fled or been captured.\n\nWith her rule secured, Daybreaker has promised that she will, quote, "Protect her ponies from all harm: pony, changeling, griffon, or any that threaten Harmony."""

Despite the fear that must still grip them at the use of concentrated solar energy on their home territory, every surviving griffon has swore vengeance on the "pony menace."\n\nWhile the mountain that once held the great tree that kept the city suspended burns with unquenchable fires, crimes against pony minorities in various griffon nations have jumped a hundredfold, with police and governments doing nothing to stop it. Governments across the world have decried the sacrilegious destruction of a world heritage site, but [EQS.GetLeader] has dismissed them all as short-sighted and collaborators against Harmony.\n\nThis action has won [EQS.GetNameDef] no favors, and will stay a permanent stain on their international record until the end of time."

Those closer that are alive claim that it was aimed square at the Kaiserschloss itself. Regardless of rumors, the fact remains that where the center of [382.GetCapitalVictoryPoint] once stood is now nothing more than a giant crater of glass.\n\nFires rage across the outskirts of the city which survived, their inhabitants cooked by the extreme heat or alive and suffering extensive burns, its section of the Griffking has been evaporated, and the Grand Temple of Boreas has been reduced to cinders.

The beam was supposedly focused on the three temples of the griffon gods, and nothing remains of their great structures.\n\nMuch like the sacking of the city by Grover II, the psychological damage wrought by this strike has already been felt in the psyche of the [JER.GetAdjective] griffon. Mass desertion and surrender to [EQS.GetAdjectiveCap] forces has become commonplace among their ranks, as they seek to receive leniency from [EQS.GetLeader]. Thus far, there have been no confirmation if these surrenders have been honored. In the meantime, [377.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] lays ablaze, with what was not glassed instead burning with magical fire.

Before the unstable land collapsed and allowed the sea to flood into the new sinkhole, the city was consumed by fire as the air burned from the intense heat of the concentrated, magical beam of sunlight. The Imperial Forum and Amphitheater were two of the first to be destroyed, their ancient materials weakened already by age. A few griffons on the periphery tried to flee, but were knocked from the sky or burned alive from their proximity.\n\nAlthough [FROM.GetLeader] was away at the time, [FROM.GetLeader.GetSheHe] has promised to hold a memorial to all the "brave griffons who died for our freedom."

Although nocreature initially went to confirm, later scout plane flybys have shown that the entire city of undead has been incinerated. Even the usually resilient monsters do not appear to have survived the blast, if only because they were vaporized in the process.\n\nThe snowy wastes around the city have been turned to clean, glassy hills, with nary a flake of white in sight. The latest scout reports claim that Rosa Maledicta managed to survive, although the entire city is now useless. Not even the most powerful magics could withstand a direct blast of energy from the sun.
