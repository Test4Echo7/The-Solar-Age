  blueblood_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! §L1st of June, 974 ALB in Canterlot§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §LPrince Blueblood is one of the few privileged in Canterlot who can claim a familial relationship with Princess Celestia, although it certainly was not by her choice. Around a century prior to his birth, Blueblood's great-grandmother, Silk Stocking, was adopted by Princess Celestia for her charity work, friendship, and like-minded attitude. Additionally, his ancestor was there for the Princess at one of her lowest lows on the nine hundredth anniversary of Luna's banishment. This memory of Celestia's close friend was one of the only reasons that she deigned on the young Blueblood the title of Prince of Equestria, for he certainly did not reflect her.\n\nFrom his youth, he frequently bragged about his unique status as a nephew – albeit an adoptive one – of Celestia and how he "had her ear" on any issue that arose, especially if they were relevant to him. As he was almost the same age as Celestia's student, Sunset Shimmer, it was not uncommon to see him torment her or other staff of the castle. In time, though, his outward maliciousness faded and he merely became bored by the doldrums of having everything he wanted. In time, after Sunset's disappearance, he entertained himself with suitors, whom he would routinely either turn down, or court for perhaps a week or two and promise them the world before ending the relationship. These proclivities eventually morphed into toying with every mare who latched onto him by dismissing them as gold diggers, hosting raucous parties to never attend, or starting ridiculous trends in the Canterlot fashion scene to see if they would catch on.\n\nHowever, after the Grand Galloping Gala in 1001, where he was humiliated by Rarity for his behavior, he began to re-evaluate his priorities. With the failed invasion by Chrysalis in 1002, his ennui gave him a stroke of inspiration. Through ancient laws that were never written away, he purchased himself a commission and quickly rose to the rank of Field Marshal of Equestria. Although the talk of Canterlot was that he'd soon grow tired of the rigors of military life, as the highest officer in the land after Shining Armor's departure to the Crystal Empire, he rarely visited the field. His instructional time was far less than most, but he has taken to time outside of his duties to studying war. Still, he's nothing but a colt playing with toy soldiers, and field experience is the far greater teacher. His underlings have protested of his harsh treatment, but at the moment, Princess Celestia has seen fit to continue his commission. Somewhere, she claims, there will be a moment where he'll become a true stallion. Whether that gets thousands of ponies killed remains to be seen.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"
  fluttershy_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! §L10th of October, 983 ALB in Cloudsdale§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §LFluttershy is the resident caretaker of the animals in Ponyville and also the bearer of the Element of Kindness. As she is quiet, she doesn't speak much about her life growing up in Cloudsdale, other than it was frequently terrifying, frightening, or mortifying. One of her only solaces from the torments of school and the frustration at home with her younger brother, Zephyr Breeze, was her friend Rainbow Dash. However, that friendship still sometimes brought her into the line of social fire, as it were, since Rainbow commonly butted heads with schoolyard bullies and thereby made her a tangential target at inopportune times for her. Otherwise known as every time.\n\nTo her parents, it appeared that she'd never find her special talent, given how meek and fearful a soul she was. While they were not oft to stand up for themselves either, Fluttershy had seemed to inherit both of their passive natures. However, that began to change when Rainbow Dash performed a sonic rainboom while racing her schoolyard rivals in a competition she was dared into during flight camp, which accidentally knocked Fluttershy to the ground far below. As she was saved by a flock of butterflies, she soon discovered her reciprocated love of animals, to the point she understood them as if talking with ponies.\n\nIn the ensuing years, she moved to Ponyville, the site of where she first discovered her special talent, and became a friend to all the woodland creatures of the area. Her later friendship with Twilight Sparkle pushed her far beyond her boundaries, and that bond she had developed in her a strong, kind, but firm assertiveness when necessary. To that end, it rocked the news world when Fluttershy applied for the head researcher position of the megaspell project. Although she intends it for only healing purposes, her colleagues already have other... aggressive intentions for such magic and may prove to be too overwhelming for her, despite her hidden steadfastness.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"
  limestone_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! §L17th of June, 980 ALB outside of Rockville§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §LLimestone Pie, full name Limestone Daffodil Pie, is the eldest sister of the Pie siblings and takes her responsibility as such far more seriously than healthy. Growing up on the Pie family's Rock Farm, she took on the brunt of the work before her younger sisters did, which formed much of her hard-working, grouchy demeanor. Since the Pies focused much of their early attention upon her, she did receive the majority of the family ethic, and is a rather ascetic, if grumpy individual.\n\nAlthough at one point Limestone did wish to leave the Rock Farm to study in rocks like her younger sister Maud, her parents convinced her to stay at the farm after Pinkie left to live her own life. The already choleric Limestone grew more irritable and determined after Pinkie departed, on a train to nowhere that eventually ended up in Ponyville. While she doesn't blame her sister for anything, and in fact loves Pinkie as deeply as she does the rest of her family, Limestone does see herself as the one who must guard her family's way of life and preserve the farm for future generations. If asked about what she would be protecting it from, she wouldn't or couldn't give an answer, but she shields it just the same.\n\nCompared to Pinkie Pie, Maud is abrasive and aggressive, as well as commanding and bossy. Whether the years of expectations from her parents ground upon her or she simply would have always ended up a grouch is up to speculation, but few in Rockville worry about haggling or arguing with her, since she frequently gets her way. However, to her family, she is still harsh, but does so out of a care for their safety. With war on the horizon, she has convinced her parents to at last let her go, so that she can serve with the military and protect her home. Her work ethic has already helped her climb through our ranks, and her pushy, berating mindset would be a perfect addition to help hone our infantry's training for being under pressure.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

Elder sister to Pinkie Pie, Maud is a stark contrast to her younger sibling's bubbly personality. Even when she was a young foal, she rarely showed the same range of emotion as any of her other siblings, instead focusing on the rocks that were harvested and their mineral compositions with an almost laser-like focus.\n\nWhile she was still a filly, Maud's interest in rocks, geology, and tectonics paid off when she successfully convinced her parents to shift Holder's Boulder, a piece of family history, exactly seven point six inches to the right of its previous location. To quote her, they took its resting spot for granite. Within a few days, there was a downpour, which eroded some of the last supporting dirt of an old portion of the overhang, and Holder's Boulder was saved from destruction. As she grew older, she left for Rockville proper, where she studied in its premier geology university and earned herself what the ponies there call a rocktorate in rock science.\n\nMany ponies find Maud rather unnerving, as although ponies who live in Rockville and the surrounding rock farms are frequently serious, Maud simply doesn't emote. To everypony she meets, she speaks in a dry, monotone cantor, which makes many question whether she has a shred of empathy in her body. However, they simply have never cracked her shell, as she is extremely protective of both her family and friends.\n\nDue to her rocktorate, she is extremely knowledgeable of the earth, and can find weak points that can shave hours or days off of trench or fortification building. Using her expertise could give us an exceptional advantage in drawn-out conflict.§!"

However, her beginnings are as humble as the average pony, although she received much adoration and encouragement from her parents. Said parents are still her biggest fans.\n\nWhen she was a filly, she already began to show predilections for standing by her friends, as she stood up for her oldest companion, Fluttershy, throughout their shared years in school. Every flying competition she could enter she did, which soon earned her a reputation of both an excellent flier, but also a braggart, as the number of trophies she had continued to climb. On a dare, she agreed to race her rivals, and in the last stretch, sped past the sound barrier to release a sonic rainboom, the only pony to do so.\n\nAfter she earned her cutie mark, she continued to improve her athletic performance, and moved to Ponyville after Fluttershy found her a spot on the local weather team. In her off time, she focused solely on joining the Wonderbolts, and one day did, after Twilight Sparkle's friendship helped to smooth out some of her extremely brash nature and supposedly help with a hidden self-confidence issue. She still remains competitive and arrogant, and her new position as one of the chiefs of staff for Equestria has done nothing to damper them.

Despite being born and raised in the humble town of Ponyville – a fact she frequently leaves out of interviews simply to avoid more questions regarding the culture disparity – her dresses have been worn to the most humble of proms to the Grand Galloping Gala itself, including by the Princesses themselves.\n\nRarity was not raised in high culture, though, even if she now emulates the urban elite in Canterlot in both her mannerisms and form of speech. Rather, she was born to two simple unicorns, and while she loves her parents dearly, their bombastic and loud-mouthed personalities frequently clashed with her thoughtful and ambitious one fiercely. Still, despite her interests in fashion being seen as "wasted bits," she eventually earned her cutie mark in fashion, after a sonic rainboom cracked open a geode containing hundreds of gems, to which her magic led her moments prior. One of her signature flourishes in her designs is embedding at least one or two gemstones into every piece, as, according to her, it brings out the best in anypony's appearance and ties up the whole image.\n\nTo this day, her first boutique, and the one she directly runs, is located in Ponyville, despite her chain now having stores in both Manehattan and Canterlot. While some of her close friends tease her as being prissy or fussy, she considers herself cultured, but that doesn't mean she won't go against her preferences for the sake of others. Tied in with her image as a fashion designer, she is also known as a philanthropist, and will happily give away her expensive dresses to those who can't afford them, which is a policy that both Sassy Saddles and Coco Pommel in Canterlot and Manehattan respectively carry out.\n\nWhen approached, she happily agreed to volunteer her time for Equestria's greater good, especially since she could "fix those horridly outmoded uniforms" which the military still uses.§!\n\n§YPortarit by:§! §LScroup§!"

As the oldest living member of the extensive and Equestria-spanning Apple family, she has experienced much change but still sees how much stays the same. As she was born during the middle of Equestria's industrial revolution, she saw the transition from a general agrarian base to a thriving economy of various refined goods.\n\nFor the first dozen or so years of her life, she lived on the road with her family, traveling from region to region gathering seeds and working as hired hooves between botany sales. In time, they earned appreciation and recognition by the Crown, and were granted a section of land near the Everfree Forest, which became the founding site of Ponyville. A number of other families soon moved when the first harvests planted by the Apples proved ripe and bountiful, and the small village became a proper town in only a generation.\n\nAs a mother, she was stern but caring to her son, Bright Mac, and although the Apples carried a fierce rivalry with another group of farmers, the Pears, she accepted Bright's wife Pear Butter after she was disowned by her parents after marrying. Later in life, she effectively retired to be a homebody, and looked after her grandfoals while Bright and Pear tended to the farm. At times they relied upon her experience dealing with dangers of the Everfree to keep the seasonal help safe, and to ensure that it didn't encroach upon their fields.\n\nWith both of them gone, she has taken a slightly more active role in leading Sweet Apple Acres, but leaves most of it up to her grandson and granddaughter, Big Macintosh and Applejack. She may appear cantankerous and slow, but it is mostly an act for her own entertainment.

  EQS_fizzlepop_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! §L7th of March, 972 ALB in Shire§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §LPony outcasts are a rare sight, and rarer still are ponies who voluntarily reject their homeland. Fizzlepop Berrytwist, formerly known as Tempest Shadow, was one of those ponies. One of her most defining features, her jagged and broken horn, was not always a part of her. Growing up in Shire, she was simply another unicorn filly who had friends, dreams, and aspirations. While she was not the most powerful unicorn, she still was dexterous with her magic and was on track to being able to apply to Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. In a freak accident after going into a cave to find a ball she and her two friends, Spring Rain and Glitter Drops, her horn was destroyed by an enraged Ursa Minor. Only through her two friends' quick thinking and reaction did she survive at all.\n\nYet fate was not kind to Fizzlepop, as her friends found it difficult to be around her, and her depression at no longer attaining her dream sunk deeper. Ultimately, feeling abandoned by her friends and maligned by society at large, she simply left Shire one day, never to return. With no plan and only a few bits in her pocket to pay for travel and food, she stowed away on a ship to Zebrica, where she lived for years scraping by and fighting amongst the destitute rabble there, until she stumbled into the Storm King's ravaging army on its early conquests. With her hardened and bitter demeanor and with a wit that tricked his soldiers to get a chance at him directly, she impressed him enough that he offered her a "once in a lifetime opportunity" as his second-in-command, recently made vacant. She agreed, on the condition that he restore her horn when he had gained the magical power to do so, which was his final goal for his conquests.\n\nAs the Storm King was ravaging country after country on Zebrica, word reached Equestria of him and Celestia sent Twilight and her friends to convince an old peer of Celestia's, Queen Novo of Hippogriffia, to aid them in an assault on his forces and to end his tsunami of terror. Despite some faux pas, the Element Bearers convinced her, and in the ensuing battle of Ain Trogourait, Twilight was captured by Fizzlepop in the chaos of the fight. While it still raged, she brought Twilight to the Storm King, as he could sap her power with an artifact she acquired for him, the Staff of Sacanas. However, after draining Twilight, and with the power of the weather at his claws, he refused to aid Fizzlepop. With her eyes opened, she dueled with him, and was barely saved by Twilight, who intervened and distracted him enough for Tempest to use one of his petrification orbs on him.\n\nAlthough she still feels like an outcast, she has returned to Equestria with Twilight, and is slowly reintegrating into Equestrian life. Her guilt for her actions weighs heavily on her, and she has taken to traveling the land to aid any who need it. Now with Equestria in peril and Harmony at stake, she has happily volunteered to aid us.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

During her first few years, she oversaw the reestablishment of the Wonderbolts as not only a military group, but also as a way to entertain civilians and encourage them to sign up through various shows that later would occur on an annual basis. Although the Wonderbolts were never short of recruits, the numbers did indeed increase, and it has maintained a healthy glut of applicants since.\n\nOn the field, she has a reputation as being fierce, no-nonsense, and dominant, with a temper that can sometimes flare up when she gets riled. While this is true, it is because of her responsibility as captain and her desire to see all under her master the flying art that she pushes them to their limits, while keeping them tightly controlled and regulated. Off duty, she is far more lax around her friends and fellow Wonderbolts, although any caught mentioning some of her favorite, less than rugged hobbies tend to wind up pulling KP or latrine duty for a few weeks.\n\nSince she has tens of thousands of hours in experience, she has volunteered to direct our aerial warfare division, and has already offered many ideas of how we can improve it.§!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §LScroup§!"

Most of her history is redacted in her dossier, and aside from small notes regarding her date of birth and home, little is publicly available, and most data is likely fabricated.\n\nWhat Sweetie Drops lacks in a public backstory, she makes up for in her dedication to protecting Harmony. Shortly after finishing her secondary education in Luna Nova, she was recruited by S.M.I.L.E. after she ingeniously used her confectionary skills to prevent a rampaging pride of manticores from terrorizing her suburb. The special treats were laced with a sleeping agent, which she acquired from one of the local plants outside the city.\n\nHer ingenuity earned her a position within the agency, and for the next decade she spent her time keeping mythical monsters at bay. One of her most imporant cases was apprehending by herself a rogue bugbear who threatened to destroy Canterlot on its rampage with only her bare hooves and a bottle of salsa. Foreign affairs were not her forte, but occasionally she was tasked with scouting the border lands between the changelings and Equestria and was almost sent in to stabilize Stalliongrad during its revolution.\n\nHowever, after a high-profile failure of losing their top guard dog, Cerberus, and thereby allowing the bugbear she captured to escape Tartarus, S.M.I.L.E. was dissolved by royal decree. Sweetie Drops exiled herself to Ponyville to remain in deep cover as Bon Bon.

Zebra were uncommon, but not a rare sight upon the shores of Eastern Equestria, so she arrived with little fanfare.\n\nYet she moved inland, wandering from town to town, occasionally offering her brewing services in exchange for either a place to sleep or some bits to make do. In time, she arrived in the region of Central Equestria and Ponyville, where the insulated populace were unnerved by her traditional zebra garb and mannerisms. One of her first encounters with the residents involved her seeking a few plants for her medical supplies, which she had to eventually abandon when nopony would speak with her. As she left, she passed by the Everfree Forest and spotted a couple of rare species, at least for Zebrica.\n\nAfter exploring the forest more, she found an appropriately-sized, partly hollowed-out tree, which she expanded and converted into a home. Her occasional excursions into Ponyville were always cause for panic, as she went about searching for more flora to acquire for her potion brewing.

In the time of Flash, his ancestor served on a team of chosen fliers to prevent a meteorological disaster from striking some deer settlements along the shores of later Equestrian territory. Said crisis was caused by a failure in the weather weaver of Cloudsdale, which sent a large storm, filled to the brim with hailstones and tornadoes, toward the deer shores in the north. When they arrived, the deer forbade them from assisting, as they tried in vain to use their own magic to stop the tempest.\n\nWhile Grimhoof, first of his name, initially obeyed the orders of the Royal Legion's commander, Ironhead, when Flash Magnus went on through and assisted the ailing deer, he and the other members followed. The modern Grimhoof is just as serious and dedicated as his ancestor, but has not had the chance to prove himself like in ancient times.\n\nAs he received his training in Cloudsdale's Royal Military Academy, he is part of the Cloudsdale Royal Guard and is one of the commanding officers there. His study of early pegasus history, like Commander Hurricane, has inspired his military theory of hard-hitting, aggressive assaults. Although this has put him in conflict in the past with the Equestrian military at large, as it has helped keep the area of Cloudsdale clear of any dangers like manticores or ursa minors, it has not been seen as a detriment.

In times past, he and his fellow Pillars were idolized as mythical champions who battled monsters, saved towns and villages, and kept the heartbeat of Harmony alive from the ever-present threat of evil wishing to smother its flame. Unlike most folk tales and fables, the majority of them are true, as he, along with Star Swirl the Bearded and the other Pillars, helped Princesses Celestia and Luna keep the young realm of Equestria safe and secure.\n\nAs he often likes to espouse, he was but a wee lad for many years, scrawny and weak, and frequently the laughingstock of his village, which sat at the base of one of the many volcanic islands in the Spa Islands chain. While he was allowed to associate with the Mighty Helm, the village's elite guard, he was given menial tasks, such as digging trenches. However, that mockery turned into his village's salvation when the volcano erupted, and the villagers refused to leave their one and only home. In a fit of desperation and care for his friends and family, he began to dig, dig, and dig. Through the extreme exertion and channeling of earth pony magic, his body transformed into the large, muscular pony he is today, and his village was rescued.\n\nAfter word of his deed reached Star Swirl, the mage befriended and recruited him to help guard Equestria. When all the Pillars returned from their time in Limbo, Rockhoof found it the most challenging of his peers to adapt to the modern world. He was a warrior, but Equestria was now at peace. However, due to his skill of stories and desire to keep the memory of his old friends and family alive, he has been made the official Keeper of Tales of Equestria by Princess Twilight, and now with war ahoof, he has eagerly requested to join in active duty to aid Equestria's defense once again.§!"

While most legends about historical figures end up being stretched to the point of absurdity, the majority of those told of Flash's life before being stranded in Limbo are truthful, with only mild deviation from reality. Flash has yet to comment on which ones are accurate and which are not.\n\nLike most young stallions in Cloudsdale in early Equestria, Flash was trained in combat and warfare during his formative years. At that time, Cloudsdale was tasked with guarding both the Princesses' lives as well as protecting the outer fringes of the nation, which was much smaller before Luna's banishment. He talks little of his infancy, but speaks freely when asked of his time in the Cloudsdale Royal Legion, one of whom formed the Wonderbolts hundreds of years later. While he was still a cadet, he, his squad, and his commanding officer, Ironhead, were on a routine patrol through the southern edge of Equestria, over part of the Badlands. When his squad was attacked and captured by several dragons, he was the only survivor willing to go after them, and after convincing Ironhead of his plan of distraction, was gifted the fire-proof shield, Netitus.\n\nHis cunning idea succeeded, and he was rewarded with keeping the shield. Eventually, Star Swirl the Bearded met with him and offered him a place in protecting Equestria as a whole from even greater threats. When he and the other Pillars returned from Limbo, he returned to active duty, as he claimed he had many years left of service he could give to Equestria.

Born to working-class parents in Whinnyapolis, he had a busy, hard-working life, which gave him the attitude of accomplishing anything, no matter the cost and by any means necessary. As he was middle foal of his family, most of the attention went to his elder sister or younger brother, further feeding into his sense of overachieving.\n\nWhen the Wonderbolts, under Captain Swallowtail, required further cadets to help defend Equestria's borders from some changeling incursions, he jumped at the opportunity from his job as a weather clearer around the sooty industrial heart of his home city. In his training, he broke a number of academy records, which stood the test of time for decades, even after his retirement in 992 ALB. He could have continued, but as he informed the younger captain Spitfire, he'd gone in a blaze of glory like a fireball, and it was time to enjoy the fruits of his labor.\n\nWhile he was on the team, he was one of the most popular fliers, which earned him a substantial pay bump, especially when he set world records in flight times and aerial acrobatics. These were untouched until Rainbow Dash shattered practically all aviation records through her sonic rainboom, and later her honed training at the Wonderbolt academy. Although he maintained a veneer of courteousness, when opportunity presented itself to potentially get her ousted from the Wonderbolts during a reunion, and thereby her achievements tarnished or expunged, he took it. However, his plot was uncovered by Rarity and he was stripped of his rank and titles by Spitfire instead.\n\nIn the wake of Daybreaker dissolving the Wonderbolts, he has offered to fill the gap Spitfire has left.

While he didn't challenge Rainbow Dash for speed, he still looked to her as a role model for how to be an effective and efficient controller of the skies. When he was first called upon for something greater by funneling water up to Cloudsale with the rest of the Ponyville pegasus population, he had a case of the feather flu and was unable to attend. Afterward, given the teasing from Rainbow Dash at his job, he resolved to be accepted into the Wonderbolts, like her.\n\nWhen Rainbow Dash was indeed approved to begin training with the Wonderbolts, he was enrolled as well.

Although he hails from Saltlickingham, his family home was much closer to the lake which feeds the river going near it than the city itself. Although he was always provided for, the simple rice farming that was his family's staple barely covered the cost of the land, let alone further expenses like clothing, food, and water.\n\nMuch of his early life had been characterized by tribulation, either due to the poverty that racked his rural community or from the constant fighting between himself and his older sibling, who saw him as little more than an irritant and a sponge for his parents' attention. Although there was never outright animosity, arguments and spats, which his brother usually won due to the almost decade-wide age difference between the two of them, slowly gnawed on his psyche and his peace of mind while ever on the farmstead. As an escape, he ventured through the woods and jungles that characterize he region around Saltlickingham, over time adapting and thriving under the thick canopies.\n\nAll through his foalhood, another source of derision from his brother was his blank flank, which remained cutie markless far longer than most of his peers. However, in the early 990s ALB, Princess Celestia visited his town on one of her infrequent tours of the nation. With the entire town present and flocking to her, the wildlife of the surrounding jungles grew bolder. While ultimately the Princess was not in danger, when he alerted the guard to a band of Timberwolves approaching the Princess's podium, he finally felt a calling. A tingling in his flank and bright glow declared how he was destined to guard the Princess and Equestria as a whole. When Luna returned and her Lunar Guard was reformed, recruiters traveled throughout the nation looking for willing ponies who would die to protect the reformed Princess. Despite the arduous regimen, he passed with flying colors, and helped defend the city against Chrysalis's invasion in 1002. In the aftermath, he earned his commissioned rank after taking numerous changeling magic bolts to defend a group of civilians.\n\nCool and reserved, his natural aptitude to the forest and jungles have made him a go-to for training missions in the shrouded lands of the South-East and Equestrian North.§!\n\n§YPortrait By:§! §LScroup§!"

These siblings, whose names have been lost to time, had the magic of unicorns, flight of pegasi, and strength of earth ponies. Likewise, the eldest always took upon herself the mantle of the sun, while the younger bore the responsibility of the moon. The tales have morphed, changed, and altered over time, but the core truth of two creatures, guiding ponies in harmony remained consistent.\n\nWhile these have existed for generations, they became real when two alicorn sisters, their fur and manes reflecting their seemingly divinely appointed roles, appeared in Equestria shortly after its formation by the three tribes. Like the tales, the elder sister, Celestia, controlled the sun and gave light to all, while the younger, Luna, commanded the moon and protected the dreams of every pony in the land. Their appointment as godlike princesses of ponies gave way to fanciful myths of their pre-Equestrian exploits. What details that exist of their past are well-known and legendary, for the sisters had in their time vanquished many of Equestria's gravest threats such as King Sombra, Lord Tirek, or Discord.\n\nYet, despite her accomplishments, Luna needed more. While Celestia had the love and acceptance of Equestria, Luna's work in the night meant she was rarely seen by her citizens, and they remained aloof and uncaring toward her.

  POLITICS_PONSE_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 17th of April, 959 ALB in Sancti Stallion\n\n§YBiography:§! Ponsé Cocktail has lived within politics even as a foal. Born the son of Puerto Caballo's second president, Flower Cocktail, he resided within the Presidential Residence within the capital city during her terms in office, a life of luxury that didn't blind him to the poverty that gripped many regions of the island. While his mother was president, she strove to, as she explained to him whenever he'd pop into her office while she was looking over new legislation, create an island paradise akin to a miniature Equestria. Everypony could be happy, and worry not about one's next paycheck, health, or prosperity.\n\nWhen he was old enough, he ran for a seat in Puerto Caballo's House of Representatives, where he served a single term before focusing on micropolitics. After his stay, he became mayor of the city of Puerto Caballo, and succeeded at running a number of anti-corruption campaigns and vitalizing the public sector. However, when his mother was defeated due to the rhetoric of Quesadilla, who then declared himself president for life, he was exiled by the dictator's lackeys to prevent a counter-revolutionary figure.\n\nIn 1004, a coup de tat by Buckio Buckista ousted and arrested President Quesadilla, and Ponsé was elected as Quesadilla's successor in an almost unanimous vote. With the results of the free election in, he set about continuing his mother's vision, and still labors to see the land he loves become a symbol of wealth, health, and happiness for generations to come.\n\n§YPortrait By:§!

  POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography:§! From the earliest of days pony history, there have been tales of great leaders, born of the heavens themselves, that bear the traits of all three tribes: the magic of unicorns, the flight of pegasi, and the strength of earth ponies. Although the original word in the ancient Ponish tongue has been lost for generations, the legacy of these super-pony rulers has lived on in myths, fables, and legends of amazing conflicts and even more stupendous acts of mercy and kindness.\n\nWhile these mythic stories have existed before the time of the three tribes' conflict, they became reality when Princesses Celestia and Luna arrived shortly after the fledgling nation of Equestria was established. Much of their past has remained a mystery, although the power that they wielded, with Celestia controlling the sun, and Luna commanding the moon, means that almost all ponies do not question their origin. Whether goddesses or normal ponies ascended by something greater than they, it matters little. Their accomplishments of defeating King Sombra, Discord, and Lord Tirek speak for themselves.\n\nHowever, despite her early past staying shrouded in darkness, Princess Celestia's history is well-understood. Celestia's life has been characterized by tragedy, as her sister, who grew envious of the adoration that Celestia received, nearly plunged Equestria, and the world, into eternal darkness. Forced to banish Luna with the Elements of Harmony, she has ruled Equestria for a thousand years. With Luna's recent return, she has relinquished her control of the moon and returned to her singular duties as co-princess of ponies.\n\nCalm, collected, and patient, Princess Celestia is potentially the most popular and loved creature in the world, as leaders across the globe recognize her as a proponent of peace and prosperity. Her citizens see her much like a mother to all, an image perpetuated by her love of her ponies. With Luna's return, she has focused her efforts on continuing world peace and continuing the golden age of Equestria for another thousand years.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! kelkessel"
